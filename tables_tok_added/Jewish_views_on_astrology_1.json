  "intro": "Astrology has been a topic of debate among Jews for over 2000 years. While not a Jewish practice or teaching as such, astrology made its way into Jewish thought, as can be seen in the many references to it in the Talmud. Astrological statements became accepted and worthy of debate and discussion by Torah scholars. Opinions varied: some rabbis rejected the validity of astrology; others accepted its validity but forbid practicing it; still others thought its practice to be meaningful and permitted. In modern times, as science has rejected the validity of astrology, many Jewish thinkers have similarly rejected it; though some continue to defend the pro-astrology views that were common among pre-modern Jews. In pre-modern Hebrew, astrology was known as hokmat ha-mazalot (\u05d7\u05d5\u05db\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0-\u05de\u05d6\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea), the science of the constellations."
