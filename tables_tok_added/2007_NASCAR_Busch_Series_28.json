  "section_text": "The CarFax 250 was held August 18 at the Michigan International Speedway . Greg Biffle won the pole . From the drop of the green flag , it was established that the two best cars belonged to Matt Kenseth and Denny Hamlin . Taking advantage of the multi-grooved racetrack , the two swapped lines almost every lap . However , the bigger story of the day was with Busch Series points leader Carl Edwards . Although his points lead in drivers standings was immense , that was not the case for owners points , as his two consecutive finishes of 30th or worse put the No . 29 car of Richard Childress Racing only 41 points behind . Edwards was hoping to get his season back on track . However , that was not to be as he got loose off of turn 2 and lost a lap , giving him another 30th or worse finish . While Edwards struggled , Hamlin dominated the race , leading 69 laps en route to his second win of the season . Top ten results :",
