  "uid": "YouTube_Rewind_2019:_For_the_Record_6",
  "intro": "YouTube Rewind 2019: For the Record (also known as YouTube Rewind 2019) is a video that was uploaded to YouTube's official channel on the video-sharing website YouTube on December 5, 2019, as part of the YouTube Rewind series. The video contains montages of the top videos and YouTubers of the year. Although marked as an improvement over the previous installment, , the video received negative reviews, with critics and the general audience finding the video uncreative in comparison to past Rewind videos. A reason given for the improvement over 2018's Rewind video is due to the addition of YouTubers, including MrBeast, Shane Dawson and PewDiePie, which had not been in the previous installment. It had amassed over 3.1 million dislikes within 24 hours of release and 5 million dislikes within 48 hours of release, which was more than what obtained in the same timeframes. It currently has more than 8.4 million dislikes, making it the third most-disliked YouTube video on the platform."
