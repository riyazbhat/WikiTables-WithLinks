  "intro": "Season 1999-2000 was Hibs' first season back in the top flight of Scottish football, the newly founded Scottish Premier League, after gaining promotion from the First Division in 1999. Hibs re-established themselves well in the top flight, finishing in sixth place. The club also had a good Scottish Cup run, but were disappointingly beaten 2-1 by Aberdeen, who finished bottom of the SPL, in the semi-final at Hampden Park. The season was also memorable for Hibs fans due to a 3-0 win in the Millennium derby against Hearts. There was a landmark day towards the end of the season, as the last game on the Easter Road slope was played."
