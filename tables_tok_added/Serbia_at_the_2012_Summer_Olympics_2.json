  "intro": "Serbia competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. This was the nation's third appearance at the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Committee of Serbia sent a total of 116 athletes to the Games, 80 men and 46 women, to compete in 15 sports. Volleyball, men's handball, men's water polo were the only team-based sports in which Serbia had its representation in these Olympic games. Among the sports played by the athletes, Serbia marked its Olympic debut in taekwondo. Notable Serbian athletes featured butterfly swimmer and Olympic silver medalist Milorad \u010cavi\u0107, and world number-one male tennis player and Olympic bronze medalist Novak Djokovic, who was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Pistol shooter and Olympic gold medalist Jasna \u0160ekari\u0107, the oldest of the team at age 47, became the first Serbian athlete to compete in seven Olympic games, and played as an individual competitor under five different banners. Two athletes, on the other hand, made their sixth Olympic appearance: rifle shooter Nemanja Mirosavljev, and high jumper Dragutin Topi\u0107. Water polo player Du\u0161an Mandi\u0107, at age 18, was the youngest athlete of the team. Serbia left London with a total of four Olympic medals (one gold, one silver, and two bronze). Taekwondo jin Milica Mandi\u0107 won Serbia's first ever gold medal in Olympic history as an independent nation. Meanwhile, the men's national water polo team managed to repeat its bronze medal from Beijing."
