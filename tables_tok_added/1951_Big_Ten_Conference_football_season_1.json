  "intro": "The 1951 Big Ten Conference football season was the 56th season of college football played by the member schools of the Big Ten Conference (also known as the Western Conference and the Big Nine Conference) and was a part of the 1951 college football season. The 1951 Illinois Fighting Illini football team, under head coach Ray Eliot, compiled a 9-0-1 record, won the Big Ten championship, was ranked No. 4 in the final AP poll, and defeated Stanford 40-7 in the 1952 Rose Bowl. The lone setback was a scoreless tie with Ohio State. Halfback Johnny Karras was the Big Ten's only consensus first-team All-American. Linebacker Chuck Boerio was selected as the team's most valuable player. The 1951 Wisconsin Badgers football team, under head coach Ivy Williamson, compiled a 7-1-1 record, led the conference in scoring defense (5.9 points allowed per game), and was ranked No. 8 in the final AP poll. Quarterback John Coatta was the first-team All-Big Ten quarterback. Defensive end Pat O'Donahue was selected as a first-team All-American by multiple selectors."
