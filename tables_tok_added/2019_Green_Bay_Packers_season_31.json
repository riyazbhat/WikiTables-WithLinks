  "intro": "The 2019 season is the Green Bay Packers' 99th season in the National Football League, their 101st overall and their first under new head coach Matt LaFleur. After suffering back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1990-91 and missing the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 2005-06, the Packers will return to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. With a Week 8 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, the Packers improved on their 6-9-1 record from last year, and a Week 10 win allowed them to surpass their wins from 2017. This also guarantees the Packers' first non-losing season since 2016. After a win over the New York Giants in Week 13 in the snow, the Packers secured their first winning season since 2016. A win over the Chicago Bears in Week 15 combined with a Los Angeles Rams loss helped the Packers clinch their first postseason after missing the playoffs for the last two years. They clinched the NFC North the following week with 23-10 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. With a Week 17 come from behind win over the Detroit Lions, the Packers not only earned a first-round bye in the playoffs, but swept the NFC North for the first time since 2011, and achieved their best record since that season as well."
