  "intro": "The 2019 season was the 5th season of competitive association football and 4th season in the Liga 1 played by Bali United Football Club, a professional football club based in Gianyar, Bali, Indonesia. Their 11th-place finish in 2018 meant it was their fourth successive season in Liga 1. This season would be Bali United's first with head coach Stefano Cugurra, who stepped in for Widodo Cahyono Putro. Coming into the season, Bali United were in the round of 32 of the Piala Indonesia for the first time in their history. The season would see the departures of original players such as I Made Wardana, I Gede Sukadana, Yandi Munawar, Novan Sasongko, Taufik Hidayat, Syaiful Cahya, Junius R. Bate, and Feby Eka Putra, as well as foreign recruits Nick van der Velden, Mahamadou N'Diaye, and Demerson. Players such as Haudi Abdillah, Samuel Reimas, Michael Orah, Willian Pacheco, Leonard Tupamahu, Fahmi Al-Ayyubi, Anan Lestaluhu, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio were brought in as replacements. On 2 December 2019, the club won their first official title since the club formed, after second place Borneo draw to PSM and followed by a 2-0 win at Semen Padang to give Bali United mathematical certainty of the title with four games to spare."
