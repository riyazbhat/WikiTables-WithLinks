  "section_text": "A map showing population density in the Otago Region at the 2006 census . The population of Otago is 236,200 , [ 1 ] which is approximately 4.8 percent of New Zealand 's total population of 4.9 million . About 44.2 percent of the population resides in the Dunedin urban area\u2014the region 's main city and the country 's sixth largest urban area . For historical and geographical reasons , Dunedin is usually regarded as one of New Zealand 's four main centres . Unlike other southern centres , Dunedin 's population has not declined since the 1970s , largely due to the presence of the University of Otago \u2013 and especially its medical school \u2013 which attracts students from all over New Zealand and overseas . [ 16 ] Other significant urban centres in Otago with populations over 1,000 include : Queenstown , Oamaru , Wanaka , Port Chalmers , Cromwell , Alexandra , Balclutha , Milton and Mosgiel . Between 1996 and 2006 , the population of the Queenstown Lakes District grew by 60% due to the region 's booming tourism industry . [ 17 ]",

  "intro": "Otago (/\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0\u0261o\u028a/ (listen), /o\u028a-, \u0252-/, Maori: \u014ct\u0101kou [\u0254:\u02c8ta:kou]) is a region of New Zealand in the south of the South Island administered by the Otago Regional Council. It has an area of approximately 32,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi), making it the country's third largest local government region. Its population was 232,300 in June 2018. The name Otago is an Anglicisation of Otakou, the name of the M\u0101ori village near the entrance to the harbour. The exact meaning of the term is disputed, with common translations being isolated village and place of red earth, the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin. Otago is also the old name of the European settlement on the Otago Harbour, established by the Weller Brothers in 1831, which lies close to the modern harbourside community of Otakou. The place later became the focus of the Otago Association, an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland, notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people, not the landowner, should choose the ministers. Major centres include Dunedin (the principal city), Oamaru (made famous by Janet Frame), Balclutha, Alexandra, and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wanaka. Kaitangata in South Otago is a prominent source of coal. The Waitaki and Clutha rivers provide much of the country's hydroelectric power. Some parts of the area originally covered by Otago Province are now administered by either Canterbury Regional Council or Southland Regional Council. The Central Otago wine region produces award-winning wines made from varieties such as the Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Merlot and Riesling grapes."
