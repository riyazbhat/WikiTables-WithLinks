  "intro": "Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport is a civil-military airport 5 miles (8 km) south of downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019-2023, in which it is categorized as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility. It is named after United States Army Air Service General Billy Mitchell, who was raised in Milwaukee and is often regarded as the father of the United States Air Force. Along with being the primary airport for Milwaukee, Mitchell International has sometimes been described as Chicago's third airport, as many travelers in the suburbs north of Chicago use it instead of Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports. It is also used by travellers throughout Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. An Amtrak railway station opened at the airport in 2005; the station is served by Amtrak's Hiawatha Service running between Chicago and Milwaukee several times daily. Since March 1941, the airport's weather station has been used as the official point for Milwaukee weather observations and records by the National Weather Service, whose area office is located in Sullivan. Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport is accessible from Interstate 41/Interstate 94/US Highway 41 (North-South Freeway) and Wisconsin Highway 38 (S. Howell Avenue) via Wisconsin Highway 119 (Airport Spur)."
