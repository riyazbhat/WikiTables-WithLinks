  "intro": "Allt f\u00f6r Sverige (literally Everything for Sweden, marketed in the United States as The Great Swedish Adventure) is a Swedish Emmy-award-winning reality show based on the original Norwegian format The Great Norway Adventure, also called Alt for Norge. The first season of Allt f\u00f6r Sverige was shown on Sveriges Television SVT1 from 30 October 2011 to 18 December 2011. The series is about Swedish Americans who return to their Swedish roots. The program provides the participants more information about their ancestral families by visiting some locations their ancestors lived. The cast members learn about the country's culture, customs, food, and quirks. As the episodes in the season progress, cast members leave the show after losing challenges and therefore find out less about their ancestry. Each season's winner gets a family reunion with their current relatives who stayed behind in Sweden. The host of the program is Anders Lundin."
