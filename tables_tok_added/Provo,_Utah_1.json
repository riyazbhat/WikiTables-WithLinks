  "intro": "Provo /\u02c8pro\u028avo\u028a/ is the third-largest city in Utah, United States. It is 43 miles (69 km) south of Salt Lake City along the Wasatch Front. Provo is the largest city and county seat of Utah County. It is home to Brigham Young University, and Sundance Resort is located just northeast of the city. While Father Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante, a Spanish Franciscan missionary-explorer, is considered the first European visitor to the area that would become Provo, the first permanent settlement was established in 1849 as Fort Utah. The name was changed to Provo in 1850, in honor of \u00c9tienne Provost, an early French-Canadian trapper. Provo's climate lies in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate and humid continental climate, with temperatures averaging between about 94 \u00b0F or 34.4 \u00b0C in the summer and 40 \u00b0F or 4.4 \u00b0C in the winter. Average annual precipitation (rain and snow) is just under 20 inches (51 cm). The population of Provo has grown from 2030 in 1860 to an estimated 116,702 in 2018. The 2010 census showed slightly more females than males, with over 55% of the population living as couples, and almost 35% of households having children under the age of 18. The population is over 90% Christian, with almost 89% being Latter Day Saints. The economy in Provo is powered by many different businesses and organizations, including over 100 restaurants, two shopping malls, multiple universities and colleges, a number of small companies, and several large international businesses."
