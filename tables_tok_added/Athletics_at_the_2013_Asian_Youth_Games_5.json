  "intro": "At the 2013 Asian Youth Games, the athletics events were held in Nanjing, Jiangsu province in China from 19-22 August. A total of 34 events were contested, split evenly between the sexes. The Nanjing Olympic Sports Centre was the host stadium for the athletics - this was the venue's second hosting of a multi-sport event after the 2005 National Games of China. The events attracted average crowds of 20,000 people per day to the stadium. The competition was open to any youth athletes aged fifteen or sixteen. It was part of the buildup to the 2014 Youth Olympics, to be held at the same location. A total of 376 athletes from 37 nations participated at the event. Indian athletes were entered as Independent Olympic Participants due to the suspension of the Indian Olympic Association. Poor organisation between the Athletics Federation of India and the national association meant the country sent eighteen athletes who was born before 1997 and could not compete due to their being over the age limit. One of Myanmar's two entrants was dismissed for the same reason. The host nation China easily topped the medal table, taking over half the available gold medals (18) and ending the competition with a total of 33 medals. Japan won the next most gold medals with four in their haul of nine medals."
