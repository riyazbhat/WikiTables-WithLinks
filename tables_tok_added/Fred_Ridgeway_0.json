  "intro": "Frederick Gerrard Ridgeway (16 October 1953 - 12 November 2012) was an Irish-born stage and television actor. He began his professional life pursuing a career as a money broker, but at the age of 42, he decided to take up professional acting. He performed in a variety of stage productions across the UK, including several Richard Bean plays and a number of Royal Shakespeare Company productions. His final role was as Charlie Clench in One Man, Two Guvnors, which toured the UK as well as appearing in Broadway theatre. Prior to its Broadway run, Ridgeway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, from which he died in November 2012."
