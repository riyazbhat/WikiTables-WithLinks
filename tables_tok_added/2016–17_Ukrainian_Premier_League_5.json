  "intro": "The 2016-17 Ukrainian Premier League season is the 26th top level football club competitions since the fall of the Soviet Union and the ninth since the establishment of the Ukrainian Premier League. The league is scheduled to play its first 18 rounds before the winter break (10 December 2016 - 25 February 2017) finishing its first stage of tournament in March. The second stage is scheduled to start on 1 April 2017 and finish on 31 May 2017. The league's title sponsor for 2016-17 season as for the previous season is a bookmaker company Parimatch, the title of which is displayed on the season shield. With the continuation of the military conflict in the eastern oblasts (regions) of Ukraine since 2014 and the Russian occupation of Crimea (see the map), the league was forced to change its format again and will now be contested by 12 teams after being cut from 14 in the 2015-16 season. Dynamo Kyiv were the defending champions. On 6 May 2017 in Kharkiv, Shakhtar Donetsk secured its 10th championship title with a win over Zorya Luhansk and four more rounds to play in the season. The 10th title that Shakhtar earned this season would allow the club to place a star on the club's crest to indicate this feat."
