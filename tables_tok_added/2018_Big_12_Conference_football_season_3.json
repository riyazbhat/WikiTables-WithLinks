  "intro": "The 2018 Big 12 Conference football season represents the 23rd season of Big 12 conference football, talking place during the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The season began with non-conference play on Thursday, August 30, 2018. Big 12 Conference play will begin on Saturday, September 22, 2018. The 2018 season will be the seventh for the Big 12 since the 2010-13 Big 12 Conference realignment brought the Big 12 membership to its current form. As a ten-team league, the Big 12 will play a nine-game round-robin conference schedule and each member will play three non-conference games-one of which must be against another Power Five conference foe. The regular season will be followed by a conference championship game played between the regular-season champion and regular-season runner-up. The 2018 Big 12 Championship Game was held on Saturday, December 1, 2018. Oklahoma defeated Texas 39-27 to win their 12th Big 12 Championship."
