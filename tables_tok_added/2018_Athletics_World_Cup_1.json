  "intro": "The 2018 Athletics World Cup was held in London, United Kingdom, from 14 to 15 July 2018. This was the first edition of this competition. Each team entered one athlete per event, and points were gained on the basis of finishing position. Although the majority of World championship events were contested, no races over 1500 metres were held, and no road events or multievents are on the program. The competition focused on an overall team prize, team prize money, The Platinum Trophy and Platinum team medals, but individual gold, silver and bronze medals were also awarded in each individual event. While the event is organised outside of the official IAAF structures, the IAAF has expressed support for the event notwithstanding the existence of its own IAAF Continental Cup event. The United States won the inaugural edition, finishing ahead of Poland, with Great Britain and Northern Ireland in third overall."
