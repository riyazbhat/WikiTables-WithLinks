  "intro": "Idol: Jakten p\u00e5 en superstjerne 2005 was the third season of Idol Norway based on the British singing competition Pop Idol. It premiered one year after the second season and was aired in the first half of 2005. Ingrid Gjessing was replaced by K\u00e5re Magnus Bergh and with Jan Fredrik Karlsen's departure the entire judging panel was changed with Tone-Lise Skagefoss becoming the new jury foreperson. It was also the first time that two girls faced off each other in the final 2 showdown making Jorun Stiansen the first female winner over Tone Damli Aaberge. Aaberge would attempt to represent Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009 where she ended up being the runner-up, this time to Alexander Rybak who later went on to win the contest. Ironically Rybak has also been a contestant on Idol 2005 and in the same semifinal group as Aaberge. However while Aaberge went on winning her group, Rybak did not even manage to reach the top 5 and therefore missed out a spot in the group of final 12. Second runner-up Alejandro Fuentes was able to top VG-lista (Norwegian Single Charts) three times between 2005 and 2007. One if these no. 1 Hits was a collaboration with Askil Holm, Espen Lind and Kurt Nilsen (winner of season one). The quartet also went on tour under the name The New Guitar Buddies."
