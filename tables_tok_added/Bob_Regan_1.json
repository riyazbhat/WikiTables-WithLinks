His chart credits include Busy Man by Billy Ray Cyrus, Your Everything by Keith Urban, Soon by Tanya Tucker, Thinkin' About You by Trisha Yearwood, Running Out of Reasons to Run by Rick Trevino, 'Til Love Comes Again by Reba McIntire, We've Got It Made by Lee Greenwood, Something About a Woman by Jake Owen and many others. His songs have been recorded by artists ranging from Andy Williams to Hank Williams Jr., from Kenny Rogers to cowboy hero Roy Rogers. Regan was a three-term President of the Board and legislative chair of the Nashville Songwriters Association International. In that role in 2006, he helped pass the Songwriters Capital Gains Tax Equity Act. Regan also taught as an adjunct professor at Belmont University in the inaugural year of their songwriting program. In 2012, after performing on several Armed Forces Entertainment tours at military bases around the world, Regan founded Operation Song\u2122, a program which brings professional songwriters together with veterans and active duty military to help them tell their stories through songs. As of 2018, there have been over 650 songs written in the program with veterans of WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and their families. The songs have been performed on the National Mall in Washington DC on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry and on radio and television programs worldwide."
