  "section_title": "Fleet -- Current",
  "section_text": "As of 2018 [ update ] , the conservation society operates twelve ships , the MV Brigitte Bardot , the MY Bob Barker , the MY Sam Simon , the RV Martin Sheen , the MY Jairo Mora Sandoval , a new MY Farley Mowat , the MV John Paul DeJoria , [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] the MY Ocean Warrior , the MV Sharpie , the MV Emanuel Bronner , MY Alchemy , and the MV White Holly . The 1200-tonne Bob Barker , was named after famous television game-show host and animal activist Bob Barker , who made the purchase of the retired Norwegian whaling vessel possible with a donation of US $ 5 million . [ 25 ] This ship and the Irwin were both given new dazzle paint jobs in 2011 . They are easier to tell apart now since the Irwin has a 77 painted on its bow while the Bob Barker has a sharks mouth design on its bow . MV Brigitte Bardot docked in Circular Quay , Sydney Sea Shepherd acquired the Ocean 7 Adventurer for its 2011 campaign against Japanese whaling in the Antarctic , renaming it MV Gojira . [ 26 ] After a legal claim , Sea Shepherd have renamed the MV Gojira and the vessel is now known as MV Brigitte Bardot . [ 27 ] On December 29 , 2011 the vessel was damaged by a 6 m ( 20 ft ) rogue wave whilst pursuing the Japanese whaling fleet during Operation Divine Wind off the western coast of Australia . The main hull was cracked and the port side pontoon needed to be held together by straps . [ 28 ] In response to this incident and new tactics employed by the Japanese whaling fleet , Paul Watson has stated that he intends to procure more vessels to prevent themselves being outnumbered and shorthanded in future engagements . To this end , Sea Shepherd acquired the 56 m ( 184 ft ) long MY Sam Simon in June 2012 , the vessel being named after the co-creator of The Simpsons who made a sizable donation to finance the vessel 's purchase . Sam Simon was formerly operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency at the Maizuru Marine Laboratory under the name Seifu Maru . [ 29 ] In January 2015 , Sea Shepherd USA purchased two recently decommissioned U.S. Coast Guard patrol vessels . They are considerably faster than the other ships , with a top speed of 30 knots . These two ships are both 110-foot ( 34 m ) Island-class patrol boats and are named MY John Paul DeJoria , ( formerly named Jules Verne ) and MY Farley Mowat . [ 30 ] In December 2017 , Sea Shepherd unveiled a third U.S. Coast Guard patrol vessel , the MV Sharpie . This vessel is identical to the Farley Mowat and the John Paul DeJoria . On January 26 , 2015 , at the annual Goed Geld Gala ( Good Money Gala ) in Amsterdam , Sea Shepherd received a donation of \u20ac8.3 million ( $ 9.4 million ) to purchase a new vessel for Sea Shepherd 's submitted dream project `` Stop Illegal Fishing in the Southern Ocean '' . The vessel was built by Dutch ship builder Damen in Turkey , [ 31 ] with a final cost of $ 12 million . [ 32 ] This custom-built ship is a Damen Stan patrol vessel 50 m long and 9 m wide . It was christened MY Ocean Warrior and it was launched in September 2016 . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] The Ocean Warrior is the current flagship , it has four engines capable of a maximum speed of 30 knots ( 56 km/h ) , so it can outrun any ship in Japan 's whaling fleet ; it is also equipped with additional long-range fuel tanks . [ 32 ] Its maiden voyage was to be part of the 2016-2017 Operation Nemesis in the Southern Ocean .",

  "intro": "Neptune's Navy is the name that the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society uses to refer to the ships it operates. Most of these vessels are used to disrupt or hinder fishing, whaling or sealing operations that the group considers illegal."
