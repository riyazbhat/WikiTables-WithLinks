  "intro": "Ali Karimi (Persian: \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u06cc Persian: [\u0251li k\u00e6ri\u02c8mi] (listen); born 8 November 1978) is an Iranian football coach and retired player. He has played for Fath Tehran, Persepolis, Al-Ahli Dubai, Bayern Munich, Qatar SC, Steel Azin, Schalke 04, Tractor Sazi, and the Iran national team for which he scored 38 goals in 127 appearances. In 2004, he became the fourth Iranian player to win the Asian Footballer of the Year. He announced his retirement at the end of the 2013-14 season and, on 11 April 2014, played the final game of his 18-year career. Karimi's professional career began with Fath Tehran, where he made his first-team debut in 1996 aged 18. He then played three seasons with Persepolis, winning the Iranian league twice and the Hazfi Cup once with the club. In July 2001 Karimi signed a two-year contract with UAE Pro League club Al-Ahli Dubai. While an Al-Ahli player, Karimi won two cup titles, and was the top-goalscorer in the 2003-04 season, an impressive feat for a midfielder. After leaving the club in 2005 aged-26, Karimi made a long-awaited move to Europe to play for Bayern Munich. At the club he had relative success, winning both the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal in 2005-06 season. Later in his career, he rejoined former coach Felix Magath and won a second German Cup with Schalke 04. Karimi ended his playing career in Iran with Persepolis and Tractor Sazi, and with the latter won the Hazfi Cup in the final season of his career."
