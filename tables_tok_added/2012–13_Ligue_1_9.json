  "intro": "The 2012-13 Ligue 1 was the 75th season since its establishment. Montpellier were the defending champions. The league schedule was announced in April 2012 and the fixtures were determined on 30 May. The season began on 10 August and ended on 26 May 2013. A winter break was in effect from 24 December to 12 January 2013. The season marked the 80th anniversary of professional football in France. In addition, German sportswear company adidas became the official provider of match balls for the season after agreeing to a long-term partnership with the Ligue de Football Professionnel. To commemorate the 80th anniversary, adidas unveiled an exclusive ball, known as Le 80, for the new season. Since France dropped from fifth to sixth place in the UEFA association coefficient rankings at the end of the 2011-12 season, the league's third place team, Lyon qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2013-14 UEFA Champions League, having previously been placed in the playoff round. On 12 May, Paris Saint-Germain won the league title after a 1-0 away win against Lyon."
