  "section_text": "Main article : List of oil spills Crude oil and refined fuel spills from tanker ship accidents have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska , the Gulf of Mexico , the Galapagos Islands , France , the Sundarbans , Ogoniland , and many other places . The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons ( e.g. , Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill , Atlantic Empress , Amoco Cadiz ) , [ 4 ] but volume is a limited measure of damage or impact . Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems , such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill because of the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of an emergency environmental response . Since 2004 , between 300 and 700 barrels of oil per day have been leaking from the site of an oil-production platform 12 miles off the Louisiana coast which sank in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan . The oil spill , which officials estimate could continue throughout the 21st century , will eventually overtake the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizion disaster as the largest ever , but there are currently no efforts to cap the many leaking well heads . [ 5 ] Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land , since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil . These can kill seabirds , mammals , shellfish and other organisms they coat . Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes , and land animals can avoid the oil more easily .",

  "intro": "An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, diesel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel, or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil. Oil spills penetrate into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up. Oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society; economically, environmentally, and socially. As a result, oil spill accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar, bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills and what actions can best prevent them from happening."
