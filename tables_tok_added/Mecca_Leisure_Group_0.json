  "intro": "Mecca Leisure Group (also known as Mecca Leisure Ltd, Mecca Ltd, and Mecca Dance Ltd) was a British business that ran nightclubs, hotels, theme parks, bingo parlors and Hard Rock Cafes. During the 1960s, Mecca was a centre of entertainment with numerous nightclubs throughout major United Kingdom towns and cities. Mecca ballrooms were used for the BBC TV show Come Dancing. Eric Morley was a general manager of dancing at Mecca Leisure Group and was involved in the Miss World competitions. Notable DJs performing at Mecca nightclubs include Jimmy Savile from 1960 and Pete Waterman. The Coventry Locarno is the subject of the Specials song Friday Night, Saturday Morning, B-side to Ghost Town. Also, Chuck Berry's live version of My Ding-a-Ling was recorded there."
