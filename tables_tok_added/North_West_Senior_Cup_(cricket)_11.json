  "intro": "The North West Senior Cup is the most important provincial cricket knock-out cup of the North West jurisdiction in Ireland. The competition is open to teams playing in the North West Senior League. It is sponsored by Bank of Ireland and marketed as the Bank of Ireland Senior Cup. The competition began in 1888 as the County Londonderry Senior Cup, with twelve clubs entering the first competition in which Limavady beat Donemana in the first final at St Columb's Court, Lone Moor Road, Derry. The cup was organised on a league basis between 1894 and 1897, and there was no competition between 1898 and 1902. It became the North West Senior Cup in 2007."
