  "intro": "Serbian cultural sites in Kosovo were systematically destroyed during the Ottoman rule and consequent migrations, World War II, Kosovo War and 2004 unrest. According to the International Center for Transitional Justice, 155 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries were destroyed by Kosovo Albanians between June 1999 and March 2004. Because of Serbian medieval history and monuments, Kosovo has been called by Serbs as the Serbian Jerusalem. Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 was built in the 13th century and became the residence of the Serbian Archbishops. The region of Kosovo was an important part of the 14th-century Serbian Empire, with Prizren serving as capital, until the Ottoman invasion and conquest following the Battle of Kosovo (1389), considered one of the most notable events of Serbian history. During the Ottoman reign, the constant persecutions of Serbs caused migrations to regions under the rule of Habsburg Monarchy. The Medieval Monuments in Kosovo, founded by the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, is a combined World Heritage Site consisting of four Serbian Orthodox Christian churches and monasteries. In 2006, the property was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger."
