It was established in 1981 by Amblin Entertainment as a small-screen production arm for Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories anthology for NBC. The company has produced television series including Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, SeaQuest DSV, ER, Falling Skies, and The Americans. In 2012, DreamWorks Television, producer of such series as Spin City, Taken, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, United States of Tara, Smash, and the HBO film All the Way, was merged into Amblin Television. Since then, the combined company has produced television shows including The Borgias, Under the Dome, The Haunting of Hill House and Roswell, New Mexico."
