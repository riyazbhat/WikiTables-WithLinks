  "section_text": "HTV-2 departing Tanegashima spaceport bound for the International space station Initially seven missions were planned in 2008\u20132015 . With the extension of ISS project after 2015 through 2020 , three more missions are planned , possibly replacing the tenth flight with an improved , cost-reduced version ( HTV-X ) . [ 11 ] The first vehicle was launched on an H-IIB rocket , a more powerful version of the earlier H-IIA , at 17:01 GMT on 10 September 2009 , from Launch Pad 2 of the Yoshinobu Launch Complex at the Tanegashima Space Center . [ 12 ] The improved version of the craft HTV-X is planned to be first used for the tenth flight and will perform scheduled ISS resupply duties for 2021-2024 ( with a first launch scheduled for February 2022 ) . [ 15 ] In addition JAXA has agreed to provide HTV-X logistic resupply flights to the Gateway space station ( launched by either Falcon Heavy or Ariane 6 ) as part of its Gateway contribution in addition to co-developing a habitation module with the ESA .

  "intro": "The H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), also called , is an expendable, automated cargo spacecraft used to resupply the Kib\u014d Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) and the International Space Station (ISS). The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been working on the design since the early 1990s. The first mission, HTV-1, was originally intended to be launched in 2001. It launched at 17:01 UTC on 10 September 2009 on an H-IIB launch vehicle. The name Kounotori was chosen for the HTV by JAXA because a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV's mission to transport essential materials to the ISS."
