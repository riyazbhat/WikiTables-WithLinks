  "intro": "Martha's Vineyard Airport is a public airport located in the middle of the island of Martha's Vineyard, three miles (5 km) south of the central business district of Vineyard Haven, in Dukes County, Massachusetts, United States. This airport is owned by Dukes County and lies on the border between the towns of West Tisbury and Edgartown. It is often used for general aviation but is also served by four commercial airlines. The call sign has entered into general use as an abbreviation for the island of Martha's Vineyard as well, much like ACK for Nantucket. One of the local radio stations goes by MVY and it is in general use as shorthand for the entire island."
