  "intro": "Who Let the Dogs Out? is a British children's Dog training Game show that aired on the CBBC Channel since 21 September 2011. The show's name is widely derived from the song Who Let the Dogs Out? by Baha Men. In each episode, three dogs and their child owners battle it out to take home the Who Let the Dogs Out? trophy by tackling different dog tricks at the Dog House; such as skateboarding, skipping, frisbee catching and walking on two legs. A second series was aired in 2012. A third and fourth series aired in 2013 and 2014, with presenters Ashleigh Butler and Steve Mann. A spin-off series, Who Let the Dogs Out and About? aired for ten episodes, beginning on 19 January 2013."
