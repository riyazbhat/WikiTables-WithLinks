  "section_text": "In 2014 India inaugurated the Swachh Bharat Mission , a five-year nationwide cleanup effort . Before this national consolidated effort for systematic and total waste management came into common consciousness , many cities and towns in India had already launched individual efforts directed at municipal waste collection of segregated waste , either based on citizen activism and/or municipal efforts to set up sustainable systems . Some examples are Swach based in Pune ( formed in 1993 ) , [ 17 ] Clean Cities Championship in Warangal , Nirmal Bhavanam , Nirmal Nagaram or Clean Homes , Clean City in Alappuzha , Engage 14 campaign in Gangtok , Zero Waste in Bobbili , Andhra Pradesh , Waste Management in Mysore and Solid Waste Management Round Table , Bangalore ( formed in 2009 ) . [ 18 ] Bangalore 's Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike was directed by the High Court of Karnataka to implement mandatory segregation of municipal waste at the household level before collection - a first for the country . [ 19 ] This was a direct effort of citizen-based activism at a local level , and the litigation was led by notable activists such as Almitra Patel and Nalini Shekar . Following this High Court ruling , other cities in India have followed suit to make segregation of municipal waste mandatory at the generator level , Mumbai [ 20 ] being a notable example .",

  "intro": "Waste management in India falls under the purview of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). In 2016 this ministry released the Solid Wastage Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, these rules replaced the Municipal Solid Wastages (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 which had been in place for 16 years. Urban India (about 377 million people) generates 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste each year, of this about 43 million tonnes (70%) is collected and 11.9 million tonnes (20%) is treated. About 31 million tonnes (50%) is dumped in landfill sites. With changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth it is estimated that urban municipal solid waste generation will increase to 165 million tonnes in 2030."
