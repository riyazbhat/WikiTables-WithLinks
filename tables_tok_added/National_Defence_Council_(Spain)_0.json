'' He had been joined by most of his fellow conspirators by 8 p.m. Besteiro , the most prominent person among them , proposed that Casado become both president and responsible for defense . Casado said he would only temporarily preside over the council until General Miaja arrived from Valencia .

  "intro": "The National Defence Council () was the governing body in Republican Spain at the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). The council seized power with Colonel Segismundo Casados coup on 5 March 1939 when it was clear that the Republicans had lost the war. The leaders hoped to negotiate an end to hostilities with the rebel forces led by General Francisco Franco. Franco insisted on unconditional surrender, and on 26 March 1939 launched the final offensive of the Spanish Civil War. By the end of the month he controlled the whole country. Most of the council members escaped into exile on British warships."
