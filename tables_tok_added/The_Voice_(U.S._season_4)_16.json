  "intro": "The fourth season of the American reality talent show The Voice premiered on March 25, 2013, on NBC and was hosted by Carson Daly, while Christina Milian returned as the social media correspondent. Coaches Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton returned as coaches, both for their fourth season. Ceelo Green and Christina Aguilera appeared as performers instead of coaches. Two new coaches Shakira and Usher served as replacement coaches for Aguilera and Green, leaving Levine & Shelton the only coaches remaining from the inaugural season. The team sizes were trimmed back down to 12 per team (season two's team size), with each coach having two 'steals' in the Battle Rounds. Danielle Bradbery, a 16-year-old country singer from Houston won the season. She was the youngest winner at the time and this marked Blake Shelton's third win as a coach."
