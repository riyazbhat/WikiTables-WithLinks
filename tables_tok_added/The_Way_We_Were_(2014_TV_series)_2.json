  "intro": "The Way We Were () also known as 16 Summers is a 2014 Taiwanese romance drama produced by Ruby Lin and Lisa Tan (Lin's agent) and directed by Fu-Hsiang Hsu (\u8a31\u5bcc\u7fd4). It stars Lin, Weber Yang, Ann Hsu, Melvin Sia and Jason Tsou (\u9112\u627f\u6069) as five friends who met in college in late-1990s Taipei. The series narrates a love and friendship story that spans 16 years, from the summer of 1998 to 2014. It is set against major events that occurred in Taiwan during the 16 summers, such as the 729 blackout, 921 earthquake, SARS and the Financial crisis of 2007-08. According to online statistics collected by the website dailyview.tw, it was the most popular Taiwanese idol dramas in 2014. Another website 7headlines.com ranked it the second most popular Taiwanese drama of 2014, after In a Good Way (which began broadcasting in 2013 and was therefore not included in dailyview.tw's ranking). Google ranked it the second most-searched TV series in Taiwan in 2014, after the Korean drama Empress Ki. At the 50th Golden Bell Awards, the series won three out of seven nominations, including Best Television Series, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress for Ann Hsu."
