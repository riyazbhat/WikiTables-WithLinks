  "intro": "The 1988 Wales rugby union tour of New Zealand was a series of rugby union games undertaken by the Wales national rugby union team to New Zealand. The tour consisted of six matches against regional teams and two Tests against New Zealand. The tour was not a success for Wales, losing both Tests by heavy scores, and only winning two of the six matches against regional teams. The itinerary was a hard one and New Zealand coach Alex Wyllie stated that he would not have accepted a similar fixture list for his team. The team suffered badly from injuries and had to add six extra players during the course of the tour. Original tour captain Bleddyn Bowen broke his wrist in the second game and was replaced as skipper by Bob Norster, until he suffered a badly gashed knee, whereupon Jonathan Davies took over the captaincy."
