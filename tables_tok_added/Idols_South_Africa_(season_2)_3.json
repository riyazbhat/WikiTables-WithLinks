  "intro": "Idols South Africa II was the third season of South African reality interactive talent show based on the British talent show Pop Idol. It was aired from June 2003, exactly one year after the first season ended, to October of the same year. With Colin Moss and Letoya Makhene new hosts were introduced and half of the juding panel was replaced as Mara Louw and Gareth Cliff replaced Penny Lebyane and Marcus Brewster. The number of finalists was increased to 12 but only two male contestants made it through the semifinal group of the top 32: Jacques Terre'Blanche and Wafeeq Saffodien who both eventually managed to reach the top 5. Originally chosen as a wildcard winner, Francisca Blasisch suddenly quit and was replaced by Khwezi Kekana in the top 12 where she was voted off in the first liveshow. Due to technical issues the voting was voided in the week of 28 September were the contestants where singing songs by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and nobody was sent home that week. On 20 October 2003 Anke Pietrangeli, who was nicknamed The Kimberley Diamond by her supporters, won over fellow-finalist Poseletso Sejosingoe in the Gold Reef City Hippodrome Theatre."
