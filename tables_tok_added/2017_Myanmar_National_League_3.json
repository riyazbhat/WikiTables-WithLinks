  "intro": "The 2017 Myanmar National League, also known as the 2017 Max Cement Myanmar National League, is the 8th season of the Myanmar National League, the top Burmese professional league for association football clubs since its founding in 2009. The nation's highest professional football league was shaken up at the end of the 2016 season following a series of surprise announcements by MNL-1 teams Zwegapin United and Zeyar Shwe Myay stating that they were going to drop out of the League in the next season. Also, Manaw Myay announced the team would be disbanded, despite winning promotion to Myanmars premier domestic league by finishing the season's MNL-2 from the first place. A committee meeting between the Myanmar Football Federation and Myanmar National League officials held in Yangon on September 10 decided to reverse Southern Myanmar's relegation to MNL-2 in the next season, while Nay Pyi Taw received a surprise promotion into the first-tier league. Facing the loss of three squads and fears of scheduling complications for an 11-team league, MFF officials resolved to allow Southern Myanmar to remain in MNL-1, despite an 11th-place finish with only 14 points in the 2016 season. MNL-2 second-place finishers G.F.A, as well as third-place Nay Pyi Taw, were also promoted to the top league to maintain a 12-team schedule. Although Zwegapin United initially signalled their intention to drop out of contention on August 22, team owner U Hla Htay later reversed his decision and announced that his team would continue to compete in the MNL-1, with preparations under progress for a home stadium in Hpa-An. In May 2017, Max Cement company sponsored 2017 MNL for second-half season."
