  "intro": "John Kellogg Hodgman (born June 3, 1971) is an American author, actor, and humorist. In addition to his published written works, such as The Areas of My Expertise, More Information Than You Require, and That Is All, he is known for his personification of a PC in contrast to Justin Long's personification of a Mac in Apple's Get a Mac advertising campaign, and for his work as a contributor on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. His writings have been published in One Story (to which he contributed the debut story Villanova), The Paris Review, McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, Wired and The New York Times Magazine, for which he is editor of the humor section. He contributes to This American Life, and CBC Radio Ones Wiretap. His first book and accompanying audio narration, The Areas of My Expertise, a satirical tongue-in-cheek almanac that contains almost no factual information, was published in 2005. His second book, More Information Than You Require, went on sale October 21, 2008. His third book, That Is All, went on sale November 1, 2011. Vacationland: True Stories from Painful Beaches, a collection of real life wanderings about Hodgman's life experiences (especially in Western Massachusetts and coastal Maine) was published on October 24, 2017. Vacationland was a finalist for the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor. His new book, Medallion Status was released on October 17, 2019. Hodgman was the headline speaker at the 2009 Radio and Television Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington, D.C."
