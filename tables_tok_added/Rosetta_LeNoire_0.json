  "intro": "Rosetta LeNoire (born Rosetta Olive Burton; August 8, 1911 - March 17, 2002) was an American stage, screen, and television actress, as well as a Broadway producer and casting agent. LeNoire is known to contemporary audiences for her work in television. She had regular roles on the series Gimme a Break! and Amen, but is perhaps best known for her role as Estelle Mother Winslow (Carl's mother) on Family Matters, which ran from 1989 to 1998. In 1999, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts."
