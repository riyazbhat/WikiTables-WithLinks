  "intro": "The 2005-06 Irish Cup was the 126th edition of Northern Ireland's premier football knock-out cup competition. It concluded on 6 May 2006 with the final. Portadown were the defending champions, winning their 3rd Irish Cup last season after a 5-1 win over Larne in the 2005 final. This season Portadown reached the quarter-finals, but were defeated by Glentoran. Linfield went on to lift the cup for the 37th time, defeating archrivals Glentoran 2-1 in the final. This was the 15th and to date, last time that both clubs have met in the final."
