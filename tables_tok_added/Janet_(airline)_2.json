  "section_title": "Fleet",
  "section_text": "The first flights from Las Vegas to Area 51 were performed in 1972 by a Douglas DC-6 operated by EG & G . A second Douglas DC-6 was added in 1976 and this type remained in use until 1981 . [ 7 ] As of mid-2015 , the Janet fleet [ 18 ] consists of six Boeing 737-600s painted white with a prominent red cheatline . The fleet is registered to the Department of the Air Force , while some earlier aircraft were registered to several civil aircraft leasing corporations . [ 7 ] Before the arrival of the 737-600s , Janet operated Boeing 737-200s , some of which were modified from military T-43A aircraft . One of the 737-200s with registration N5177C in the 1980s was briefly based in Germany at Frankfurt International Airport ( which was at the time also home to a USAF base , Rhein-Main Air Base ) , and operated by Keyway Air Transport , apparently a front company for a US government operation . It was retired on 6 March 2009 . [ 7 ] Together with the other 737-200s , it was sent to AMARG at Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona for storage . [ 19 ] All Janet 737-600 aircraft are ex-Air China and with the exception of N273RH and N365SR which were previously operated by the now defunct China Southwest Airlines before being acquired for US Air Force operations starting in 2008 . The aircraft were initially taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base before being transferred to Las Vegas . [ 20 ] One aircraft , a Beechcraft 1900 , was lost on 16 March 2004 , when it crashed on approach for Tonopah Test Range Airport after the pilot suffered sudden cardiac arrest . Five people , including the pilot , were killed in the accident . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The aircraft livery is similar to that of the defunct Western Airlines . [ 23 ]",
  "uid": "Janet_(airline)_2",
  "intro": "Janet, sometimes called Janet Airlines, is the unofficial name given to a highly classified fleet of passenger aircraft operated for the United States Department of the Air Force as an employee shuttle to transport military and contractor employees. The purpose is to pick up the employees at their home airport, and take them to their place of work. Then, in the afternoon, they take the employees back to their home airports. The airline mainly serves the Nevada National Security Site (most notably Area 51 and the Tonopah Test Range), from a private terminal at Las Vegas's McCarran International Airport. The airline's aircraft are generally unmarked, but do have a red paint strip along the windows of the aircraft, which gives some sort of hint at Janet being the operator."
