  "intro": "The 2016-17 season was Stoke City's ninth season in the Premier League and the 61st in the top tier of English football. Following last season's third-straight ninth-place finish, Mark Hughes brought in Joe Allen, Wilfried Bony, Lee Grant, Bruno Martins Indi and Ramadan Sobhi. However, Stoke's poor form at the end of last season continued at the start of 2016-17 as in the first six matches they managed to pick up just two points, conceding 15 goals, which meant they ended September in the relegation zone. Following a 1-1 draw at Manchester United at the start of October, Stoke's form picked up and with wins against Sunderland, Hull City, Swansea City, Watford and Burnley the team climbed back into a mid-table position come December. The team's form dropped off again around Christmas conceding three at Arsenal and four at Liverpool and Chelsea whilst home matches against Southampton and Leicester City ended in draws. In January 2017 Hughes brought in long-term transfer target Saido Berahino whilst allowing Bojan to leave on loan. Performances in 2017 were disappointing as Stoke won just six of the remaining 19 Premier League matches, whilst also making an early FA Cup exit. Stoke earned 44 points and finished in 13th position."
