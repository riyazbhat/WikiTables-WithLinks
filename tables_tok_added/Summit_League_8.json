  "intro": "The Summit League, or The Summit, is an NCAA Division I intercollegiate athletic conference with its membership mostly located in the Midwestern United States from Indiana and Illinois on the East of the Mississippi River to the Dakotas and Nebraska on the West, with additional members in the Western state of Colorado and the Southern state of Oklahoma. Founded as the Association of Mid-Continent Universities in 1982, it was rebranded as the Mid-Continent Conference in 1989. On June 1, 2007, the conference changed its name from the Mid-Continent Conference. League headquarters are in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The membership currently consists of nine full members plus four associate members. In July 2020, the University of Missouri-Kansas City will return as a full member after a seven-year absence with the new athletic identity of the Kansas City Roos, while Purdue University Fort Wayne will leave for the Horizon League. A total of 31 schools have been full members, but the only charter member remaining in the league today is Western Illinois University."
