  "section_title": "Education",
  "section_text": "The proposed Harit Pradesh has a long tradition of education , although historically it was primarily confined to the elite class and religious schools . Sanskrit-based learning formed the major part of education from the Vedic to the Gupta periods . As cultures traveled through the region they brought their bodies of knowledge with them , adding Pali , Persian , and Arabic scholarship to the community . These formed the core of Hindu-Buddhist-Muslim education until the rise of British colonialism . The present schools-to-university system of education owes its inception and development in the state ( as in the rest of the country ) to foreign Christian missionaries and the British colonial administration . Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts . Hindi is used as a medium of instruction in most of the schools except those affiliated to the CBSE or the Council for ICSE boards . Under the 10+2+3 plan , after completing secondary school , students typically enroll for 2 years in a junior college , also known as pre-university , or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education or a central board . Students choose from one of three streams , namely liberal arts , commerce , or science . Upon completing the required coursework , students may enroll in general or professional degree programs .",

  "intro": "Harit Pradesh (also known as Pashchim Pradesh & Pashchimanchal) is a proposed new state of India comprising the western parts of Uttar Pradesh state. Harit means Green which signifies the agricultural prosperity of the region and Pradesh means state. The region has some demographic, economic and cultural patterns that are distinct from other parts of Uttar Pradesh, and more closely resemble those of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan states. Jats, Punjabis and Gujjars are the dominant communities here."
