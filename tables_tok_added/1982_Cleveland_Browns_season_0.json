  "intro": "The 1982 Cleveland Browns season was the team's 33rd season with the National Football League. The Browns were among 8 teams that qualified for the playoffs during this strike shorted season, and became one of only four teams to ever qualify for the playoffs despite having a losing record. Browns and the Detroit Lions from the same year are the only two teams with a losing record to qualify as wildcards. In 2010, the Seattle Seahawks became the third team with a losing record to qualify for the playoffs and the first team to win a division title with a losing record (however, the Seahawks were the first to accomplish the former in a non-strike shortened season), followed by the Carolina Panthers four years later. In 1982, the Los Angeles Raiders eliminated the Browns from the playoffs for a second consecutive season, 27-10. The Browns' first round draft pick, rookie sensation linebacker Chip Banks earned 6.5 sacks in just nine games."
