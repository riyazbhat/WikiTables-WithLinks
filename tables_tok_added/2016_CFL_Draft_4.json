  "intro": "The 2016 CFL Draft took place on Tuesday, May 10, 2016 at 7:00 PM ET on TSN2 and RDS2. 70 players were chosen from among eligible players from Canadian Universities across the country, as well as Canadian players playing in the NCAA. The draft was expanded to eight rounds, which is the most since there were eight rounds in the 1992 CFL Draft. This draft also featured the most draft selections since 1987 when 72 players were drafted. The entity which owns both TSN2 and RDS2 showed the first round of the draft on its cable TV platforms with subsequent rounds streamed on TSN GO online. The English language cable channel TSN2 featured host Farhan Lalji and the CFL on TSN panel including Duane Forde, Gary Lawless, Chris Schultz, and Lee Barrette who were chosen to analyze the teams' needs and picks while the French language channel RDS2 featured host Matthieu Proulx alongside analysts, Bruno Heppell, Didier Orm\u00e9juste and Pierre Vercheval."
