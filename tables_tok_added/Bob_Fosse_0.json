  "intro": "Robert Louis Fosse (June 23, 1927 - September 23, 1987) was an American dancer, musical-theatre choreographer, actor and theatre and film director. He directed and choreographed musical works on stage and screen, including the stage musicals The Pajama Game (choreography) in 1954 and Chicago in 1975 and the film Cabaret in 1972. Fosse's distinctive style of choreography included turned-in knees and jazz hands. He is the only person ever to have won Oscar, Emmy, and Tony awards in the same year (1973). He was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Best Director for Cabaret, and won a record eight Tonys for his choreography, as well as one for direction for Pippin."
