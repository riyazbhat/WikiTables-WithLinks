  "intro": "BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend (previously known as One Big Weekend, for 2012 as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, and for 2018 as BBC Music's Biggest Weekend) is a music festival run by BBC Radio 1. It is held once a year, in a different location within the United Kingdom each time. It was previously the biggest free ticketed music event in Europe, until a fee for tickets was introduced in 2018, and always includes a host of new artists. The festival is a spin-off of Radio 1's One Big Sunday, where in each Sunday during July and August, a different town would host the roadshow, usually next to a beach or in a large park. These were also free, but non-ticketed. Both the One Big Sunday and One Big Weekend events are successors to the Radio 1 Roadshow which toured the country during every summer from 1973 until the 1990s. Originally a One Big Weekend would run twice a year. Saturday was dedicated to dance music and Sunday to bands. Since 2005, the dance day has been replaced by a second day of bands. In 2005, the dance music took place on a second stage on the Saturday only and in 2006 it took place off site at a club on the Saturday night. The Saturday of dance music was effectively reinstated for the 2013 event in Northern Ireland, but with the day of electronic dance being held on the Friday of the weekend. The Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, with a crowd capacity of 50,000."
