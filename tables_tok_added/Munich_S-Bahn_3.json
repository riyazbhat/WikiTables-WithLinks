  "section_title": "History -- Plans , with the Munich Olympic bid",
  "section_text": "In 1965 , the Federal Republic of Germany , the Free State of Bavaria , the state capital of Munich and the Deutsche Bundesbahn signed a contract on the construction of the Munich S-Bahn . The further development was most influenced by a decision made in Rome on 26 April 1966 : the International Olympic Committee chose Munich over Detroit , Madrid and Montreal as the location for the 1972 Summer Olympics , resulting in a tight schedule of only six years to complete the Munich S-Bahn network .",

  "intro": "The Munich S-Bahn () is an electric rail transit system in Munich, Germany. S-Bahn is the German abbreviation for Stadtschnellbahn (literally, urban rapid rail), and the Munich S-Bahn exhibits characteristics of both rapid transit and commuter rail systems. The Munich S-Bahn network is operated by S-Bahn M\u00fcnchen, a subsidiary of DB Regio Bayern that is itself a subsidiary of the German national railway. It is integrated into the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (M\u00fcnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund, MVV) and interconnected throughout the city with the locally owned Munich U-Bahn. Today, the S-Bahn covers most of the populated area of the Munich Metropolitan area of about 2.7 million inhabitants. The Munich S-Bahn was established on 28 May 1972. It was intended as part of the scheme to provide an adequate transport system during the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich by connecting the pre-existing suburban rail services in the west and east of the city via a new tunnel section from Hauptbahnhof to M\u00fcnchen Ost station (Ostbahnhof)."
