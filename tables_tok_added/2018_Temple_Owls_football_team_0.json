  "intro": "The 2018 Temple Owls football team represents Temple University in the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Owls were led by second-year head coach Geoff Collins during the regular season and play their home games at Lincoln Financial Field. They are members of the East Division of the American Athletic Conference. They finished the season 8-5, 7-1 in AAC play to finish in 2nd place in the East Division. They were invited to play in the Independence Bowl, where they lost to Duke. On December 7, 2018, head coach Geoff Collins left for the head coaching job at Georgia Tech. Tight ends coach Ed Foley led the Owls in the Independence Bowl. On December 13, the Owls initially named Miami defensive coordinator Manny Diaz as their new head coach. However, on December 30, Diaz went back to Miami to become their new head coach following Mark Richt's sudden retirement."
