  "section_text": "Scion is a role-playing game wherein players take on the roles of mortal descendants of gods tasked with working as the hands of their parents in the mortal world ; while the first edition focused on a singular antagonist in the form of the recently escaped Titans ( powerful , primordial embodiments of concepts such as water , chaos or light ) , the second edition does not automatically place this at the forefront . The pantheons presented draw from mythology across the world , giving players the ability to associate their characters with any of the pantheons presented in the game . Portrayals of the gods differ between editions , ranging from a minor renaming ( e.g . the Greek Gods no longer being listed as the `` Dodekatheoi '' but as simply the `` Theoi '' ) to full-fledged reimagining ( The African Loa of first edition are now presented in their pre-syncretic forms as the Yoruban Orisha ) .",
