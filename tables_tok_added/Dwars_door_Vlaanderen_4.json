  "intro": "Dwars door Vlaanderen () is a semi-classic road bicycle race in Belgium, held annually since 1945. The race starts in Roeselare and finishes in Waregem, both in West Flanders. Since 2017 the event is included in the UCI World Tour. Held in late March, the event is part of the Flemish Cycling Week, which also includes E3 Harelbeke, Gent-Wevelgem and the Tour of Flanders. Traditionally Dwars door Vlaanderen was held four days after Milan-San Remo and a week and a half before the Tour of Flanders. As from 2018 the race moved up one week on the international calendar and is now contested on the Wednesday before the Tour of Flanders, Flanders' foremost cycling classic, held on Sunday. Since 2012, a women's edition of Dwars door Vlaanderen is held on the same day as the men's race, starting and finishing on the same location, of approximately 130 kilometres distance. Both events are organized by Flanders Classics. In addition the Grand Prix de Waregem was formerly regarded as the Under 23 version of the race."
