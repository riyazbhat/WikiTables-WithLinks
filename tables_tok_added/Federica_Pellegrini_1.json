  "intro": "Federica Pellegrini (Italian pronunciation: [fede\u02c8ri\u02d0ka pelle\u02c8\u0261ri\u02d0ni]; born 5 August 1988) is an Italian swimmer. A native of Mirano, in the province of Venice, she holds the women's 200 m freestyle world record (long course), and won a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Pellegrini became the first woman ever to break the 4 minute barrier in the 400 m freestyle with a time of 3:59.15. Pellegrini is the only swimmer \u2212 male or female \u2212 to have won eight medals in a row in the same event (200 meters freestyle) at the World Championships. She is also the first female Olympic champion in the history of Italian swimming and the only Italian swimmer to have set world records in more than one event."
