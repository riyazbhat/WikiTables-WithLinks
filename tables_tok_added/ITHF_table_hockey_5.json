  "intro": "Table hockey is a sport played on table hockey games. The International Table Hockey Federation (ITHF) uses only table hockeys made by Stiga. The origin of the sport was the Swedish Championship 1982 in Upplands V\u00e4sby. Organized table hockey is played in northern, central and eastern Europe, in North America, but table hockey is also played in South America, Africa, Australia, and Asia. The World Championship is organized by the ITHF every two years. The Stiga Play Off game is the official game of the Table Hockey World Championship. Sweden has dominated the table hockey scene from the beginning and a couple of years into the new millennium. Until the Finnish gold in Riga 2005, Sweden had won all Team World Championships, until 2006 only Swedes had won the Open Swedish Masters, and until 2007 all individual world champions were Swedes. But the new generation comes from Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Latvia, Canada, Denmark, USA, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia and Lithuania, and its current big star is Maxim Borisov from Russia who is the reigning World and European champion. Borisov has been ranked #1 in the world since December 2013. Since the sport expands quickly in many countries, the table hockey map may have to be redrawn within a couple of years when nations other than the big seven (Sweden, Finland, Russia, Czech Republic, Norway, Latvia and Ukraine) produce new talents."
