  "intro": "Sunny () is a 2011 South Korean comedy-drama film. The film is about a middle-aged woman who tries to fulfill her friend's dying wish of reuniting their group of high school friends. The film alternates between two timelines: the present day where the women are middle-aged, and the 1980s when they were in high school. It is the second film by writer-director Kang Hyeong-cheol, who previously directed Scandal Makers (2008). Released on 4 May 2011, Sunny was the first film of that year to sell five million tickets in South Korea, and became the second highest grossing Korean film by year's end. , it is the all-time 13th best-selling in South Korean history. Kang Hyeong-cheol and Nam Na-yeong won Best Director and Best Editing, respectively, at the Grand Bell Awards. Actress Kang So-ra won several awards for her role as the teenage Ha Chun-hwa."
