          "Arguably the most powerful villain the team has ever encountered , Red Jack was an extra-dimensional being , with a filigree crown and a masquerade-style mask , dressed in mid 17th century nobleman costume , who claimed to be both Jack the Ripper , and the creator of the universe . His powers derived from the collective suffering of millions of butterflies , which he kept pinned to the wall of his home . He kidnapped Rhea Jones ( AKA Lodestone ) from the hospital where she was being tended to during a coma , in order to make her his bride . Upon discovering Rhea missing from her hospital bed , Crazy Jane reveals the identity of her kidnapper through a divining ritual involving cut up pieces from books she stole from a store down the street ( a method purportedly used by Dadaists and William S. Burroughs to create random poetry ) . Red Jack easily defeats the Doom Patrol , and seems unstoppable until Crazy Jane releases his butterfly collection , rendering him powerless , and allowing a suddenly-awakened Rhea Jones to stab him in the back with his own knife"
