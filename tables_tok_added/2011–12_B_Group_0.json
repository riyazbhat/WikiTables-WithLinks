  "intro": "The 2011-12 B Group was the 57th season of the Bulgarian B Football Group, the second tier of the Bulgarian football league system. The season started on 13 August 2011 and finished in June 2012 with the A Group promotion play-off. On 9 June the Executive Committee of Bulgarian Football Union decided to reduce further the number of teams in both West and East B PFG due licensing problems in most of the clubs. The new format consisted of ten teams in each group playing three times against all the others during the season. There were no draws for the matches between fixture 19 and fixture 27. The program was issued depending the position of each club after the completion of fixture 18. Like in the previous season, the A Group promotion play-off was played in two stages. The first was the match between the runners-up from the West and East B PFG. The final stage was played between the 14th finished team from A Group and the winner from the first stage."
