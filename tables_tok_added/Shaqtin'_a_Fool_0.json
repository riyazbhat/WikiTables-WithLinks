  "section_title": "Special Editions -- Shaqtin ' a Fool Midseason Award Special",
  "section_text": "On February 27 , 2014 , a midseason special named the `` Shaqtin 's '' ( parodying the Academy Awards ) aired on NBA TV featuring O'Neal , Scott and Greenberg . [ 8 ]",
  "uid": "Shaqtin'_a_Fool_0",
  "intro": "Shaqtin' a Fool is a weekly segment from the television show Inside the NBA, the postgame show of NBA on TNT following the conclusion of National Basketball Association (NBA) games airing on cable TV channel TNT. The title is a play on actin' a fool. It first aired during the 2011-12 NBA season, when retired NBA All-Star Shaquille O'Neal voiced it upon joining the show and was created by Turner Sports producer Mike Goldfarb. It highlights humorous and uncommon basketball plays that have occurred during NBA games in the past week. O'Neal is the host and presenter, while the other analysts in studio react and provide commentary. Most often, those have been fellow Inside regulars Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley, but other Inside hosts have also participated, including Chris Webber, Grant Hill, Steve Smith, Kevin Garnett and Matt Winer. The segment regularly features NBA players and also includes, but is not limited to, coaches, referees, fans, mascots, and other arena employees. Sometimes they also air clips from other international basketball leagues. On special occasions, the segment features plays which had occurred during the past, including several entire retro editions. Each episode tends to have five entries from the past week, with each entry typically involving a single play (although there are some times where a collection of similar bad plays, such as travels and air ball free throws, are highlighted). Multiple plays may include the same player, and a single play may highlight more than one player. There is a special award given to certain players, called the Shaqtin Golden Ticket, which is lifetime immunity from being included in the segment."
