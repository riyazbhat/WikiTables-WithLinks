  "intro": "Crashed Ice (full official name: Red Bull Crashed Ice) is a world tour in the winter extreme sporting event, ice cross downhill (or downhill ice cross), which involves downhill skating in an urban environment, on a track which includes steep turns and high vertical drops. The series was created and is managed by energy drinks company Red Bull. It is similar to ski cross and snowboard cross, except with ice skates on an ice track, instead of skis or snowboards on a snow track. Competitors, having advanced from one of the tryouts in the prior months, race in heats of four skaters, with the top two advancing from each heat. Racers, typically ice hockey players (however, the seven times single event winner Jasper Felder was a bandy player, who in that sport represented the United States, while in ice cross dowhill represented Sweden), outfitted as such, speed down the courses turns, berms, and jumps."
