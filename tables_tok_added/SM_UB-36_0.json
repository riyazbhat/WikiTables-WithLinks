  "intro": "SM UB-36 was a German Type UB II submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The U-boat was ordered on 22 July 1915 and launched on 15 January 1916. She was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 22 May 1916 as SM UB-36. The submarine sank seven ships in twelve patrols. She herself was sunk in May 1917, but her fate is a matter of dispute. Some sources claim that UB-36 was rammed and presumably sunk by the French steamer in the English Channel off Ushant, France, on 21 May 1917. Other sources states that this in fact was and that UB-36 struck a mine and sank elsewhere."
