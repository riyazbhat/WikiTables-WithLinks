  "intro": "The Slovenian Futsal Cup, currently named Futsal Cup Terme Olimia due to the sponsorship reasons, is the top knockout tournament of Slovenian futsal and the second most important futsal competition in Slovenia after the Slovenian Futsal League. It is organized by the Football Association of Slovenia and was established in the 1995-96 season. The cup is contested by 16 clubs: eight top ranked teams in the Slovenian Futsal League (SFL) and eight winners of the regional cups organised by the Intercommunal football associations. The games are played in a single leg knock-out format, with the exception of quarter-final which is played over two legs. Since 2013, Pod\u010detrtek is hosting the final tournament of the competition (semi-final and final). The most successful team in the history of the competition is Litija who have triumphed nine times. They are followed by Oplast Kobarid and Puntar, who have won three titles each. Luvin and Brezje, both from Maribor, and Dobovec have won two titles each, while Celje, Gorica, and Bronx \u0160kofije have won one title each."
