  "intro": "The second season of the Romanian reality talent show Vocea Rom\u00e2niei premiered on ProTV on September 25, 2012. It was hosted by Pavel Barto\u0219 and Nicoleta Luciu, while Vlad Ro\u0219ca was the social media correspondent. All four coaches returned for their second season. The season expanded from the first season: each coach had fourteen artists on their team, rather than twelve as in the first season, resulting in 24 contestants qualifying for the live shows, as opposed to 20 the previous year. The blind auditions have also been extended from five to six episodes. The pre-selection phase was extended to more locations across Romania; they were held June 4 to June 29, 2012, in Bucharest, Ia\u0219i, Constan\u021ba, Timi\u0219oara and Cluj-Napoca. The season finale aired on December 26, 2012. Julie Mayaya, mentored by coach Horia Brenciu, was declared winner of the season. It was Brenciu's first victory as a coach."
