  "section_title": "The Act",
  "section_text": "The Act established , from 1 April 1996 , twenty-two new unitary authority areas , to be known as 'counties ' or 'county boroughs ' , and abolished the eight local government counties and 37 districts that had been formed in 1974 . `` Preserved counties '' , based on the previous local government counties as established in 1974 , were created for the purposes of lieutenancy and shrievality . Each new unitary authority area was to have an elected council and be divided into electoral districts , each returning one councillor . The entire council of each area was to be elected every four years , with the first election in 1995 . Section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972 allowed local government districts to petition the Privy Council in order acquire borough status . As the 1994 Act abolished the districts in Wales it inserted a section 245A in the 1972 Act to allow the new unitary authority areas which did not have the status of a borough to acquire it . As the only unitary authority areas that are not already styled as 'boroughs ' are styled as 'counties ' , this leads to the curious provision that a council can petition for its county to become a county borough . The Secretary of State was empowered to direct a council to make a decentralisation scheme , with area committees being formed of all the councillors for a specified area . This provision has been used to create , for example , area committees for Brecknockshire , Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire in Powys , and the Arfon , Dwyfor and Meirionnydd in Gwynedd . Schedule 1 listed the new counties and county boroughs : Counties English name Welsh name Area Anglesey Sir F\u00f4n The district of Ynys M\u00f4n \u2013 Isle of Anglesey .
