  "intro": "Denmark participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song The Way You Are, written by Remee and Chief 1. The song was performed by the band Anti Social Media. In February 2015, Danish broadcaster DR organised the national final Melodi Grand Prix 2015 in order to select the Danish entry for the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna, Austria. Anti Social Media and the song The Way You Are emerged as the winner following the 50/50 combination of jury voting and televoting. In the first of the Eurovision semi-finals, Denmark failed to qualify to the final, placing thirteenth out of the 16 participating countries with 33 points."
