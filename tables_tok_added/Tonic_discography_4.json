  "intro": "The discography of Tonic, an American rock band, consists of five studio albums, one live album, one compilation album, six singles, and six music videos. Tonic was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1993. After signing a recording contract in 1995, the band released its first album in 1996, titled Lemon Parade. Based on the success of the single If You Could Only See, Lemon Parade sold 1,300,000 copies. Tonic also contributed songs to original soundtracks in the late 1990s, such as the song Flower Man for . Continuing to tour extensively, the band released an album of live songs entitled Live and Enhanced, which also featured extra content, such as the music video for the song Soldier's Daughter. Tonic self-produced their second studio album Sugar in 1999, from which the song You Wanted More came to be the lead single from the American Pie movie soundtrack. Their third studio album, 2002's Head on Straight, charted on the Billboard 200 for one week, yet the band was nominated for two Grammy awards related to the album. After the band ended a four-year hiatus in 2008, the greatest hits compilation was released in 2009. The greatest hits compilation served as a prelude to their fourth studio album, 2010's Tonic."
