  "intro": "The 2008 Green Bay Packers season was the franchise's 90th season overall and their 88th in the National Football League, and the 3rd under head coach Mike McCarthy. They looked to continue success after posting a 13-3 record in 2007, but they failed to do so and finished the season with a losing 6-10 record. Until the 2017 season, this was the last season in which the Packers did not qualify for the playoffs. It was the first season since 1991 that quarterback Brett Favre was not on the team's roster. Favre retired in March, decided to come back over the summer and was ultimately traded to the New York Jets after the team told Favre playing in Green Bay again was not an option. It was the first season with quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the team's starter."
