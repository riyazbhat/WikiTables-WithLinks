  "section_text": "Any prism over a regular polygon with an even number of sides forms a zonohedron . These prisms can be formed so that all faces are regular : two opposite faces are equal to the regular polygon from which the prism was formed , and these are connected by a sequence of square faces . Zonohedra of this type are the cube , hexagonal prism , octagonal prism , decagonal prism , dodecagonal prism , etc . In addition to this infinite family of regular-faced zonohedra , there are three Archimedean solids , all omnitruncations of the regular forms : The truncated octahedron , with 6 square and 8 hexagonal faces . ( Omnitruncated tetrahedron ) The truncated cuboctahedron , with 12 squares , 8 hexagons , and 6 octagons . ( Omnitruncated cube ) The truncated icosidodecahedron , with 30 squares , 20 hexagons and 12 decagons . ( Omnitruncated dodecahedron ) In addition , certain Catalan solids ( duals of Archimedean solids ) are again zonohedra : Kepler 's rhombic dodecahedron is the dual of the cuboctahedron . The rhombic triacontahedron is the dual of the icosidodecahedron . Others with congruent rhombic faces : Bilinski 's rhombic dodecahedron . Rhombic icosahedron Rhombohedron There are infinitely many zonohedra with rhombic faces that are not all congruent to each other . They include : Rhombic enneacontahedron",

  "intro": "A zonohedron is a convex polyhedron with point symmetry, every face of which is a polygon with point symmetry. Any zonohedron may equivalently be described as the Minkowski sum of a set of line segments in three-dimensional space, or as the three-dimensional projection of a hypercube. Zonohedra were originally defined and studied by E. S. Fedorov, a Russian crystallographer. More generally, in any dimension, the Minkowski sum of line segments forms a polytope known as a zonotope."
