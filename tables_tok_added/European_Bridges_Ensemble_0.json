  "intro": "The European Bridges Ensemble (EBE) was established for Internet and network music performance. Its current members are the five performers Kai Niggemann (M\u00fcnster, Germany), \u00c1d\u00e1m Siska (Budapest, Hungary), Johannes Kretz (Vienna, Austria), Andrea Szigetv\u00e1ri (Dunakeszi, Hungary), Ivana Ognjanovi\u0107 (Belgrade, Serbia), the conductor and software designer Georg Hajdu (Hamburg, Germany), and video artist Stewart Collinson (Lincoln, England). Using the term bridges as a metaphor, the Ensemble attempts to bridge cultures, regions, locations and individuals, each with their specific history. Particularly, Europe with its historical and ethnic diversity has repeatedly gone through massive changes separating and reuniting people often living in close vicinity. The aim is to further explore the potential of taking participating musicians and artists out of their political and social isolation by creating virtual communities of like-minded artists united by their creativity and mutual interests. The first Bridges concert on 17 June 2005 (simultaneously in M\u00fcnster, Stuttgart and Vienna) brought together musicians from the former West (Austria and Germany) and East (Hungary and Serbia) - all connected by the river Danube - and thus demonstrated the potential of Internet performance as a means to overcome national borders and political single-mindedness."
