  "intro": "The 1971 Tour de France was the 58th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 26 June and 18 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of . In 1971 only three other riders were able to stay within 20:00 of the overpowering Eddy Merckx. Once again it was Joop Zoetemelk finishing second, the only rider to finish inside +10:00 of the rider who was becoming known as 'The Cannibal', however, this was a Tour that Merckx nearly lost. This was the third consecutive victory for Merckx, who became just third rider after Louison Bobet and Jacques Anquetil to win three Tours in a row, although it had looked unlikely that he would win after the 11th stage. He ended up more than eight minutes behind Luis Oca\u00f1a in the general classification as Ocana had launched a daring solo attack in which he took the Maillot Jaune from Zoetemelk and considerably distanced himself from the rest of the field including Merckx. But Oca\u00f1a had to retire from the race during the 14th stage after he crashed on the descent of the Col de Ment\u00e9."
