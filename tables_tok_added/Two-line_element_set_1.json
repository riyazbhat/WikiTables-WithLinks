  "section_text": "Originally there were two data formats used with the SGP models , one containing complete details on the object known as the `` internal format '' , and a second known as the `` transmission format '' that was used to provide updates to that data . The internal format used three 80-column punch cards . Each card started with a card number , 1 , 2 or 3 , and ended with the letter `` G '' . For this reason , the system was often known as the `` G-card format '' . In addition to the orbital elements , the G-card included various flags like the launching country and orbit type ( geostationary , etc . ) , calculated values like the perigee altitude and visual magnitude , and a 38-character comments field . The transmission format is essentially a cut-down version of the G-card format , removing any data that is not subject to change on a regular basis , or data that can be calculated using other values . For instance , the perigee altitude from the G-card is not included as this can be calculated from the other elements . What remains is the set of data needed to update the original G-card data as additional measurements are made . The data is fit into 70 columns and does not include a trailing character . TLEs are simply the transmission format data rendered as ASCII text .

  "intro": "A two-line element set (TLE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the epoch. Using suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. The TLE data representation is specific to the simplified perturbations models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest. TLEs can describe the trajectories only of Earth-orbiting objects. TLEs are widely used as input for projecting the future orbital tracks of space debris for purposes of characterizing future debris events to support risk analysis, close approach analysis, collision avoidance maneuvering and forensic analysis. The format was originally intended for punch cards, encoding a set of elements on two standard 80-column cards. This format was eventually replaced by text files with each set of elements written to two 70-column ASCII lines. The United States Air Force tracks all detectable objects in Earth orbit, creating a corresponding TLE for each object, and makes publicly available TLEs for many of the space objects on the website Space Track, holding back or obfuscating data on many military or classified objects. The TLE format is a de facto standard for distribution of an Earth-orbiting object's orbital elements. A TLE set may include a title line preceding the element data, so each listing may take up three lines in the file. The title is not required, as each data line includes a unique object identifier code."
