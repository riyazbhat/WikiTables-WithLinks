  "intro": "The 2014 Melbourne Football Club season was the club's 115th year in the VFL/AFL since it began in 1897. On the back of three seasons stemming back to 2011, Melbourne underwent changes to its football department in 2013. The most significant of these changes included the appointment of 2005 premiership coach Paul Roos for two seasons (with an option of a third season). It also saw the temporary appointment of former CEO, Peter Jackson, as Melbourne's new CEO for two seasons and the appointment of former Bernie Naylor Medalist Glen Bartlett as president. Due to Melbourne's on-field performances in recent seasons, Melbourne received a very financially challenging fixture. For the second consecutive season, Melbourne did not receive a Friday night game and were forced to play , , , and twice (none of whom are traditionally large crowd drawers in Melbourne's home games). Melbourne sold two of its home games into the Northern Territory due to a sponsorship deal made with Tourism NT. One was at TIO Traeger Park in Alice Springs in round 11 against Port Adelaide. This will be the first ever AFL game held at this stadium for premiership points as well as the first in Central Australia. The other game was at TIO Stadium in Darwin against in round 16. In addition Melbourne hosted the at Etihad Stadium in round 19 as hosted Port Adelaide at the MCG later that day instead. Despite the financially challenging fixture, Melbourne hosted a handful of blockbuster games, which included Paul Roos coaching against his old side in round 5 for the first time."
