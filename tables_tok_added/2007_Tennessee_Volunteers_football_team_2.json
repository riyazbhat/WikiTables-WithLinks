  "intro": "The 2007 Tennessee Volunteers football team represented the University of Tennessee in the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season. They won the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference before falling to the eventual national champion LSU Tigers in the SEC Championship Game. The Vols capped off the season by defeating the Wisconsin Badgers in the Outback Bowl to finish with a record of 10-4. The team was led by head coach Phillip Fulmer. The Volunteers played their home games at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee. The 2007 season was the last at Tennessee for four assistants on the staff. Offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe left to be head coach at Duke, taking assistants Matt Luke and Kurt Roper with him, while wide receivers coach Trooper Taylor accepted a co-offensive coordinator's position at Oklahoma State."
