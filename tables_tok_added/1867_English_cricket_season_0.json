  "intro": "1867 was the 81st season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Yorkshire achieved a perfect season in first-class cricket, something not likely to be equaled on covered pitches due to the high frequency of drawn matches, and even beforehand much more difficult due to the increased scoring after 1870 produced by the heavy roller and the disappearance of the abundant shooters which previously made batting very tough. The season is, however, best known for a schism between the northern and southern professionals that led to the North v South game, one of the major representative fixtures of the time, being suspended for several years because northern professionals refused to play in London for want of better conditions."
