  "intro": "The 2018 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team represented the University of Notre Dame in the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The team was led by head coach Brian Kelly, who was in his ninth season at Notre Dame, and played its home games at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana. The Fighting Irish competed as an independent. Notre Dame, coming off a 10-3, Citrus Bowl-winning season in 2017, began the year ranked 12th in the AP Poll. In the first game of the year, they hosted rival No. 14 Michigan, in the first game played in the series since 2014. Notre Dame won by a score of 24-17. The Irish continued to roll, and after convincing wins against ranked opponents Stanford and Virginia Tech, rose to third in the polls. Notre Dame finished the regular season with a perfect 12-0 record, and were ranked third in the final College Football Playoff rankings, earning them a spot in the national semifinal to be played at the Cotton Bowl against second-ranked Clemson. The Irish lost to the eventual national champion Tigers by a score of 30-3. Their final record of 12-1 and final ranking of 5th in the nation represented the program's best season since 2012. Quarterback Brandon Wimbush led the offense for the first three games, after which he was benched in favor of Ian Book."
