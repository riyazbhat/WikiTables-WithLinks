          "3-13 July 19 , 2011 Got to Work on a Crab Boat . Kenneth Speedy Raulerson and his gang of criminals rob a bank in Florida . During the heist a teller inserted a booby trap dye pack along with cash which exploded after the crew left the bank and rendered some of the money unusable . Kenneth then decided it was too risky to stay in Florida and fled to Alaska to give him some space from the crime . In Alaska he gets a job working on a crab boat for a season . At this point in the case Florida police decide to involve the Secret Service figuring Ken went on the run to make it easier for him to hide from his crime with this law enforcement agencies throughout the USA are informed and are now on the lookout for him and the stolen stained cash . Ken tried to clean his ink-stained money but he was not successful yet he did get some of the ink off enough for him to think he could pass it and not get anyone the wiser but he was wrong the bank alerted authorities of the stained money making its way back into the Alaskan banking system . The Alaska State Troopers tracked Ken down and questioned him about the dye-stained money being circulated in Alaska and asked for permission to search his house to which he consented . The Troopers initiated the consent search and overlooked the stained used dirty underwear that was against the wall in his trailer where Ken had hidden most of the stained money . After the search Ken explains that any money that was discovered that he spent was from him keeping his cash on a notebook in his pocket and since he worked on a crab boat the money would get wet and the ink in the notebook would leach into the money and showed the troopers some stained money he keep in his little notebook with that the police were satisfied with this they let him go . Now Ken started to get homesick and figured he could go back to Florida and just keep a low profile to avoid the police and also he would be able to see his kids and family . Not long after he arrived back in Florida police informants let the authorities know he was back in town and they should be on the lookout for him but as they found out chasing Ken was like chasing a ghost they would get reports he was here or there and could never catch up to him . Ken stayed free and on the run for around six years before getting caught . One time they were so close he was walking to where he was staying and spotted an officer standing near where he was heading and Ken dropped into an over grown drainage ditch and hid and watched as they captured a man that according to one officer If that is not him that 's his twin brother as Ken watched this unfold he decided to stay put till the arrest squad wrapped up and headed out and to his surprise as they gave up and headed out a few minutes after the observable officers left then a swat sniper dressed in a full ghillie suit stood up less that 20 feet from him in the same ditch and by some good fortune the sniper had not seen him bumble in and drop and hide at the ambush area from there he stayed put and watched the team disembark and then from there Ken crawled away on his hands and knees all the way through the woods even after he was sure they were gone just to be safe . Finally after years of hunting and running down dead lead after dead lead , the police finally got the solid tip that they had been searching so hard to get and found out that Ken was doing landscaping and through an informant they got him word of an easy quick well paying job , cash money that he could not pass up and the police set their trap and he walked right into it with his son . He has clammed that he had a bad feeling and deep down inside he knew it was a trap and if he would have listened to himself he would still be free and on the run but he and his son needed the cash to keep afloat so he went ahead and ignored his gut and let himself walk right into the trap , then at the moment right as he knew his gut was right all along he realizing what he had to do with his sons life at risk he had to do the right thing even though he probable could have made a break for it and out run the police as he has always done before but it was not worth the chance if one of the officers had perceived or had the slightest thought that he was a threat or thought he had a gun then there could be gun fire and he could not risk his sons life no matter how long of a jail sentence he was looking at , he would never risk his son 's life over his , so he knew he had to just surrender without a fight with his hands up he said I 'm the one you want I 'm Kenneth Raulerson , That 's my son do n't shoot , do n't shoot hoping to keep his son from getting shot and hurt or worst killed . Finally law enforcement has their prize , the bank robber was finally caught and will stand trial"

  "intro": "I (Almost) Got Away With It is an American documentary television series on Investigation Discovery, debuting on January 12, 2010. The series profiles true stories of people who have committed crimes, and have avoided arrest or capture, but ultimately end up being caught. Many of these people escaped from prisons after being sentenced while others escaped jails they were being held in while awaiting trial. Sometimes they are on the run as little as a few weeks before being caught while other times they remain on the run for years and in a few cases even decades. While on the run, some of the fugitives do anything from robbing gas stations to stealing Crystal Gayle's tour bus. Many others found a way to build a new life without committing new crimes and successfully remain in hiding for years. The series was created by executive producer David M. Frank of Indigo Films. Most scenes were not filmed in areas that the stories took place. Many outdoor scenes in this series are filmed at the company's studio on Treasure Island in San Francisco, in the middle of San Francisco Bay. Other outdoor scenes were filmed in northern New Jersey. The series has repeated on Discovery Channel and American Heroes Channel (AHC)."
