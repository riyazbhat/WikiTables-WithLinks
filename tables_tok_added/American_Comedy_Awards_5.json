  "intro": "The American Comedy Awards are a group of awards presented annually in the United States recognizing performances and performers in the field of comedy, with an emphasis on television comedy and comedy films. They began in 1987, billed as the first awards show to honor all forms of comedy. In 1989, after the death of Lucille Ball, the statue was named the Lucy to honor the comic legend. In 2001, the last edition for 13 years was presented on Comedy Central. NBC revived the awards in May 2014."
