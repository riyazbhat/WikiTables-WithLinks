  "intro": "Frisco Independent School District is a public school district based in Frisco, Texas, United States. The district covers portions of the cities of Frisco, Little Elm, McKinney, and Plano, as well as unincorporated land in Denton and Collin counties. The district was originally formed in 1876 and known as the Farmers School District. Small schoolhouses served the rural population at that time. The community of Frisco began to emerge in 1902 and the school district was renamed. The district is one of the largest in Texas and the nation. In 1995, Frisco ISD had four schools. Since then, the district has added 64 new schools, opening two to six campuses annually. No public school district in the country grew faster from 1990-1991 to 2010-2011, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The school district earned a met standard rating from the Texas Education Agency in 2016."
