  "intro": "Michigan's 3rd congressional district is a United States Congressional district in Western Michigan. From 2003 to 2013 it consisted of the counties of Barry, Ionia, and all except the northwest portion of Kent. The district was extended to Battle Creek after redistricting in 2012. The district is currently represented by independent Justin Amash, one of the youngest members of the House. He was first elected in the 2010 General Election, and until July 2019, was a member of the Republican Party. Since July 2019, Amash has been the only independent member of the House."
