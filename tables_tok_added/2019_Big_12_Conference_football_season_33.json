  "intro": "The 2019 Big 12 Conference football season represents the 24th season of Big 12 conference football, taking place during the 2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The season began with non-conference play on Thursday, August 29, 2019. Conference play began on Saturday, September 21, 2019. The entire schedule was released on October 18, 2018. The 2019 season is the eighth for the Big 12 since the early-2010s conference realignment brought the Big 12 membership to its current form. As a ten-team league, the Big 12 will play a nine-game round-robin conference schedule and each member will play three non-conference games - one of which must be against a Power Five conference foe. The regular season will be followed by a conference championship game played between the regular-season champion and the regular-season runner-up. The 2019 Big 12 Championship Game will be held at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Saturday, December 7, 2019."
