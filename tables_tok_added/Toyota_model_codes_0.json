  "intro": "Every Toyota vehicle has a model code which describes the basic vehicle (e.g. Corolla), its generation and major options (engine type, gearbox type, body style, grade level). The model codes fall into three periods, 1937 to late 1950s, late 1950s to late 1970s and late 1970s to present. There was some overlap as new models were phased in using new codes while old models were phased out using the old codes. The model code is not the same as the VIN."
