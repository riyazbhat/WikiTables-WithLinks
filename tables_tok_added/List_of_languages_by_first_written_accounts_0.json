  "section_title": "Before 1000 BC",
  "section_text": "Further information : Bronze Age writing Writing first appeared in the Near East at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC . A very limited number of languages are attested in the area from before the Bronze Age collapse and the rise of alphabetic writing : the Sumerian , Hurrian , Hattic and Elamite language isolates , Afro-Asiatic in the form of the Egyptian and Semitic languages and Indo-European ( Anatolian languages and Mycenaean Greek ) . In East Asia towards the end of the second millennium BC , the Sino-Tibetan family was represented by Old Chinese . There are also a number of undeciphered Bronze Age records : Proto-Elamite script and Linear Elamite the Indus script ( claimed to record a `` Harappan language '' ) Cretan hieroglyphs and Linear A ( encoding a possible `` Minoan language '' ) [ 4 ] [ 5 ] the Cypro-Minoan syllabary [ 6 ] Earlier symbols , such as the Jiahu symbols , Vin\u010da symbols and the marks on the Dispilio tablet , are believed to be proto-writing , rather than representations of language .",
  "uid": "List_of_languages_by_first_written_accounts_0",
  "intro": "This is a list of languages arranged by the approximate dates of the oldest existing texts recording a complete sentence in the language. It does not include undeciphered scripts, though there are various claims without wide acceptance, which, if substantiated, would push backward the first attestation of certain languages. It also does not include inscriptions consisting of isolated words or names from a language. In most cases, some form of the language had already been spoken (and even written) considerably earlier than the dates of the earliest extant samples provided here. A written record may encode a stage of a language corresponding to an earlier time, either as a result of oral tradition, or because the earliest source is a copy of an older manuscript that was lost. An oral tradition of epic poetry may typically bridge a few centuries, and in rare cases, over a millennium. An extreme case is the Vedic Sanskrit of the Rigveda: the earliest parts of this text may date to 1500 BC, while the oldest known manuscripts date to 1040 AD. Similarly the oldest Avestan texts, the Gathas, are believed to have been composed before 1000 BC, but the oldest Avestan manuscripts date from the 13th century AD. For languages that have developed out of a known predecessor, dates provided here follow conventional terminology. For example, Old French developed gradually out of Vulgar Latin, and the Oaths of Strasbourg (842) listed are the earliest text that is classified as Old French."
