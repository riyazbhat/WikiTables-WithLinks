  "intro": "Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in cricket. A batsman is caught if the batsman hits the ball, from a legitimate delivery (i.e. not a no-ball), with the bat (or with a glove when the glove is in contact with the bat), and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground. If the catch is taken by the wicket-keeper, then informally it is known as caught behind or caught at the wicket. A catch by the bowler is known as caught and bowled. This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player. (The scorecard annotation is usually c. and b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name.) Caught is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition, accounting for 36,190 Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012, which is 56.9% of all Test match dismissals in this period. South African wicket-keeper Mark Boucher holds the record for the most Test match catches, with 532, while Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most Test match catches by non-wicket-keepers, with 210."
