The school's team competes in NCAA Division I as part of the American Athletic Conference. The Bearcats are coached by John Brannen, who has been UC's head coach since 2019. With over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46-32. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the NBA (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season). Cincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at Fifth Third Arena, which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017-18 season at BB&T Arena on the campus of Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Kentucky while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the original Big East Conference in 2005, which was rebranded as the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in 2013."
