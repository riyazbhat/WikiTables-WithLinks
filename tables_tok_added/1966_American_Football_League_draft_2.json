  "intro": "The 1966 American Football League draft was held on Saturday, November 27, 1965. The AFL added the Miami Dolphins as an expansion team in 1966 to bring its total to nine franchises for its seventh season. The only Hall of Famer to come out of this draft was Jan Stenerud, who was picked by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the Red Shirt portion of the draft. This was the last competitive draft of the American Football League before the AFL-NFL merger agreement, which was announced in June 1966. The next draft of college players in 1967 was a common draft, held in mid-March. The 1966 NFL Draft was held the same day, November 27, 1965."
