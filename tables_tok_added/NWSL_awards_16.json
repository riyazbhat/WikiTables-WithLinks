  "intro": "The National Women's Soccer League hands out a number of annual awards. Six were awarded for the inaugural season in 2013, including: Golden Boot, Most Valuable Player, Defender of the Year, Goalkeeper of the Year, Rookie of the Year, and Coach of the Year. The awards are voted on by media (25%), coaches/owners (25%), and players (50%). In addition, NWSL Best XI and NWSL Second XI teams are named and voted on by journalists, club officials and NWSL players. Voters for the Best XI named selections for four defenders and a combination of six midfielders and forwards; with a minimum of one and maximum of three forwards. The Goalkeeper of the Year is automatically named to the Best XI. The NWSL Second XI team is composed of the subsequent vote recipient leaders at each position who did not make the Best XI."
