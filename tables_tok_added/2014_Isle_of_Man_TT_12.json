  "intro": "The 2014 Isle of Man TT Festival was held between Saturday 24 May and Friday 6 June 2014 on the 37.73-mile Isle of Man TT Mountain Course. The main races were six solo motorcycle races and two sidecar races. The festival also included Pre-TT Classic Races held on 23, 24 & 26 May 2014 at the Billown Circuit in Castletown. Post-TT races scheduled for 7 June 2014 were cancelled by race organisers on safety grounds due to a thunderstorm and heavy overnight rain. The blue ribbon event of the 2014 races, the Senior TT, was won by Michael Dunlop marking the 75th Anniversary of the only solo TT race victory by a factory BMW Motorrad machine ridden by Georg Schorsch Meier during the 1939 500 cc Senior Isle of Man TT Race. The 2014 TT races were again dominated by Michael Dunlop, repeating his 2013 IOM TT feat of winning four races within a week, riding a 1000 cc BMW in the Superbike TT and Superstock TT classes and a 600 cc Honda in Supersport TT Race 2. The 2014 Joey Dunlop TT Championship was won for the second consecutive year by Michael Dunlop with 116 points, with Bruce Anstey having 82 points and Dean Harrison in third place scoring 54 points. Michael Dunlop also scored a Junior/Senior TT double win during the 2014 TT Races raising his tally of Isle of Man TT race wins to 11 victories and 1 Classic TT win. Gary Johnson won the Supersport TT Race 1 riding a three-cylinder 675 cc Triumph at an average race speed of 124.526 mph, the first victory by a British machine since Bruce Anstey, also on a Triumph, won the 2003 600 cc Junior TT Race. The 2014 TT Zero Race was won by John McGuinness at a race-average speed of 117.366 mph, raising his tally of Isle of Man TT race wins to 21, the first win in the TT electric motorcycle category for the Shinden San / Mugen factory team. The Sidecar TT produced another maiden winner, with Race 1 being won by Conrad Harrison/Mike Aylott on a Shelbourne Honda 600 cc outfit at a race-average speed of 113.987 mph. The Lightweight TT Race also produced another maiden winner in Dean Harrison, after race favourite and fastest in practice Ivan Lintin retired on lap 1 at Union Mills with an electrical problem."
