  "intro": "M\u00e9tis in Alberta are M\u00e9tis people, descendants of mixed First Nations/native Indian and white/European families, who live in the Canadian province of Alberta. The M\u00e9tis are considered an aboriginal group under Canada's Constitution Act of 1982 and separate and distinct from First Nations (though they live in the same regions and have cultural similarities), and have different legal rights. Different Metis groups attempted to combine the joint influences of the Manitoba Metis Federation, the Metis Nation of Alberta, and the Metis Nation- Saskatchewan. This was done in hopes that the Metis peoples of Alberta would receive land and resource rights. In Alberta, unlike in the rest of Canada, M\u00e9tis people have negotiated certain lands to be reserved for them under the M\u00e9tis Population Betterment Act of 1938, known today as the Eight M\u00e9tis Settlements. These M\u00e9tis Settlements Federated in 1975 to protect existing M\u00e9tis Settlement lands following the Alberta Governments dissolution, by Order-In-Council of four M\u00e9tis Settlements from 1950-1960. Following legal challenges by the Federation of M\u00e9tis Settlements in 1975 for the loss of natural resource against Alberta, the Crown in Right of Alberta settled out of court for a suite of legislation that would see self-government, land, and money transferred to the newly formed government of the M\u00e9tis Settlements General Council (MSGC), Canadas only M\u00e9tis self-government. The M\u00e9tis Settlements General Council is the legislator of the Federation of M\u00e9tis Settlements. MSGC is the second largest land owner in the Province of Alberta."
