The primary task of the British Army is to help defend the interests of the United Kingdom, but it can also serve as part of a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) force, or a United Nations (UN) or any other multi-national force. To meet its commitments, the equipment of the army is constantly updated and modified. To meet any shortage or requirement on operations, the army can request equipment under an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR), which supplements planned equipment programmes."
