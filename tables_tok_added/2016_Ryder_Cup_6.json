The team consisted of : [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The leading four players on the Ryder Cup European Points List Points earned in all Race to Dubai tournaments starting with the 2015 M2M Russian Open and ending with the 2016 Made in Denmark that finished on August 28 , 2016 . The leading five players , not qualified above , on the Ryder Cup World Points List Total World Rankings Points earned in Official World Golf Ranking events starting on September 3 , 2015 ( the start date of the M2M Russian Open ) , and ending with the Made in Denmark tournament that finished on August 28 , 2016 , except that ( i ) all events in the week finishing on August 14 , 2016 ( the week of the men 's Olympic tournament ) , were excluded and ( ii ) only the Made in Denmark tournament ending on August 28 , 2016 , was counted for that week . The Open de France was allocated Ryder Cup points based on the OWGR points scale for a tournament whose winner earns 64 OWGR points , though the winner actually only earned 42 OWGR points . Three captain 's picks Announced in the week starting August 29 , 2016 . Only European members of the European Tour were eligible for the team and players could only earn points in the above two lists while they were a member of the European Tour . Paul Casey was not a member of the European Tour and was ineligible to earn points or be selected to the team .

If these OWGR points had counted , he would have qualified easily by finishing fourth on the world ranking list ; instead , he finished in tenth place , 12.36 OWGR points from automatic qualification , and was not selected as a captain 's pick .

  "intro": "The 41st Ryder Cup Matches were held in the United States from September 30 to October 2, 2016, at the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, a suburb southwest of Minneapolis. Europe entered the competition as the cup holders, having won in 2014 in Scotland for their third consecutive win. The United States won for the first time since 2008 at Valhalla, and featured the most lopsided American victory since a 9-point win in 1981 at Walton Heath. As in 2008, the U.S. never trailed during the tournament. Ryan Moore defeated Lee Westwood by 1 hole to reclaim the Cup with three matches still in progress. Captain Davis Love III dedicated the win to Arnold Palmer, who had died earlier in the week. A bag from Palmer's captaincy in the 1975 Cup was placed on the first tee during Friday's opening foursomes to honor The King, and Team USA also swept the opening foursomes on Friday morning for the first time since 1975 when Palmer had been captain. Two days after the matches, the majority of Team USA attended Palmer's public memorial in his hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and brought the trophy at the request of Palmer's daughter Amy."
