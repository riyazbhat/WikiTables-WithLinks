  "section_title": "Episodes -- Joe Schmo 2 ( 2004 )",
  "section_text": "In 2004 , Spike TV aired a second season of The Joe Schmo Show , called Joe Schmo 2 and tagged , `` The Schmo must go on . '' Rather than duplicate the premise of the first season , producers satirized reality dating shows such as The Bachelor and The Bachelorette with a fake show called Last Chance for Love . This time the premise was to fool two people , a man and a woman . The male role was filled by Tim Walsh , while Ingrid Wiese was chosen to be the female `` schmo '' . The series premiered on June 15 , 2004 . Ralph Garman returned to host the second season as Derek Newcastle , dying his hair blond and wearing a fake beard , glasses , blue contact lenses , and false teeth plus spoke with a British accent so he would not be recognized by the new contestants . The original `` Joe Schmo , '' Matt Kennedy Gould , taped a cameo appearance during an episode of Joe Schmo 2 as a pizza delivery man , but the segment was cut when the network decided to shorten the episode ; it did appear on the DVD . The Joe Schmo 2 was released on DVD with additional and uncensored footage in 2009 . The series took an unexpected twist within minutes of its beginning when Wiese became suspicious of some of her fellow contestants ( especially when one , who had only been hired for the first episode and was not aware of the nature of the program , told Wiese that her agent had arranged for her to appear on the show ) . Things reached a head when the character of `` Cammy '' , who was supposed to be telling Ingrid a secret , paused her story in order to allow the cameraman to change batteries . Wiese began openly questioning the contest , eventually stating during an interview segment that she did n't believe it was real . Since Walsh had not suspected anything was awry , the producers continued to conduct the show as it was while at the same time trying to figure out what to do with Wiese . It was finally decided that the producers would reveal to Wiese that she had correctly deduced that the entire thing was a hoax during an activity where Walsh was not present . Wiese was then made an offer : as long as she agreed to stay on the show , in effect becoming a cast member herself , and to not reveal the hoax to Walsh , she would receive the same $ 100,000 prize that Walsh would be given at the end of the series had he himself not figured the hoax out . Wiese agreed . In her place as the female `` schmo '' , Upper St. Clair , Pennsylvania native Amanda Naughton was added to the cast . [ 2 ] Naughton was a contestant that previously was n't chosen to appear on the show . As with the first season , the cast members ( including Wiese , once she was let on to the hoax ) portrayed characters based on archetypes common to many dating game and reality shows .",

  "intro": "The Joe Schmo Show is a reality television hoax show created by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese. The series was broadcast in the U.S. on the cable network Spike. The show's premise is that a target person or people are led to believe that they are contestants on a reality television show; in reality, all of the other participants in the purported show - including the host - are actors, and their actions and the outcome of the purported show are all scripted in an attempt to elicit comedic reactions from the targets. The show's first season, The Joe Schmo Show, aired in 2003, and its second season, Joe Schmo 2, aired in 2004. The first season's hoax was conducted as a typical reality competition show while the second hoax was a Bachelor-like dating series. On December 10, 2012, Spike announced it was bringing The Joe Schmo Show back for a third season, which premiered on January 8, 2013. The only constant presence in all three Joe Schmo seasons has been voice actor Ralph Garman, who has served as the emcee for all three editions (playing a smarmier caricature of himself in the first, a pompous British man in the second, and a bounty hunter in the third)."
