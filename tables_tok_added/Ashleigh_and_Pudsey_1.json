  "intro": "Ashleigh and Pudsey was a British dog trick act, comprising trainer Ashleigh Jade Butler (born 7 February 1995) and Pudsey (28 December 2005 - 20 July 2017), a male Border Collie, Bichon Frise, and Chinese Crested powderpuff cross. They achieved prominence as contestants in the sixth series of the television talent show Britain's Got Talent, which they won on 12 May 2012, becoming the first dog trick act to win the competition. On 21 July 2017, Butler announced that Pudsey had died. Following his death, Butler said that her other trained dog, Sully, would take over future events but would never become Pudsey."
