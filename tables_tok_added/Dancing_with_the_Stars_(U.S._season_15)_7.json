  "intro": "Season fifteen of Dancing with the Stars, called Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars, premiered on September 24, 2012. Tom Bergeron and Brooke Burke Charvet returned as hosts. The Harold Wheeler orchestra and singers provided music throughout the season. The returning members of the dance troupe for this season were Oksana Dmyrenko, Emma Slater, Sharna Burgess, Henry Byalikov, and Sasha Farber. Sonny Fredie Pedersen replaced Kiki Nyemchek. Season 15 was the first to feature an all-star cast, in which previous celebrities who have competed on the show have another chance to win the competition. Six of the returning finalists, however, had already won the title in prior seasons (Kelly Monaco, Drew Lachey, Emmitt Smith, Apolo Anton Ohno, Helio Castroneves, and Shawn Johnson). Season eight saw the most returning contestants, with 3 out of the 13 contestants coming from that season (Gilles Marini, Shawn Johnson, and Melissa Rycroft). In addition, it was the only season to date to offer fractional (0.5) scores. Five contestants reunited with their original partners, while the other eight danced with new ones. Season eight finalist Melissa Rycroft defeated season eight champion Shawn Johnson and season one champion Kelly Monaco to win the trophy. This also marked the first win for professional Tony Dovolani."
