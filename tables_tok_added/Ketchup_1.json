  "uid": "Ketchup_1",
  "intro": "Tomato ketchup, also known as catsup, ketsup, catchup, red sauce, and tomato sauce, is a sauce used as a condiment. Originally, recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, grapes, mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients, but now the unmodified term usually refers to tomato ketchup. Tomato ketchup is a sweet and tangy sauce now made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors vary, but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard, and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger. The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz. Hunt's has the second biggest share of the US market with less than 20%. In much of the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, ketchup is also known as tomato sauce (a term that means a fresher pasta sauce elsewhere in the world) or red sauce (especially in Wales). Tomato ketchup is most often used as a condiment to dishes that are usually served hot and may be fried or greasy: french fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, tater tots, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips."
