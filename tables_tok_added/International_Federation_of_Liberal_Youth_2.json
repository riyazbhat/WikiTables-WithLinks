  "intro": "The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) is an international liberal youth organization. It consists of a global membership of national youth organizations. These are often but not exclusively affiliated with political parties that are members of Liberal International. IFLRY holds full member status to Liberal International and the European Youth Forum (YFJ) which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with both these bodies. Since 2014 IFLRY has held special consultative status to ECOSOC. IFLRY also holds observer status to UNFCCC, and has sent delegations to COP since COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009."
