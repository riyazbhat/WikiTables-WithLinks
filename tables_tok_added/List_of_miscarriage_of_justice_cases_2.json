          "Twelve-year-old Nell Alma Tirtschke left home on an errand for her grandmother . Early the next morning , her body was found in Gun Alley . She had been raped and strangled . Ross was convicted on the basis of several witnesses who testified that Ross confessed to them as well several strands of blonde hair on a blanket at Ross 's house . In 1993 , a former school teacher named Kevin Morgan began researching Ross 's case . Morgan found a file in the Office of Public Prosecutions containing the original hair samples , which had been thought lost . In 1998 , two independent scientific authorities - the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and the forensics division of the Australian Federal Police - found that the two lots of hair did not come from the same person , thereby disproving with certainty the most damning piece of evidence presented at Colin Ross 's trial . Colin Ross was pardoned on May 27 , 2008 , 86 years after his execution"

Police developed the theory that he had slipped away from the hotel , attacked his family and returned to work , unnoticed . Blood on McLeod-Lindsay 's jacket was said to have been impact splatter , and deposited during the attack . Both victims survived the attack . Pamela McLeod-Lindsay was adamant that her husband had not attacked her . She said that the attacker had had an Australian accent . McLeod-Lindsay 's accent was Scottish . McLeod-Lindsay was charged anyway with the attempted murder of his wife and son . The prosecution contended that Pamela McLeod-Lindsay was lying to protect the family 's income . McLeod-Lindsay was found guilty . McLeod-Lindsay was exonerated after a further review by another blood spatter pattern expert determined that the pattern was likely caused by transfer when he cradled his wife rather than by blows"

This list includes cases where a convicted individual was later cleared of the crime and either has received an official exoneration, or a consensus exists that the individual was unjustly punished or where a conviction has been quashed and no retrial has taken place, so that the accused is assumed innocent. This list is not exhaustive. Crime descriptions with an asterisk indicate that the events were later determined not to be criminal acts."
