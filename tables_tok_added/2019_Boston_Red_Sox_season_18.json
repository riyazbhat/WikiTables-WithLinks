  "intro": "The 2019 Boston Red Sox season was the 119th season in the team's history, and their 108th season at Fenway Park. The Red Sox entered the season as reigning World Series champions, but did not repeat, as they were eliminated from the playoff race on September 20. With a record of 84-78 (.519), they finished third in the American League East, the first time they did not win their division since 2015."
