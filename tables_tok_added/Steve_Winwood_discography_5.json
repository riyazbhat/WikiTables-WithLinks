  "intro": "The discography of Steve Winwood, a British rock artist, consists of nine studio albums, two live albums, six compilation albums, and twenty five singles. After performing in the bands, the Spencer Davis Group, Traffic, Blind Faith and Ginger Baker's Air Force, Winwood launched a solo career in 1977. Winwood's self-titled debut album was released on Island Records in June 1977. Although the album peaked at #12 in the United Kingdom and in the Top 40 in the United States, its singles failed to gain success in either country. His second album, Arc of a Diver was issued in December 1980, certifying Platinum in the United States and Silver in the United Kingdom. The album's first track, While You See a Chance became a major hit in the United States, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. His 1982 follow-up album, Talking Back to the Night, did not produce any hits in the United States. However, the lead single, Still in the Game reached #19 on the Canadian Singles Chart and the second single, Valerie charted at #13 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Back in the High Life (1986) was aimed more towards Pop music, selling three million copies in the United States. Higher Love (spawned from the album) became Winwood's first number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Singles Chart, while also peaking at #13 on the UK Singles Chart. Freedom Overspill, Back in the High Life Again, and The Finer Things became major hits in the United States between 1986 and 1987. His fifth album Roll with It was released on Virgin Records in 1988, spawning the title track as the lead single."
