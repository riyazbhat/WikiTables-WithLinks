  "intro": "Sue Cook (n\u00e9e Orr; born 23 April 1958) is an Australian former racewalking athlete. She is a former world record holder in the 10 kilometres race walk and the 20 kilometres race walk. She competed six times at the IAAF World Race Walking Cup, taking bronze in 1983, and was selected for Australia for the 1987 World Championships in Athletics. Cook grew up in a sporting family - her father was a veteran-category runner while her older sister Jenny represented Australia at the 1972 Summer Olympics and set a long-standing national record in the 1500 metres. Her nephew, Daniel McConnell, was later an Olympic cyclist. A key figure in the early years of international women's walking, Cook took two titles at the IWF World Championships and was a six-time participant at the IAAF World Race Walking Cup. Her best finish at the latter event was a bronze medal at the first holding of the 10 kilometres race walk, finishing behind Xu Yongjiu and Natalya Sharipova. She also represented Australia at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics and 1987 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Cook broke a series of world records which were later recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations. She completed the 20 kilometres race walk in 1:41:42 hours in 1980 to knock over a minute and a half off the previous mark set by Thorill Gylder. Cook greatly advanced the sport by breaking the 20 km walk world record three further times, taking it down to 1:39:31 hours, 1:36:36 hours, and finally 1:36:23 hours in 1984. Her last record stood for only ten days at which point her national rival Sally Pierson bettered the time."
