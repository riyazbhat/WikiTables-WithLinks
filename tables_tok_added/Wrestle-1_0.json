  "section_text": "Wrestle-1 Hataage Sen ( WRESTLE-1\u65d7\u63da\u3052\u6226 , Wrestle-1 Hataage Sen , literally translated `` Wrestle-1 Raising an Army Competition '' ) was Wrestle-1 's inaugural event , which took place on September 8 , 2013 , at Tokyo Dome City Hall . [ 1 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] On August 9 , Wrestle-1 released the first partial card for the event , which revealed only the Wrestle-1 signed workers taking part in the event , but none of their partners or opponents . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The event featured a women 's match and the Japanese in-ring debut of Daiki Inaba . [ 35 ] [ 37 ] None of the other workers were revealed before the event , though Mutoh stated that TNA wrestlers would not be taking part in the event . [ 34 ] The event aired in Japan on Gaora and internationally on internet pay-per-view ( iPPV ) through Niconico and Ustream . [ 28 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Tickets to the 2,500 seat arena were sold out the day they went on sale . [ 40 ] Sports journalist Dave Meltzer wrote that this , coupled with AJPW 's recent decline in attendance numbers , showed that `` fans are taking Muto 's [ sic ] group as the real future of All Japan rather than All Japan '' . [ 40 ] The event featured outside participation from several freelancers as well as wrestlers from Big Japan Pro Wrestling , Dragon Gate , Michinoku Pro Wrestling , Pro Wrestling Zero1 and World Wonder Ring Stardom . Koji Kanemoto , Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e , Seiya Sanada and Zodiac , who were with AJPW prior to Mutoh 's departure , but had not announced their affiliation with Wrestle-1 , made surprise appearances during the event . In fact , Dupr\u00e9e , who took part in the main event , was still officially AJPW 's reigning Gaora TV Champion at the time of the event . [ 41 ] Dupr\u00e9e returned the title belt to AJPW three days after the event . [ 42 ] Bob Sapp , who had appeared in several of the old Wrestle-1 events , [ 9 ] made an appearance in a tag team main event with Mutoh . Kenta Kobashi , who had the previous March announced that he would be joining AJPW following his retirement in May , worked the event as a color commentator . [ 43 ]",
  "uid": "Wrestle-1_0",
  "intro": "The promotion shares its name with a series of professional wrestling events run by AJPW, K-1 and Pride Fighting Championships in the first half of the 2000s, but it is not considered a direct continuation of that project."
