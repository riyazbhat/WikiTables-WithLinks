          "In 1908, John T. Jones built this experimental blast furnace, named the Ardis Furnace after his daughter, to test an iron extraction process he developed.  The furnace as originally built was a huge rotating metal tube installed at a slight incline and held in place by a series of concrete supports. The Ardis Furnace was initially a success, but a fundamental heat problem limited its durability, and within two years Jones lost his personal fortune and the project was abandoned.  Some elements of Jones's technology were incorporated into later successful operations, but the ruins of the concrete supports are the only remnants of the Ardis furnace."
