The first Europeans to build in Alberta were the fur traders of the North West Company who constructed the first trading posts in Alberta at Fort Chipewyan and Fort Vermilion in 1788 . Few buildings from the fur trade era remain There is said to be 25 buildings built prior to 1882 still surviving in Alberta . Most buildings considered `` historic '' in Alberta are from the post-railway era ( e.g . after 1885 in Calgary , after 1891 in Edmonton ) The following is a list of oldest buildings and structures in Alberta constructed prior to 1900",
