  "section_text": "Painted Wheel of the Year at the Museum of Witchcraft , Boscastle , Cornwall , displaying all eight of the Sabbats Main article : Wheel of the Year Wiccans celebrate several seasonal festivals of the year , commonly known as Sabbats . Collectively , these occasions are termed the Wheel of the Year . [ 84 ] Most Wiccans celebrate a set of eight of these Sabbats ; however , other groups such as those associated with the Clan of Tubal Cain only follow four . In the rare case of the Ros an Bucca group from Cornwall , only six are adhered to . [ 115 ] The four Sabbats that are common to all British derived groups are the cross-quarter days , sometimes referred to as Greater Sabbats . The names of these festivals are in some cases taken from the Old Irish fire festivals , [ 116 ] though in most traditional Wiccan covens the only commonality with the Celtic festival is the name . Gardner himself made use of the English names of these holidays , stating that `` the four great Sabbats are Candlemass [ sic ] , May Eve , Lammas , and Halloween ; the equinoxes and solstices are celebrated also . `` [ 117 ] In the Egyptologist Margaret Murray 's The Witch-Cult in Western Europe ( 1921 ) and The God of the Witches ( 1933 ) , in which she dealt with what she believed had been a historical Witch-Cult , she stated that the four main festivals had survived Christianisation and had been celebrated in the pagan Witchcraft religion . Subsequently , when Wicca was first developing in the 1930s through to the 1960s , many of the early groups , such as Robert Cochrane 's Clan of Tubal Cain and Gerald Gardner 's Bricket Wood coven adopted the commemoration of these four Sabbats as described by Murray . [ citation needed ] The other four festivals commemorated by many Wiccans are known as Lesser Sabbats . They are the solstices and the equinoxes , and they were only adopted in 1958 by members of the Bricket Wood coven , [ 118 ] before they were subsequently adopted by other followers of the Gardnerian tradition . They were eventually adopted by followers of other traditions like Alexandrian Wicca and the Dianic tradition . The names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from Germanic pagan holidays . However , the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts , instead they exhibit a form of universalism . The rituals that are observed may display cultural influences from the holidays from which they take their names as well as influences from other unrelated cultures . [ 119 ]",
