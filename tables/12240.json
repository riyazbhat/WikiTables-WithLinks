          "For submarine operations as commanding officer of the U.S.S. Tang operating against two enemy Japanese convoys. Maneuvering on the surface into the midst of a heavily escorted convoy, O'Kane landed hits on three tankers, swung his ship to fire at a freighter and shot out of the path of an onrushing transport. Boxed in by blazing tankers, a freighter, transport, and several destroyers, he blasted two of the targets and cleared the area. Twenty-four hours later, he made contact with another heavily escorted convoy. In the midst of relentless enemy fire, he sent two torpedoes into the first and second transports and an adjacent tanker. He charged the enemy at high speed, exploding the tanker in a burst of flame, smashing the transport dead in the water, and blasting the destroyer. He fired his last two torpedoes at the remnants of the convoy before the second torpedo malfunctioned, performing a circular run and hitting the Tang in the stern. O'Kane along with eight officers survived the sinking. He remained a Japanese prisoner-of-war until 1945."
