Multiple independent investigations have been unable to determine the location of any flight recorders the aircraft may have carried. A proper examination of the crash site was not conducted until 15 years after the shootdown, by which time a majority of the wreckage had been displaced or scavenged. The manufacturer performed maintenance on the airplane a year before the crash, during which they documented that no recorders were installed (though mounting racks were in place for the operator to install them if they later decided to). Rwandan aviation laws at the time required all airplanes used for transporting the head of state to carry both a CVR and an FDR. The possibility that recorders were installed at some point between the work performed by Dassault and the shootdown has not been ruled out."

The greatest depth from which a flight recorder has been recovered is 16,000 feet ( 4,900 m ) , for the CVR of South African Airways Flight 295 . Most flight recorders are equipped with underwater locator beacons to assist searchers in recovering them from offshore crash sites , however these beacons run off a battery and eventually stop transmitting . For various reasons , a flight recorder can not always be recovered , and many recorders that are recovered are too damaged to provide any data"
