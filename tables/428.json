  "section_text": "After the Robbins Report of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled . [ 13 ] New universities included the University of Dundee , Strathclyde , Heriot-Watt , and Stirling . From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector and by the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges . [ citation needed ] In 1992 , the distinction between universities and colleges was removed . [ 14 ] This created new universities at Abertay , Glasgow Caledonian , Napier , Paisley and Robert Gordon . [ 15 ] in 2001 the University of the Highlands and Islands was created by a federation of 13 colleges and research institutions in the Highlands and Islands and gained full university status in 2011 .
