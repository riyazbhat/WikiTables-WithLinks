  "section_text": "London pioneered in the establishment of cable television in Canada , being either the first or second city in Canada with cable service , when Ed Jarmain and others wired the first 15 homes , and had to purchase TV sets for 14 of them . London 's first cable system , established in 1952 , broadcast American signals that crossed the border , including WICU from Erie , Pennsylvania . Shortly afterward , another cable operator , named Community Television was also established serving southwestern London and a `` gentleman 's agreement '' set a boundary , convoluted in the old London South ( Wortley Road ) area ; Community Television was later purchased by Maclean-Hunter , and Maclean Hunter was ultimately purchased by Rogers Cablesystems . London Cable TV later merged with Canadian Cablesystems , a cable operator owned by the Famous Players Theatre chain , with Jarmain remaining as chief executive . Canadian Cablesystems was acquired by Rogers in 1978 , and Rogers purchased Maclean Hunter in 1993 . Rogers TV Cable 13 , brings around 60 of the 76 home and away games of the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League . In the 2009 OHL Playoffs Rogers TV carried all home and away games in the London Knights schedule . This was the first time games from the Tulio Arena in Erie , PA and The Dow Event Centre in Saginaw , MI were broadcast on Canadian television . Rogers TV also has exclusive coverage of the Western Mustangs London had the second private local television station in Canada , CFPL ( on-air November 28 , 1953 ) , and CFPL was the first Canadian local channel to broadcast in colour ( 1966 ) . As part of CHUM Limited 's NewNet system was branded as The New PL . In August 2005 , CFPL was re-branded as A-Channel . In August 2008 , A-Channel was re-branded to A , effectively re-branding the CFPL station once more and in August 31 , 2011 , A was re-branded as CTV Two until September 2018 now CTV 2 . Several other stations from neighbouring cities have established retransmitters or are otherwise available in London , as follows :",
