          "The victim went to his neighbor's two-home property to feed his cats when a tenant's three dogs jumped the six foot fence and attacked him. Two men ran to help the screaming victim and the dogs attacked them. The men were able to drag the victim next door and close the gate, but the pit bulls found a hole in the fence and resumed the attack. The dogs had chewed off the victim's left hand and his face, leaving an eye hanging out. One of the men got a gun and shot two of the three pit bulls, but the dogs continued attacking, undeterred, until police and EMS arrived, at which point the dogs fled. Authorities arrested the dogs' owner immediately. The victim was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition and died a month later. Both assisting men were seriously injured; one spent 23 days in hospital. The three dogs were caught and put down. The dogs had a history of aggression and being at large. Ricky Davidson, 40, tenant of the neighbor's house, pleaded guilty to one count of reckless endangerment, a gross misdemeanor. Davidson was sentenced to 364 days in jail in connection to the death of Kenneth Ford. The sentence also included other dog-related and drug-related charges against Davidson that were bundled together in plea negotiations."
