  "section_text": "The 2008 version of Alas de Oro was held on August 8 , 2008 and this year included nine wrestlers in the same elimination match format that was used for the 2007 event . There were four wrestlers from the 2007 match that also participated in the 2008 version , including the previous winner Extreme Tiger as well as Aero Star , Escoria and Super Fly . In the 2008 event there was a more balanced Tecnico/Rudo mix than in 2007 as Rudos Jack Evans and Teddy Hart competed alongside \u00daltimo Gladiador , El \u00c1ngel and Gato Eveready . [ 1 ] Extreme Tigre was eliminated second to last , just before Aero Star pinned Jack Evans to win the match . [ 1 ] During the pinfall Jack Evans kicked out for a controversial finish . A rematch a few weeks later saw Aero Star get a clean , decisive victory over Evans to eliminate any doubt about who won the Alas de Oro"
