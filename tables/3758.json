'' The title was originally used by Augustus at the establishment of the Roman Empire to avoid the political risk of assuming the title Rex ( `` King '' ) in what was technically still a republic . In modern times , the title is often given to the sons and daughters of ruling monarchs . Also a title of certain ruling monarchs under the Holy Roman Empire and its subsidiary territories until 1918 ( still survives in Liechtenstein , and also in Monaco although that is elsewhere ) , and in Imperial Russia before 1917 .
