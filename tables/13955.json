  "section_text": "Map of Mexico with Quintana Roo highlighted Quintana Roo is a state in Southeast Mexico that is divided into eleven municipalities . Puerto Morelos , Tulum and Bacalar are the newest municipalities . [ 1 ] The state was created from the Quintana Roo Territory in 1974 with seven municipios . Solidaridad was formed in 1993 by act of the Congress of Quintana Roo . Tulum was split off from Solidaridad in March 2008 . [ 2 ] Bacalar was split off from Oth\u00f3n P. Blanco in February 2011 . [ 1 ] And in 2016 , Puerto Morelos was split off from Benito Ju\u00e1rez Municipalities in Quintana Roo are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico . [ 3 ] Every three years , citizens elect a municipal president ( Spanish : presidente municipal ) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council ( ayuntamiento ) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents . The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors ( regidores y s\u00edndicos ) . [ 4 ] Municipalities are responsible for public services ( such as water and sewerage ) , street lighting , public safety , traffic , supervision of slaughterhouses and the maintenance of public parks , gardens and cemeteries . [ 5 ] They may also assist the state and federal governments in education , emergency fire and medical services , environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks . Since 1984 , they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees , although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income . [ 5 ] While the population figures below are from 2010 , [ 6 ] they have been adjusted for the creation of the municipalities of Bacalar in 2011 and Puerto Morelos in 2016",
