          "Cawthra worked on figures for the Manchester Town Hall Extension. In a niche at opposite ends of the curved southern side of the building are statues of a standing male figure, one a philosopher and the other a counsellor. Mancunians called them \"Mr Therm\" given the presence of gas showrooms in the new building.[10] This work was carried out in 1938. Cawthra also sculpted two larger than life relief female figures on the gable at the Lloyd Street and Cooper Street end of the building. Both wear shawls and one holds a ship in her hand whilst the other holds a distaff. They represented \"commerce\" and \"cotton\"."
