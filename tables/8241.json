  "section_text": "The StubHub Center , home of the Los Angeles Galaxy , has hosted six editions of the MLS Cup From 1996 to 2011 , the MLS Cup was hosted by a neutral site selected before the start of the season in a manner similar to the National Football League 's Super Bowl venue . Three teams advanced to the final after being named as hosts : D.C. United in 1997 , the New England Revolution in 2002 , and the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011 . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Since the 2012 edition , the match has been hosted by the finalist with the highest regular season standing . [ 4 ] Several teams with smaller or inadequate stadiums have also considered using larger American football stadiums to host the MLS Cup , but all post-2012 editions have been played at regular MLS venues . [ 24 ] The move towards a non-neutral venue was deemed a risk due to the cold November and December weather in some northern cities , as well as the lack of adequate stadiums for some teams . [ 25 ] The MLS Cup has been hosted in eleven stadiums across nine metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada . [ 26 ] Dignity Health Sports Park , previously named the Home Depot Center and StubHub Center , in Carson , California , has hosted the MLS Cup the most times of any venue , with six editions between 2003 and 2014 . [ 27 ] The largest attendance for an MLS Cup final was the 2018 edition at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta , Georgia , with 73,019 spectators ; [ 12 ] the smallest was in 2005 at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco , Texas , with only 21,193 spectators . [ 17 ] [ 28 ] Only three editions have been hosted outside the United States , all at BMO Field in Toronto , Canada . [ 17 ]",
