Brown posed as a jogger and dragged her into the woods, and then strangled her with her shoelace. Brown then made numerous calls to the Riverside Police Department and the Jordan residence. One of Brown's subsequent calls was recorded by a police officer. Hello, Mrs. Jordan, Susie isn't home from school yet, is she? You will never see your daughter again. You can find her body on the corner of Victoria and Gibson. Brown was arrested after witnesses identified his license plate number. In his residence, police found Susan's books, a newspaper article about the case, and a Riverside telephone book bookmarked to the page of the Jordan home. Brown was late to work on the day she disappeared, a bloody jogging suit was found in his locker and Brown's shoes were matched to footprints from the crime scene."
