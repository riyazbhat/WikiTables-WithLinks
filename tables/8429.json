  "section_text": "Five other locations were considered in addition to the \u00d6stermalm Athletic Grounds to locate the Olympic Stadium . The Stockholm Olympic Stadium was built on the site of the former Stockholm Athletic Grounds in order to retain the other locations for other uses during the Games . By placing it to the north of the city , the Olympic Stadium was within the immediate vicinity of other pre-existing sporting venues . Initial funding was given to the sum of 400,000 Kr for a timber stadium but Torben Grut , [ 16 ] the architect , also drew up alternative plans for a stone stadium . Following discussions with the Swedish Central Association for the Application of Athletics , it was decided that the stone version should be built , and further funds were made available through a national lottery once guarantees were made that no further funding was to be asked for in order to build the stadium . [ 17 ] However it was found that the original estimate for the stone stadium would still be too expensive , and the plans were once more modified in order to simplify the design and reduce costs . An agreement was entered into with a contractor on 2 November 1910 that it would be transferred complete by 25 May 1912 . [ 18 ]"
