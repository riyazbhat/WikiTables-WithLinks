  "section_text": "The privileges of borough status are that the council chairperson is called `` mayor '' and up to one quarter of councillors can be called `` alderman '' , and the council can award freedom of the borough . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The Municipal Corporations ( Ireland ) Act 1840 extinguished all the boroughs in Ireland except for ten . In what would in 1921 become Northern Ireland , there were two remaining municipal boroughs in 1840 : Belfast ( made a city in 1888 ) and Derry ( officially Londonderry , and a city since 1604 ) . Five towns with abolished corporations remained parliamentary boroughs until 1885 ( Armagh , Carrickfergus , Coleraine , Dungannon , and Enniskillen ) as did three ( Downpatrick , Lisburn , and Newry ) [ 38 ] where any corporation was defunct by 1801 . Several of the urban districts in Northern Ireland created under the Local Government ( Ireland ) Act 1898 later received charters granting borough status . The Local Government Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1972 replaced the multi-tier local government system with 26 unitary districts whose councils could retain the charter of a borough within the district ; other districts later received borough charters in their own right . The 2015 local government reforms replaced the 26 districts with 11 larger districts . The `` statutory transition committee '' handling each council merger had the right to request transfer of borough status as in 1972 , [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] and unionist-majority councils did so , while nationalist-majority councils chose not to apply . [ 42 ] There were complications where places had city status ; [ 43 ] [ 44 ] therefore Belfast , Derry and Lisburn 's borough charters carried over automatically , without the need for the council to pass a resolution . [ 45 ] Although Newry received city status in 2002 , Newry and Mourne District Council did not receive borough status . In 2015 its successor Newry , Mourne and Down District Council voted not to request borough status , the required two-thirds majority failing after opposition from Sinn F\u00e9in . [ 46 ]"
