All of those players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame . The most recently retired number is that of Red Kelly , whose number was retired on February 1 , 2019 . [ 18 ] The Red Wings have also made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer available for issue . However , the numbers are not considered to be officially retired . [ 214 ] Although Aurie 's uniform was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris , current team owner Mike Ilitch does not consider the number to be retired . [ 215 ] Konstantinov 's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals . [ 216 ] Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky . [ 217 ] The banners with the retired numbers hanging at Joe Louis Arena",
