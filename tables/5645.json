          "April Jones, a five-year-old girl from Machynlleth, disappeared on the evening of 1 October 2012, after being sighted willingly getting into a vehicle near her home. Her disappearance generated a large amount of press coverage, both nationally and internationally. Five days after she was last seen, a local man, Mark Bridger, was charged with April's abduction and murder. He was found guilty of all charges on 30 May 2013. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. April's body has never been found, but police found skull fragments and blood in Bridger's home, which was matched to April Jones and indicated that she had suffered \"unsurvivable injuries\" at the hands of 47-year-old Bridger."
