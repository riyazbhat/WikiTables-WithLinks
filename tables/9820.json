In September 1994, Floyd kidnapped and murdered Michael; his body has never been found and was presumably eaten by wild hogs on Interstate 35. Floyd is also the prime suspect in the death of Sharon. It was discovered that his wife Sharon was raised as his daughter and is herself a kidnap victim of Floyd's.
