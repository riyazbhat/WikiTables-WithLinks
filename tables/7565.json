In this game the old Biff Tannen steals the 1950 - 2000 sports almanac and takes the Delorean time machine to 1955 and gives it to his younger self. As a result, Biff alters 1985, now ruling Hill Valley as a rich man. Marty Mcfly has to time travel in three different time periods, 1955, 1985, and 2015, to gather 30 items and solve the word puzzle for each item in order to get the sports almanac book and burn it. Later, Doc Brown and Marty are stuck in the year 1875, which should have been 1885. Marty has to gather 10 items and solve the word puzzle for each item. After the puzzles are solved, Marty and Doc can use the train to push the Delorean time machine car to get it to 88 MPH and get back to 1985."
