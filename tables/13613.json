The centre, second-floor window has moulded stone architrave. There is a former orangery at the north end with 5 round arched windows. The interior still retains it large staircase, moulded architrave, six-panelled doors and 18th-century fireplaces. DoE Reference: 9/364"

          "Built on the site of an earlier Congregational church which dated from 1660, this church in Millhams Street was built in 1866 to a Kemp-Welch and Pinder design. Constructed from buff brick with stone dressings and a roof of patterned, two tone slates; the sizable church and attached Sunday school buildings are mainly Gothic in appearance but with a mixture of Romanesque and Cinquecento detail. The tall, slender, steeple has a splayed pyramid spire with a weather vane finial. Below this is a clock, then recessed belfry with triple round-arched windows, 3 portholes with 'quasi-tiled' roof of stone to cornice, a two light Cinquecento window and a round-arched doorway. The west front has a double arched entrance in a low gabled porch constructed from pink stone with colonnettes, foliage capitals and vermiculated keystones. Above is a 4-light round-arched window with tracery of roundels (1 cusped) and Lombard frieze to gable. The 2 storey side elevations have lower windows with shouldered flat-arched lights under segmental relieving arch and foliage tympanum. The upper windows are 2-light Cinquecento style under cross gables. The attached Sunday schools have a similar elevation and roof. It is now a United Reformed Church. DoE Reference: 1A/56. The associated graveyards on either side of the street are also grade II listed. DoE Reference: 1A/57"
