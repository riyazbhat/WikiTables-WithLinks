  "section_text": "CZW Cage of Death XPromotionCombat Zone Wrestling [ 12 ] DateDecember 13 , 2008 [ 12 ] CityPhiladelphia , Pennsylvania [ 12 ] VenueViking Hall [ 12 ] Attendance1200 [ 12 ] Cage of Death X was the tenth annual Cage of Death event produced by the Combat Zone Wrestling professional wrestling promotion . It took place on December 13 , 2008 , at the CZW Arena in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The event was the eighth consecutive Cage of Death at the CZW Arena . [ 12 ] The show opened with a surprise as old CZW favorite Ric Blade came back to the promotion for his first in-ring appearance since 2004 , as the referee for the Junior Heavyweight Title Match . [ 12 ] The roof for the Cage of Death hung from the ceiling . Also hanging from the ceiling were the tables , ladders , chairs , ropes , rope ladders , and the CZW Junior Heavyweight Title . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Ryan McBride defeated Pinkie Sanchez , IWS regular Dan Paysan , Insanity Pro Wrestling 's Carter Gray , and All-American Wrestling/IWA Mid-South Wrestling 's Egotistico Fantastico in what may well have been the hottest match of the night to become the new CZW Junior Heavyweight Champion . The finish saw Pinkie Sanchez and Ryan McBride fighting on the ladder \u2013 both went to grab the belt and fell down , but McBride was holding the belt when they hit the mat . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Post-match , John Zandig brought out Lobo , Nick Gage , and Wifebeater to the ring to join Ric Blade , and credited them for being the reason why CZW still existed . Then New Alhambra Arena manager Roger Artigiani surprised Zandig by unveiling the 2008 New Alhambra Arena Hardcore Hall of Fame induction banner on the wall joining The Sandman , [ 12 ] Terry Funk , [ 12 ] Ted `` Rocco Rock '' Petty and Johnny Grunge as inductees . [ 12 ] A video promo followed , with Zandig stating that , `` if these five men want the $ 10,000 ... they 'll have to go through me '' - making Zandig the sixth man in the Cage of Death . [ 12 ] In a nice touch , the promotion did its third annual Toys for Tots toy collection , with uniformed Marines at the collection box at the Arena 's front door . The Arena would continue the collection at the afternoon 's CHIKARA and Velocity Pro Wrestling events . Fans are encouraged to bring a new `` unwrapped '' toy to the Arena for these shows , as Arena management and the promotions running the venue contribute back to the children of the Philadelphia area . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In a pleasant surprise , Sonjay Dutt plugged CZW after the match and suggested he might return as he could in 2009 ( with everyone waiting for the expected heel swerve that for once was n't forced on by a promoter ) . [ 12 ] 2 Girls , 1 Cup defeated The Olsens , Miracle Ultraviolence Connection , and Team Andrew to retain the CZW Tag Team Titles . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Given Nick Gage 's concussion at the time , expectations for this match were n't what they might have been under other circumstances . Gage won the match for H8 Club , as he hammered Ruckus at the end with at least 7 Chokebreakers at the end of the match . Ruckus was ruled unable to continue by the referee . Deranged defeated DJ Hyde in a Fans Bring the Weapons Match . Various toys used included a glass picture frame , a drum , a boat oar with thumb tacks , hand held plastic guitar , [ 12 ] and a knife The Cage of Death was a double cage structure with a four-sided steel wired cage inside the large four-sided wooden cage , a roof made up of a barbed wire spider net , wooden boards , and a scaffold topping the traditional four-sided original Cage of Death . Surrounding the Cage that surrounded the Cage-enclosed ring was a platform surrounding that with tables , chairs , lemon juice , salt , ladders , sheets of auto glass and other different goodies enclosed by a large second four-sided wooden cage . In the middle of That platform was a vertical wall of glass which exploded after Devon Moore took a `` Mother F ' n Bomb '' through it . [ 12 ] Other sick spots saw Devon Moore doing a shooting star press onto all but Zandig , Sami Callihan hitting a senton off the scaffold/spidernet through a barbed wire table on Brain Damage , and Drake Younger Russian legsweeping Danny Havoc off the side of the cage through a barbed wire board propped up by chairs . [ 13 ] In the end , Zandig got to the top of the structure to win the match . After the match , Zandig stated that he was trying to prove that `` his boys '' had their Onita style `` fighting spirit '' back , and handed out the $ 10,000 to all five other competitors . [ 13 ]",
