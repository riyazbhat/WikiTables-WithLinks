  "section_text": "The first Methodist churches were in Norwich ( 1757 ) , in Rotherham ( 1761 ) , in Whitby ( 1762 ) , and in Heptonstall ( 1764 ) About 700 Methodist chapels in the United Kingdom have been identified as significant buildings for their architecture or history by author Ian Serjeant , who has served as Conservation Officer for the Methodist church since 1996 . [ 8 ] A list of Methodist churches that are listed buildings was prepared by the U.K. Methodist church 's division of property in 1976 . [ 8 ] A standing committee of the Methodist Church of Britain is charged with having `` knowledge of the history , development and use of Methodist chapels , of Methodist liturgy and worship , or archaeology , of the history and the development of architecture and the visual arts , and the experience of the care of historic buildings and their contents '' , and to advise on about 250 renovation projects per year to the Methodist listed buildings . [ 9 ] Appropriate style for Methodist church buildings was debated during the mid-1800s .
