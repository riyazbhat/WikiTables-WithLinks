          "The Blaster (AKA the BMW Flamethrower hence the production video) was a 1998 invention by South African inventor Charl Fourie to provide a defence against carjackings. The invention came at a time when crime rates were rising and armed assault and carjackings became a serious public concern in South Africa. The Blaster was a liquefied petroleum gas flamethrower installed along the sides of the vehicle under the doors. Should a carjacker approach, the driver could raise his hands, faking surrender, then activate a pedal or switch and violent flames would erupt from the sides of the vehicle, neutralizing the assailant. The inventor claims it is unlikely to kill but would definitely blind the assailant."

          "The Churchill Crocodile was a British flame-throwing tank developed during the Second World War. It was a variant of the Tank, Infantry, Mk VI (A22) Churchill Mark VII], although the Churchill Mark IV was initially chosen to be the base vehicle. The Crocodile was introduced as one of the specialised armoured vehicles developed under Major-General Percy Hobart, informally known as Hobart's Funnies. Production started in October 1943, in time for the Normandy invasion of 1944."
