[ 2 ] Steel roller coaster Dragon Fyre includes 4 inversions , and is now the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counter-clockwise turning corkscrews . Out and back wooden roller coaster Wilde Beast has 3000 feet of track , while Wilde Knight Mares is a standing Enterprise ride featuring ten four-seater gondolas rises 60 feet , tilting 90 degrees . Viking 's Rage , was the first of three pendulum rides the park operated ; unlike the now removed Jet Scream , the boat ride does not go upside down . Spinovator features spinning kettles on a tilted platform . [ 5 ] ( Two years before opening , Dragon Fyre was simply called the Looping Corkscrew , and another ride was to be the Wildcat . ) [ 6 ] In May 1981 , Canada 's Wonderland Director of Rides and Ground Services Jim Wilson told the Toronto Star that The Wilde Beast ( along with two of the other original coasters at the park , Scooby 's Ghoster Coaster , and the Mighty Canadian Minebuster ) was wooden thanks to the apparent popularity of different styles of rides . `` Experiments '' found that steel coasters were n't as popular or enjoyable to the public , `` the sound and feel all contribute to the thrill of the ride . People just did n't like steel roller coasters . `` [ 7 ] Over the years , only four major attractions were added to Medieval Faire . Added in 1987 , The Bat was a backwards looping roller coaster , including one loop and two lifts . The park addition included a shop named the Belfry . [ 9 ] Later additions were Speed City Raceway ( 1997 ) , [ 10 ] Drop Zone ( 1997 ) , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and Cliffhanger ( 2000 ) . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] During the 1990s , almost all the rides were renamed : Dragon Fyre , Wilde Beast , Quixote 's Kettles , Wilde Night Mares , and Viking 's Rage became Dragon Fire , Wild Beast , Spinovator , Nightmares , and The Rage . When the park was sold to Cedar Fair , Paramount-specific ride names disappeared with Cliffhanger , Drop Zone becoming Riptide , Drop Tower , respectively . [ 11 ] Main article : Renamed attractions at Canada 's Wonderland In 2012 , the Leviathan joined the similarly named Behemoth at Canada 's Wonderland , stripping the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada . [ 15 ] It was the first new ride in Medieval Faire in more than a decade . Leviathan is ranked as the seventh tallest , and the eighth fastest roller coaster in the world . [ 16 ] It is Canada 's Wonderland 's 16th roller coaster . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The addition came quickly after the launch of the 230-foot-tall Behemoth roller coaster in 2008 , [ 19 ] and the 301-foot-tall swing ride WindSeeker in the 2011 season . [ 20 ]",
