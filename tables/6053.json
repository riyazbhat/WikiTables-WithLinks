  "section_text": "Before transistors were invented , relays were used in early computers . The world 's first working programmable , fully automatic digital computer , [ 250 ] the 1941 Z3 22-bit word length computer , had 2,600 relays , and operated at a clock frequency of about 4\u20135 Hz . The 1940 Complex Number Computer had fewer than 500 relays , [ 251 ] but it was not fully programmable The second generation of computers were transistor computers that featured boards filled with discrete transistors and magnetic memory cores . The experimental 1953 48-bit Transistor Computer , developed at the University of Manchester , is widely believed to be the first transistor computer to come into operation anywhere in the world ( the prototype had 92 point-contact transistors and 550 diodes ) . [ 252 ] A later version the 1955 machine had a total of 250 junction transistors and 1300 point diodes . The Computer also used a small number of tubes in its clock generator , so it was not the first fully transistorized . The ETL Mark III , developed at the Electrotechnical Laboratory in 1956 , may have been the first transistor-based electronic computer using the stored program method . It had about `` 130 point-contact transistors and about 1,800 germanium diodes were used for logic elements , and these were housed on 300 plug-in packages which could be slipped in and out . [ 253 ] The 1958 decimal architecture IBM 7070 was the first transistor computer to be fully programmable . It had about 30,000 alloy-junction germanium transistors and 22,000 germanium diodes , on approximately 14,000 Standard Modular System ( SMS ) cards . The 1959 MOBIDIC , short for `` MOBIle DIgital Computer '' , at 12,000 pounds ( 6.0 short tons ) mounted in the trailer of a semi-trailer truck , was a transistorized computer for battlefield data The third generation of computers used integrated circuits ( ICs ) . [ 254 ] The 1962 15-bit Apollo Guidance Computer used `` about 4,000 `` Type-G '' ( 3-input NOR gate ) circuits '' for about 12,000 transistors plus 32,000 resistors . [ 255 ] The first commercial IC-based computer was the IBM System/360 in 1964 . [ 254 ] The 1965 12-bit PDP-8 CPU had 1409 transistors and over 10,000 diodes . It was not a microprocessor , as it used discrete transistors on many cards ; but later microprocessors , such as the Intersil 6100 reimplemented it , see below . [ 256 ] The next generation of computers were the microcomputers , also known as home computers or personal computers ( PC ) , which used MOS microprocessors , in the 1970s . This list includes early transistorized computers ( second generation ) and IC-based computers ( third generation ) from the 1950s and 1960s",
