  "section_text": "Main article : SFR Yugoslavia Football Championship After the end of the Second World War , the country was restored however it became a socialist country with the victorious Partisan 's guerilla leader , Josip Broz Tito , as its new head-of-state . The multi-partidarian system was abolished and the Communist Party became the only existing political movement . In football , the new authorities abolished all clubs that had a monarchic or bourgeois connotation and most of the ones that kept their activity under occupation . [ 4 ] In Serbia the major impact was the disestablishment of the major clubs , among them BSK and Jugoslavija . Although BSK will be revived as OFK Beograd , and will even restore its name BSK between 1950 and 1957 , it will only be recognised as same club after the end of the socialist period . Its stadium and most of its property will be attributed to a newly formed club , FK Partizan , which was formed as the Yugoslav Army club . SK Jugoslavija stadium and its property , just as most of its players , will be attributed to the newly formed Red Star Belgrade which was unofficially the club of the Ministry of Interior . Football became a formidable tool to the regime which made it a forefront of diplomacy . Yugoslav clubs and players crisscrossed the globe , from Western Europe to Asia and Africa , doing their bit to nurture ties around globe , something which would be exploited by the governament in its propagation of the Non-Aligned policies . [ 4 ] Domestically , football provided entertainment for millions , and it developed into an industry that , like the rest of the economy , exhibited many of the traits of the capitalist West , alongside the unique features of the Yugoslav self-menagment socialism . [ 4 ] In this period football became a valuable asset to the authorities and enjoyed mass appeal . [ 4 ] In this period between 1945 and 1992 , the newly formed Belgrade clubs Red Star and Partizan will dominate the league . Although the rivalry between Serbian and Croatian clubs was kept , and will be particularly intense during the last years before the break-up of the country when the ethnic tensions were high , [ 8 ] the number of championships won by Belgrade clubs was much higher and proportionally increased in comparison with the pre-1945 period when the relation was balanced . In total , in this period , Red Star won most of the championships , 19 , with Partizan being in second place with 11 , Hajduk Split won 7 and Dinamo Zagreb , the successor of pre-1945 Gra\u0111anski , 4 . Another Serbian club , FK Vojvodina won 2 titles , and this period was also characterised by the appearance of clubs from Bosnia and Herzegovina as championship winning teams , with FK Sarajevo winning 2 , and FK \u017deljezni\u010dar , also from Sarajevo , winning one . In the first post war season , in 1945 , a league was played based on teams representing Republics , where SR Serbia won the title . This meant that geographically , Serbian teams had together 33 titles out of 47 seasons ( meaning 70.2 % of titles ) , with Croatian having 11 ( 23.5 % ) , and Bosnian 3 titles . By city , Belgrade based clubs took 30 titles , in second place was Split with 7 , third Zagreb with 4 , fourth Sarajevo with 3 and finally Novi Sad with 2 Despite the statistics , this period was characterised by the existence of the `` Big 4 '' ( Velika \u010detvorka ) , a colloquial name attributed to the four larger clubs in the country , Red Star , Partizan , Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb which usually represented the country at continental level . This period was marked by the appearance of first major international successes on club level . Serbian clubs made the best results , along with Croatian Dinamo Zagreb . The first to make a way to European final was Dinamo Zagreb who lost the 1963 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final . The next was Partizan , who in 1966 reached the European Cup final , losing to Real Madrid by 2-1 after winning by 1-0 until the 70th minute . In the following season , Dinamo Zagreb became the first Yugoslav club to actually win a European title , by winning the 1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup . Then it was Red Star who reached the final of the 1978\u201379 UEFA Cup , but the actual cherry on the top of the cake was the conquest by Red Star of the 1990\u201391 European Cup becoming the European club champion , and subsequently the World champion after winning the 1991 Intercontinental Cup . Hajduk Split , OFK Belgrade and Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 also made impressive results by reaching the semi-finals in European competitions . Beside this , in this period the Mitropa Cup was won by Red Star ( 2x 1958 and 1968 ) , \u010celik Zenica ( 2x 1971 and 1972 ) , Vojvodina ( 1977 ) , Partizan ( 1978 ) , Iskra Bugojno ( 1985 ) and Borac Banja Luka ( 1992 ) . The Balkans Cup was won by Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 ( 1975 ) , Dinamo Zagreb ( 1976 ) , NK Rijeka ( 1978 ) and Vele\u017e Mostar ( 1981 ) Serbia became the Republic who had the larger number of capped players in the senior national team , although that was natural as it was the Republic with higher number of inhabitants , with Croatia being actually the Republic who had proportionally the best relation with number of inhabitants/number of national team players . The player with most appearances for the national team was the Serb Dragan D\u017eaji\u0107 , a Red Star legend , and among the top 10 topscorers in the First League between 1946 and 1996 , 8 of them played in Serbian clubs , with the all-time league top-scorer being a Serb Slobodan Santra\u010d who represented all Belgrade-based clubs : OFK Beograd , Partizan and Galenika Zemun . Of the 57 seasonal top-scorers , 32 accomplished it while playing for Serbian clubs This period was marked by the recognition of full-time professionalism of the top division in 1967 . [ 9 ] Numerous domestic players had successful careers abroad as well . The league was formed almost exclusively with domestic players for most of the time , with the characteristic of the major clubs bringing players from medium and minor size clubs from different regions of the country . This specially became notorious during the 1980s when Red Star established a hegemonic position by acquiring the most talented footballers from other teams in the country . [ 10 ] After WWII there was an abrupt decrease in foreign players , and with few exceptions , they will only return as noticeable factor in the 1980s . Then some top level clubs started importing players , mostly from neighbouring countries , but also from Australia , Africa and Latin and North America . The curiosity was that with the fall of the Berlin Wall , numerous players from the former Communist countries joined lower-level clubs",
