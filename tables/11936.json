          "A little known gem of a neighborhood with uniquely designed houses in an enclave of historic homes. Some of its stately homes sit on double-sized tree-lined lots built in the 1920s and 1930s. Once farmland owned by the Grix family in then Greenfield Township. Platted in 1913 by Frank Grix as the Grixdale Home Park Subdivision. The stretch of Woodward Ave. (between 6 Mile and 7 Mile Roads) along Grixdale Farms is recognized as the first full mile of concrete paved road in the United States."
