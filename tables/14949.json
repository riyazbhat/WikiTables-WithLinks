  "section_text": "The Olympic Stadium was used as an underground bunker in World War II as the war went against Nazi Germany 's favor . [ 32 ] The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s . [ 33 ] As a host venue for the 1974 FIFA World Cup , the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands . [ 34 ] British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994 . [ 35 ] Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000 . [ 36 ] This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004 . [ 37 ] The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004 , [ 38 ] with a capacity of 74,228 people . The seating has been changed greatly , especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders . The stadium now plays host to Hertha BSC ( 1963\u2013present ) , and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come . For the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France . [ 39 ] Three years later , the venue hosted the World Athletics Championships . [ 40 ]"
