  "section_text": "Twenty-two venues were used for the 1936 Summer Olympics . Many were located in the Reich Sportsfeld complex Sailing was held in the Bay of Kiel , which would serve as the sailing venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich . [ 23 ] The Olympic Stadium would later be part of two FIFA World Cups and then host an IAAF World Championships in Athletics along with undergoing a renovation in the early 2000s to give new life to the stadium . Avus Motor Road ( AVUS ) was started in 1907 , but was not completed until 1921 due to World War I . [ 24 ] The track was rebuilt for the 1936 Games . [ 24 ] AVUS continued being used after World War II though mainly in Formula 2 racing . [ 24 ] The German Grand Prix was last held at the track in 1959 . [ 24 ] Dismantling of the track first took place in 1968 to make way for a traffic crossing for touring cars that raced there until 1998 . [ 24 ] BSV 92 Field was first constructed in 1910 for use in football , handball , athletics , and tennis . [ 25 ] The Reich Sports Field , which consisted of the Olympic Stadium , the Dietrich Ecekrt Open-Air Theatre , the Olympic Swimming Stadium , Mayfield , the Hockey Stadiums , the Tennis Courts , and the Haus des Deutschen Sports , was planned for the aborted 1916 Summer Olympics , but was not completed until 1934 . [ 26 ] Mayfield was the last venue completed prior to the 1936 Games in April 1936 . [ 26 ] Deutschland Hall was opened in 1935 . [ 27 ] Mommenstadion opened in 1930 . [ 28 ] Basketball was held outdoors at the request of the International Basketball Federation ( FIBA ) . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The tennis courts were used , which turned to mud during heavy rain at the final . [ 29 ] The K-1 1000 m canoeing final was also affected by heavy rain at Gr\u00fcnau that included thunder and lightning . [ 31 ] During World War II , Deutschlandhalle suffered heavy aerial bombing damage . [ 27 ] After the second world war , the hall was reconstructed and expansion has continued as of 2010 [ update ] . [ 27 ] The Deutschlandhalle in Berlin , where the boxing , weightlifting , and wrestling events took place , was used as venue , but was increasingly closed for repairs , last in 2009 when it was close for repairs , It was demolished in December 2011. the Mommsenstadion was renovated in 1987 and was still in use in 2010 . [ 28 ] The Olympic Stadium was used as an underground bunker in World War II as the war went against Nazi Germany 's favor . [ 32 ] The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s . [ 33 ] As a host venue for the 1974 FIFA World Cup , the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands . [ 34 ] British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994 . [ 35 ] Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000 . [ 36 ] This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004 . [ 37 ] The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004 , [ 38 ] with a capacity of 74,228 people . The seating has been changed greatly , especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders . The stadium now plays host to Hertha BSC ( 1963\u2013present ) , and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come . For the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France . [ 39 ] Three years later , the venue hosted the World Athletics Championships . [ 40 ]",
