          "Four members of the Ding family, Professor Jifeng \"Jeff\" Ding, his wife Helen Chui and their daughters Xing and Alice, were found murdered at their home in Wootton at 6:00 pm on 1 May 2011. They were thought to have been murdered two days earlier between about 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm, 29 April 2011 \u2014 the day of the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton and an additional Public Holiday. Anxiang Du, a businessman from Coventry who had been involved in a legal dispute with the Ding family, was named as the prime suspect in the case. Du fled the murder scene in the Ding's rented car; he drove to London and travelled to Paris by coach. He continued through France, Spain and finally to Morocco, prompting a worldwide manhunt. He lived in a partly built block of flats for 14 months before he was arrested and extradited to the UK. Du was tried at Northampton Crown Court in November 2013. He was found guilty of the murders and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years."
