  "section_text": "Main article : Climate of Manitoba Deep Lake at Riding Mountain National Park Manitoba has an extreme continental climate . Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north and increase from east to west . [ 17 ] Manitoba is far from the moderating influences of mountain ranges or large bodies of water . Because of the generally flat landscape , it is exposed to cold Arctic high-pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February . In the summer , air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States , as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico . [ 18 ] Temperatures exceed 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) numerous times each summer , and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the humidex value to the mid-40s . [ 19 ] Carman , Manitoba recorded the second-highest humidex ever in Canada in 2007 , with 53.0 . [ 20 ] According to Environment Canada , Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round , and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring . [ 21 ] Southern Manitoba ( including the city of Winnipeg ) , falls into the humid continental climate zone ( K\u00f6ppen Dfb ) . This area is cold and windy in the winter and often has blizzards because of the open landscape . Summers are warm with a moderate length . This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces , with moderate precipitation . Southwestern Manitoba , though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba , is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser 's Triangle . The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba . [ 22 ] This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the Canadian Prairie landscape . [ 22 ] Summers are generally warm to hot , with low to moderate humidity . [ 22 ] Southern parts of the province just north of Tornado Alley , experience tornadoes , with 16 confirmed touchdowns in 2016 . In 2007 , on 22 and 23 June , numerous tornadoes touched down , the largest an F5 tornado that devastated parts of Elie ( the strongest recorded tornado in Canada ) . [ 23 ] K\u00f6ppen climate types of Manitoba The province 's northern sections ( including the city of Thompson ) fall in the subarctic climate zone ( K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc ) . This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief , warm summers with little precipitation . [ 24 ] Overnight temperatures as low as \u221240 \u00b0C ( \u221240 \u00b0F ) occur on several days each winter . [ 24 ]",
