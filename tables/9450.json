  "section_text": "Druids generally observe eight spiritual festivals annually , which are collectively known as the Wheel of the Year . [ 99 ] These are the same festivals usually celebrated by Wiccans . [ 100 ] In some cases groups attempt to revive folkloric European festivals and their accompanying traditions . [ 98 ] In other cases the rites are modern inventions , inspired by `` the spirit of what they believe was the religious practice of pre-Roman Britain . `` [ 101 ] For reasons of practicality , such celebrations are not always held on the specific date of the festival itself , but on the nearest weekend , thus maximising the number of participants who can attend . [ 59 ] Four of these are solar festivals , being positioned at the solstices and equinoxes ; these are largely inspired by Germanic paganism . The other four are the `` Celtic '' festivals , the crossquarter days inspired by modern interpretations of ancient Celtic polytheism . The idea of the Wheel of the Year was introduced into Druidry by Ross Nichols , who founded the Order of Bards , Ovates and Druids in 1964 , and he had gained this idea from his friend Gerald Gardner , who had implemented it in his Bricket Wood coven of Gardnerian Witches in 1958 .
