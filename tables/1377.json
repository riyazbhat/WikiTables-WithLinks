  "section_text": "Main articles : 2014 Winter Olympics and Doping in Russia According to the director of the country 's antidoping laboratory at the time , Grigory Rodchenkov , dozens of Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , including at least 15 medal winners , were part of a state-run doping program , meticulously planned for years to ensure dominance at the Games . [ 282 ] In December 2016 , following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics , the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes ( the number later rose to 46 ) at the Sochi Olympic Games . La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the names of 17 athletes , of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation . [ 283 ] [ 284 ] Three female figure skaters were named as being under investigation . They are Adelina Sotnikova , the singles gold medalist , as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova . Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals , respectively , in pairs skating . Both also won gold medals in the team event , which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds . [ 285 ] In November 2017 the proceeding against Sotnikova was dropped . [ 286 ] Six cross-country skiers were suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren Report : Evgeniy Belov , Alexander Legkov , Alexey Petukhov , Maxim Vylegzhanin , Yulia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova . Legkov won a gold and silver medals , and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals . [ 287 ] The IOC disqualified all six from Sochi , imposed lifetime bans and , in the process , stripped Legkov and Vylegzhanin of the medals they had won in four events ( three individual medals and one team medal ) . Nikita Kryukov , Alexander Bessmertnykh and Natalya Matveyeva were also disqualified on December 22 , 2017 . [ 288 ] The International Biathlon Union suspended two Russian biathletes who were in the Sochi games : Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova . Vilukhina won silver in sprint , and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal . [ 289 ] They were disqualified and stripped of their medals on 27 November 2017 . [ 290 ] The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation suspended four Russian skeleton sliders . They were Alexander Tretyakov , Elena Nikitina , Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina . Tretyakov won a gold medal , and Nikitina won a bronze . [ 291 ] [ 292 ] On November 22 , 2017 , the IOC stripped these medals and imposed lifetime Olympic bans on all four . [ 293 ] Skeleton racer Sergei Chudinov was sanctioned on 28 November 2017 . [ 290 ] Seven Russian female ice hockey players were to have hearings before the Oswald Commission on November 22 , 2017 . Two of the seven were accused of submitting samples showing readings that were physically impossible to be held by a woman . The Russian women 's ice hockey team finished sixth at Sochi 2014 . [ 294 ] On December 12 , 2017 , six of them were disqualified . [ 295 ] Tatiana Burina and Anna Shukina were also disqualified ten days later . [ 288 ] On November 24 , 2017 , the IOC imposed life bans on bobsledder Alexandr Zubkov and speed skater Olga Fatkulina who won a combined 3 medals ( 2 gold , 1 silver ) . [ 296 ] All their results were disqualified , meaning that Russia lost its first place in the medal standings . Bobsledders Aleksei Negodaylo and Dmitry Trunenkov were disqualified 3 days later . [ 290 ] 3 other Russian athletes who did n't win medals were banned on 29 November 2017 . [ 297 ] Biathlete Olga Zaitseva and 2 other Russian athletes were banned on December 1 , 2017 . [ 298 ] Bobsledder Alexey Voyevoda who had been already stripped of his gold medals due to the anti-doping violations committed by his teammates was sanctioned on December 18 , 2017 . [ 299 ] Speed skaters Ivan Skobrev and Artyom Kuznetsov , lugers Albert Demchenko and Tatiana Ivanova , and bobsledders Liudmila Udobkina and Maxim Belugin were disqualified on December 22 , 2017 , bringing the total to 43 . Demchenko and Ivanova were also stripped of their silver medals . [ 288 ]",
