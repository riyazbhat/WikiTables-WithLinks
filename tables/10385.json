  "section_text": "Main article : Sports in Charlotte , North Carolina Charlotte is home to three major professional sports franchises : the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League ( NFL ) , the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , and a future team in Major League Soccer ( MLS ) . [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The Panthers have been located in Charlotte since the team 's creation in 1995 , and the current Hornets franchise has been located in Charlotte since its creation in 2004 . The Panthers play their home games in Bank of America Stadium , while the Hornets play in the Spectrum Center . [ 98 ] The original Hornets NBA franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team , but it relocated to New Orleans , Louisiana in 2002 after animosity grew between the team 's fans and principal owner George Shinn . [ 99 ] The NBA quickly granted Charlotte an expansion franchise following the departure of the Hornets , and the new franchise , the Charlotte Bobcats , began to play in 2004 . The team retook the Hornets name when the New Orleans-based team renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans in 2013 . [ 100 ] The name change became official on May 20 , 2014 . On the same day , the franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988\u20132002 Hornets . [ 101 ] MLS awarded its expansion team to Charlotte in 2019 and it is set to begin play in 2021 . [ 102 ] Charlotte is represented in ice hockey and baseball at the 'AAA ' professional level by the Charlotte Checkers and the Charlotte Knights . The Carolina Panthers were established by Jerry Richardson and several partners , mostly local business owners . In fall 2017 , Jerry Richardson put the franchise up for sale , and in May 2018 , billionaire businessman David Tepper purchased the team . [ 103 ]",
