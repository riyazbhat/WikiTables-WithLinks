  "section_text": "A microbrewery , or craft brewery , is a modern brewery which produces a limited amount of beer , usually with an orientation toward distinctive and flavourful products . In Australia , there is no strict definition for a microbrewery ; however , the definition for membership of the Independent Brewers Association provides a fair guide that could be considered appropriate . That is , a brewer sells less than 40 million litres of beer per annum and is not more than 20 % owned by a brewer that produces more than 40 million litres of beer per annum anywhere in the world . [ 20 ] The following is a list of notable microbreweries in Australia , listed alphabetically . In July 2017 , there was approximately 500 small breweries in Australia . [ 21 ]",
