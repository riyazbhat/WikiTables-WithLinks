The Plaintiff Company was incorporated for the purpose of constructing and working a railway in pursuance of a contract with the Government, for which the Government undertook to pay a subsidy ad to make grants of land. The other Plaintiffs as trustees for bondholders of the Company are assignees of a portion of that railway, of whatever right the Company have to the subsidy, and of the grants of land in respect of such portion. The Plaintiffs contend that the Government is bound to pay a certain amount of subsidy and to make grants of land for a completed portion of the railway, though as a whole it is not completed. The Government denies the liability, but, if it exists, sets up certain counter claims against the Company."

On 16 November 1898 the Deputy-Colonial Secretary wrote a letter of that date to the Minister of Agriculture and Mines enclosing four licences to cut timber which (he stated had been approved by His Excellency the Governor and which had been granted to the following persons, viz., to the respondent two blocks, one of which is the area in question in this litigation, and to the Appellants two other blocks."

I, chapter 16, and local statutes) as to so much of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim as accrued prior to 2 November 1899. The Plaintiffs had replied that the pleas disclosed no defence because the action was taken on a specialty contract under which the period of limitation was 20 years. The issue thus raised was heard on 1 February 1911 before the Full Court, which decided, by a majority of two out of three Judges (Mr Justice Emerson dissenting), that the Plaintiffs\u2019 replication was good."

The case was heard in the first instance before Mr. Justice Johnston, who found in favour of the Pulp Co. For the sum of $6,040 in respect of timber which had admittedly been wrongfully cut and appropriate by the Development Co., but he disallowed the claim in respect of certain other timber which he held that the Development Co. were entitled to cut and appropriate under a certain reservation clause of a sub-license which will be more particularly dealt with later on. On appeal to the full Court his Judgment upon the latter point was reversed and the damages were accordingly increased to $15,536.68. it is against this variation of the Judgment of Mr. Justice Johnston that the present Appeal is brought. The figures at which the damages have been assessed are not in dispute. The sole question is as to the right to recover these damages at all."

          "Their Lordships have had an opportunity of considering this case. The only question in dispute is the construction of the letter of 10 June 1912 which, at all events, was intended to be in effect a charter party. It is a dubious document in itself, and it is rendered more so by the interpretation which the parties themselves have put upon it; because they altered it by consent at the time of payment. The point in dispute really is whether the vessel in question was chartered month by month, or chartered for a definite period of three months. The Court below came to the conclusion that it was a monthly hiring. That decision ought not to be overruled unless their Lordships are clearly of opinion that it was wrong. The Appellants have not been able to convince them that it was wrong, and, under those circumstances, their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that the Appeal should be dismissed with costs."
