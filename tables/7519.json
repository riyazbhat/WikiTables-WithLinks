  "section_text": "Occasionally Rock Sound adds a new album to its Hall of Fame . The main criteria is thought to be influence \u2013 even within a particular genre \u2013 and for that reason many of the albums have been commercially successful as well as critically successful because they have then gone on to influence large numbers of bands or the music scene . Thus this differs from the Yearly Top Albums lists which do not take influence into account . In each article there is normally an interview with band members , a commentary on the album 's release , a look at its initial success , and reaction from other musicians as well . In some of the newer issues this section had been renamed to `` Throwback ''"
