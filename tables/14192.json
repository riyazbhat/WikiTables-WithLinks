Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans . [ 169 ] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available , and follows the completion of the UEFA ' B ' and ' A ' Licences . [ 170 ] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis ( i.e. , more than 12 weeks , the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control ) . [ 171 ] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment . Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker , including Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the longest-serving manager , having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his retirement at the conclusion of the 2017\u201318 season , and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828 , all with Arsenal .
