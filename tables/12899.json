In addition to the power increase to 100 kW ERP , it was reconfigured to 64QAM and 8k carriers , which resulted in a service area similar to the old analogue transmissions but with much more bandwidth available than Multiplex 1 ever had For the duration of the switchover , all the channels carried on Multiplex B were duplicated on this new PSB1 multiplex Channel 30 was re-used for Multiplex C , freeing Multiplex C 's old allocation at channel 43-",
