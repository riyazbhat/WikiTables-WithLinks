The modern visitor enters by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel. The exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village was easy to defend. One log was dated at 1278 so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area. Visitors can enter Balcony House through ranger guided tours.This photo is of an Emmett Harryson, a Navajo, at a T-shaped doorway at Balcony House (1929)."

The 150 rooms are not clustered like the standard cliff dwellings, nor is it one of the most elegant set of buildings; Stones were used without shaping for fit and stability. Two overhead ledges contain more rooms. One ledge seems to include an overlook with small holes in the wall to see the rest of the village below. A spring is accessible within several hundred feet and seeps are located in the rear of the village."

          "This ruin situated on Wetherill Mesa was professionally excavated in the late 1960s by archaeologist Arthur Rohn. The structure contains 94 rooms, in four levels, including a large kiva, with simple vertical walls and masonry pilasters. This ceremonial structure has a keyhole shape, due to a recess behind the fireplace and a deflector, that is considered an element of the Mesa Verde style. The rooms clustered around the kiva formed part of the courtyard, indicating the kiva would have been roofed."
