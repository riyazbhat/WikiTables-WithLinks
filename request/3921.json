As Minister of Finance under prime ministers Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Pierre Messmer, he won the presidential election of 1974 with 50.8% of the vote against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of the Socialist Party. His tenure was marked by a more liberal attitude on social issues\u2014such as divorce, contraception and abortion\u2014and attempts to modernise the country and the office of the presidency, notably launching such far-reaching infrastructure projects as the TGV and the turn towards reliance on nuclear power as France's main energy source. However, his popularity suffered from the economic downturn that followed the 1973 energy crisis, marking the end of the thirty glorious years after World War II. Giscard d'Estaing faced political opposition from both sides of the spectrum: from the newly unified left of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and a rising Jacques Chirac, who resurrected Gaullism on a right-wing opposition line. In 1981, despite a high approval rating, he missed out on reelection in a runoff against Mitterrand, with 48.2% of the vote.
