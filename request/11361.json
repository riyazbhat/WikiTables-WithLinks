  "/wiki/Julius_Skutnabb": "Julius Ferninand Skutnabb (12 June 1889 \u2013 26 February 1965) was a Finnish speed skater. A fireman by profession, he made his international debut at the World Allround Championships in 1914, but his international career was interrupted by World War I. He kept competing nationally, becoming the Finnish Allround Champion in 1914, 1916, and 1917. International activity resumed in 1922 and Skutnabb, already 32 years old, finished fifth at the World Allround Championships that year. After placing sixth at the world championships the following year, his best year came in 1924. At the 1924 Winter Olympics of Chamonix, he first won silver on the 5,000 m behind compatriot Clas Thunberg; the next day he became Olympic Champion on the 10,000 m, while Thunberg took silver. Since these were the first Winter Olympics to be held, his 10,000 m time automatically was the Olympic record. These performances, combined with his 500 m and 1,500 m times during those Olympics, were good enough for a third place in the allround competition (which was also an Olympic speed skating event, but only in 1924), and Skutnabb returned home with three medals \u2013 one of each colour. Later in 1924 Skutnabb won a bronze medal at the World Allround Championships, and in 1926 he became European Allround Champion.",
