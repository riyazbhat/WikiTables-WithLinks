Elena Dementieva was the reigning champion having won gold at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She retired from the sport in 2010 and thus did not defend her title. The first round provided some surprising results, with Li Na and Samantha Stosur both eliminated in three sets. The biggest upset was provided by Julia G\u00f6rges defeating Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in three close sets. Three British players made it into the second round but all fell in straight sets. Both finalists, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, were fighting for a Career Golden Slam, and Williams won the gold medal (without losing a set, without losing more than three games in any set, and without losing more than five games in any single match) and became the second woman to win a Career Golden Slam after Steffi Graf. Williams also became the first tennis player, male or female, to hold a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. Williams defeated Sharapova 6-0, 6-1 in the final. The bronze medal was won by Victoria Azarenka, who defeated Maria Kirilenko in the bronze medal match 6-3, 6-4.",
