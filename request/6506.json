  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",
  "/wiki/Windy_Point_Wind_Farm": "The Windy Point/Windy Flats project, located in Goldendale, Washington, is the largest wind farm Washington State.  The 90 square miles (230 km2) wind farm spans 26 miles (42 km) along the Columbia River ridgeline offering upon completion a capacity of 500 megawatts (MW).\n Construction of 400 of the 500 MW was completed by the end of 2009. Cannon Power Group, the project developer, constructed the 400 MW in two phases within 18 months\u2014Phase I (137 MW) and Phase II (262 MW).  A third phase is planned for 2010.\n The initial 400 MW represents an investment of over $1 billion.\nCalifornia will benefit from the Windy Point/Windy Flats project which could help the state meet its renewable energy goals since two California off-takers[further explanation needed] have purchased all 400 MW of power.\n Additionally, the project has provided more than 350 jobs over the past two years, plus creating many additional permanent administrative and operational positions.",

  "/wiki/Wild_Horse_Wind_Farm": "The Wild Horse Wind Farm is a 273-megawatt wind farm that generates energy for Puget Sound Energy that consists of one hundred twenty seven 1.8-megawatt Vestas V80 turbines and twenty two 2.0-megawatt Vestas V80 turbines on a 10,800-acre (4,400 ha) site in Kittitas County, Washington, 17 miles (27 km) east of Ellensburg, Washington. The turbines are placed on the high open Shrub-steppe ridge tops of Whiskey Dick Mountain, which was\nchosen for its energetic wind resource, remote location, and access to nearby power transmission lines. The towers are 221 feet (67 m) tall, and each blade is 129 feet (39 m) long, with a total rotor diameter of 264 feet (80 m), larger than the wingspan of a Boeing 747. The turbines can begin producing electricity with wind speeds as low as 9 mph (14 km/h) and reach full production at 31 mph (50 km/h). They shut down at sustained wind speeds of 56 mph (90 km/h). The site is also home to one of the largest solar array (500 kW) in Washington. The wind farm was developed by Horizon Wind (formerly owned by Goldman Sachs, later sold to EDP) EDP Renewables, a subsidiary of Energias de Portugal S.A. (EDP), a Portuguese utility company and built by Puget Sound Energy (PSE), an electric and gas distribution utility in the State of Washington. Construction began in October 2005 and was completed in December 2006.",

Kittitas County comprises the Ellensburg, Washington, Micropolitan Statistical Area.\n There are numerous interpretations of the county's name, which is from the language of the Yakama Nation. According to one source, it \"has been said to mean everything from 'white chalk' to 'shale rock' to 'shoal people' to 'land of plenty'\". Most anthropologists and historians concede that each interpretation has some validity depending upon the particular dialect spoken.",

  "/wiki/Stateline_Wind_Farm": "The Stateline Wind Farm is a wind farm located on Vansycle Ridge, which receives 16 to 18 mph (26 \u2013 29 km/h) average wind speeds from the Columbia Gorge, on the border between Washington and Oregon in the United States. With 186 turbines currently operating in both states and 279 more approved for construction, it is the largest wind project in the Northwestern United States and will be the largest in the world. Costing $300 million to build, it began operation in 2001. The project employs 660 kW capacity Vestas wind turbines, which collectively will produce a maximum electrical output of 306.9 MW. (The current operating capacity is 122.8 MW.) On average, the project is expected to produce 30 to 35 percent of that capacity year-round. Turbines are controlled individually by electronic systems which direct them into the wind and adjust the pitch of the blades to maximize electrical production at any wind speed from 7 to 56 mph. The turbines automatically shut down at wind speeds excess of 56 mph, a feature which allows them to withstand hurricane-force winds.",
