Under United States copyright law, all software is copyright protected, in both source code and object code forms, unless that software was developed by the United States Government, in which case it cannot be copyrighted.

  "/wiki/Genealone": "Genealone is web-based genealogy software.  It is developed in the PHP scripting language and it saves data in a MySQL database.\n The administrator can build an entire family tree on-line or import GEDCOM files from an external genealogy program. Either way, data can be edited and altered on-line. The administrator can allow other users to edit data or view hidden data as well, by setting up usernames and passwords with the appropriate privileges. Administrator and editors can also create static web pages and write blog posts.\n Visitors may search the pedigree database, display several types of textual and graphical genealogical reports, display the relationship between two individuals, and browse the global timeline, list of last names, list of places and events which happened in them, photo gallery, document list and pages with text information.\n Genealone is available as a standalone application or as a Genealone plugin for WordPress. It was mentioned in several genealogy blogs and sites.\n Genealone Lite is a free version of Genealone Expert, but limited to 20 persons and 10 gallery images.",

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman, former head of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms. This is in distinction to permissive software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.\n Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.\n In 2007, the third version of the license (GPLv3) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version (GPLv2) which were discovered during the latter's long-time usage. To keep the license up to date, the GPL license includes an optional \"any later version\" clause, allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF. Developers can omit it when licensing their software; the Linux kernel, for instance, is licensed under GPLv2 without the \"any later version\" clause.",

  "/wiki/HuMo-gen": "HuMo-gen is a free and cross-platform web application for displaying and editing genealogical data on the Internet. HuMo-gen was written in PHP and is GNU-GPL licensed open-source software. HuMo-gen supports UTF-8 and is bi-directional.\nThe project was founded in 1999 by Huub Mons in the Netherlands. It is now developed by Huub Mons and Yossi Beck with contributions of other users.\nSince March 2010 HuMo-gen is hosted on Sourceforge.\n HuMo-gen is installed on a web server and uses a MySQL database to store the genealogical data. The webmaster can build entire family trees on-line with HuMo-gen's editing menu or choose to upload GEDCOM files that were created with an external genealogy program. Either way, data can be edited and altered on-line and the data can be exported as a GEDCOM file for use with other programs. With the editing menu a range of genealogical data can be recorded, such as names, dates, places, sources, witnesses, aliases and notes. One can also attach photos, documents and video clips. The webmaster can allow other users to edit data and upload GEDCOM files as well, by allocating a username and password with the proper privileges.\nAs HuMo-gen is a web-based application, it may be installed on a PC on top of an Apache/PHP stack such as XAMPP\n The webmaster can control the data that will be visible to the end-user, by creating several user groups. The default group is \"guest\" which requires no login and will usually have the most stringent privacy settings. Other groups can have different privacy settings that may allow for more details to be shown, and will require log in with a username and password supplied by the webmaster. Privacy settings may hide certain data from the tree or hide entire trees.\n End-users may search the database and create several types of textual and graphical genealogical reports. Textual reports include ancestor, descendant and outline reports. Some of the reports may be exported as PDF. Among the graphical reports are the ancestor and descendant charts, hourglass chart, fan-chart and timeline chart. The program also includes a relationship calculator and Google maps integration. As of October 2011, end-users can choose from among 16 display languages (English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Hungarian, Danish, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Hebrew and Persian). The program also allows the end-users to choose from among several skins.",
