  "/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation": "Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) was a software company based in Santa Cruz, California which was best known for selling three Unix variants for Intel x86 processors: Xenix, SCO UNIX (later known as SCO OpenServer), and UnixWare. Eric Raymond, in his book The Art of Unix Programming, calls SCO the first Unix company. Prior to this, some prominent Unix vendors had been computer hardware manufacturers and telephone companies.\n In 1993, SCO acquired two smaller companies and developed the Tarantella product line. In 2001, SCO sold its rights to Unix and the related divisions to Caldera Systems. After that the corporation retained only its Tarantella product line, and changed its name to Tarantella, Inc.\n Caldera Systems becoming Caldera International subsequently changed its name to SCO then to The SCO Group (NASDAQ: SCOX; now delisted: SCOXQ.PK), which has created some confusion between the two companies. The company described here is the original Santa Cruz Operation (NASDAQ: SCOC). Although generally referred to simply as SCO up to 2001, it is now sometimes referred to as old SCO, Santa Cruz, or SCO Classic to distinguish it from The SCO Group to whom the U.S. trademark SCO was transferred.",
