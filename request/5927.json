  "/wiki/Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park": "Lassen Volcanic National Park is an American national park in northeastern California. The dominant feature of the park is Lassen Peak, the largest plug dome volcano in the world and the southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range. Lassen Volcanic National Park started as two separate national monuments designated by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907: Cinder Cone National Monument and Lassen Peak National Monument. The source of heat for the volcanism in the Lassen area is subduction of the Gorda Plate diving below the North American Plate off the Northern California coast. The area surrounding Lassen Peak is still active with boiling mud pots, fumaroles, and hot springs. Lassen Volcanic National Park is one of the few areas in the world where all four types of volcano can be found\u2014plug dome, shield, cinder cone, and stratovolcano. The park is accessible via State Routes 89 and 44. SR 89 passes north-south through the park, beginning at\nSR 36 to the south and ending at SR 44 to the north.",

  "/wiki/Horseshoe_Lake_Ranger_Station": "The Horseshoe Lake Ranger Station in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California is a backcountry ranger station that was built by Civilian Conservation Corps labor in 1934. The cabin typifies National Park Service standard designs for such structures in the prevailing National Park Service Rustic style then used by the Park Service. It is the only such example of a standard-plan backcountry ranger station in Lassen Volcanic National Park. There were originally two structures at the site, the residence, and a now-vanished barn. The rectangular ranger station is a log structure measuring about 33 feet (10 m) by 23 feet (7.0 m), extended by front and back porches. The front porch is a gabled structure supported by peeled-log posts. The back porch has no roof. Split-pole chinking is used throughout.",

The road was developed to allow tourists access to the central part of the national park, and was designed in accordance with National Park Service design principles for naturalistic road design and the National Park Service Rustic style of design and construction.

Loomis was a local homesteader and photographer who documented the 1915 eruptions of Lassen Peak, and was instrumental in the 1916 establishment of the national park. In 1929 Loomis donated the museum and 40 acres (16 ha) of surrounding lands to the National Park Service, which since then has used the structure as an interpretational facility.\n Loomis had desired that the headquarters of the new park be established at Manzanita Lake, but an alternate site was chosen by the Park Service.  Loomis and his wife Estella started building their own museum to exhibit photographs taken by Loomis and others, as well as geological exhibits and artifacts of local Native Americans. The building was dedicated on July 4, 1927 as the Mae Loomis Memorial Museum, named after their only child, Luisa Mae Loomis, who had died in 1920.",

  "/wiki/Manzanita_Lake_Naturalist's_Services_Historic_District": "The Manzanita Lake Naturalist's Services Historic District encompasses the historic area devoted to visitor interpretation services at the northwest entrance of Lassen Volcanic National Park in northeastern California. The district's earliest structures were built by Benjamin and Estella Loomis, who were instrumental in the establishment of the park and among the park's first concessioners. The 1927 Loomis Museum and its seismograph hut were built by the Loomises and were donated, together with 40 acres (16 ha) of land to the National Park Service in 1929. The Loomis House, also known as the Loomis Art House and Manzanita Lake Ranger Station, was built about the same time as the museum and served as their residence, photography studio and shop until the 1950s under the name \"B.F. Loomis Photo and Art Store\". Park Service structures were developed at Manzanita Lake in the 1930s. Park Service-designed and constructed buildings include the entrance station (1930), the ranger residence (1931) and the comfort station (1931). The naturalist's residence (1933) shares a similar design to its counterparts at Crater Lake National Park, with their design and construction techniques adapted to the short building seasons prevalent at both parks. The residence was built using Civilian Conservation Corps labor.",

  "/wiki/Park_Headquarters,_Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park": "The Headquarters Building at Lassen Volcanic National Park was built in 1928 in an adapted National Park Service Rustic style. The building served not only as the administration building but as a visitor center, and it quickly became too small for the developing park's needs. It was remodeled three times during its first eleven years. In 1932, the west wing was expanded with an addition that included men's and women's bathrooms and an enlargement to the superintendent's office. A back porch was added in 1935 to protect the doorways and windows from snow and to provide storage space for furnace wood. The park's Developmental Outline for 1938 states that due to development in the park, the building was not large enough, adding \"[m]oreover, the present building does not have sufficient storage space, is hard to keep warm in winter, and presents a bleak and unattractive aspect on the outside which gives all park visitors coming by the Headquarters Area a very bad first impression of the park.\" The park proposed moving the present building elsewhere on the site and converting it to housing, and building a new Administration and Visitor Center Building. Funding was not available for a new building so from 1939 through 1940 the building received a major renovation with the addition of an east wing, which also included an addition to the basement.",

It is the only such building known to have been built in this manner in the western regions of the National Park Service system. The interlocking boards extend past each other at the corners, forming a decorative detail.\n The ranger station was one of the first three building to be constructed in the park by the Park Service after the park's 1916 establishment.
