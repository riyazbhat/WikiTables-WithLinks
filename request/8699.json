  "/wiki/People_Express_Airlines_(2010s)": "People Express Airlines (stylized as PEOPLExpress) was an airline that began operations on June 30, 2014 from Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, targeting the no-frills budget flyer. The air carrier took its name from the original PEOPLExpress Airlines which operated in the 1980s, but was unrelated.  Due to complications with its contracted fleet, including one aircraft having been hit by a ground vehicle, the airline abruptly ceased operations on September 26, 2014, leaving some passengers stranded and others holding tickets that were not transferable to other carriers. Its hub airport located in Newport News commenced eviction of the airline from the airport terminal on November 12, 2014. On January 22, 2015, People Express Airlines was evicted from its offices at the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport."
