Berry (1984). \nIt is also known as the Pancharatnam\u2013Berry phase, Pancharatnam phase, or Berry phase.\nIt can be seen in the Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect and in the conical intersection of potential energy surfaces.\nIn the case of the Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect, the adiabatic parameter is the magnetic field enclosed by two interference paths, and it is cyclic in the sense that these two paths form a  loop.  In the case of the conical intersection, the adiabatic parameters are the molecular coordinates. Apart from quantum mechanics, it arises in a variety of other wave systems, such as classical optics. As a rule of thumb, it can occur whenever there are at least two parameters characterizing a wave in the vicinity of some sort of singularity or hole in the topology; two parameters are required because either the set of nonsingular states will not be simply connected, or there will be nonzero holonomy.",
