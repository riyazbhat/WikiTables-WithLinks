  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \nk\ng\nm\n2\ns\n\u2212\n3\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",

  "/wiki/Vansycle_Wind_Project": "The Vansycle I Wind Project (formerly Vansycle Wind Project) is a wind farm in Umatilla County, Oregon. It consists of 38 Vestas 0.66 MW wind turbines at the upper end of Vansycle Canyon  with a collective nameplate generating capacity of 25.08 MW. The project was the first commercial wind energy project constructed and operated in Oregon and began operation in December 1998. The wind turbines were constructed on leased portions of privately owned farms thereby sparing developers from buying property for the turbines and allowing farmers to generate extra income. Like nearby Stateline Wind Project, Vansycle Wind Project is owned and operated by NextEra Energy Resources formerly known as FPL Energy. The approximate center of the wind farm is located about 17 miles (27 km) west-southwest of Walla Walla, Washington 45\u00b055\u203223\u2033N 118\u00b037\u203248\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff45.923\u00b0N 118.630\u00b0W\ufeff / 45.923; -118.630Coordinates: 45\u00b055\u203223\u2033N 118\u00b037\u203248\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff45.923\u00b0N 118.630\u00b0W\ufeff / 45.923; -118.630.

  "/wiki/Stateline_Wind_Project": "The Stateline Wind Farm is a wind farm located on Vansycle Ridge, which receives 16 to 18 mph (26 \u2013 29 km/h) average wind speeds from the Columbia Gorge, on the border between Washington and Oregon in the United States. With 186 turbines currently operating in both states and 279 more approved for construction, it is the largest wind project in the Northwestern United States and will be the largest in the world. Costing $300 million to build, it began operation in 2001. The project employs 660 kW capacity Vestas wind turbines, which collectively will produce a maximum electrical output of 306.9 MW. (The current operating capacity is 122.8 MW.) On average, the project is expected to produce 30 to 35 percent of that capacity year-round. Turbines are controlled individually by electronic systems which direct them into the wind and adjust the pitch of the blades to maximize electrical production at any wind speed from 7 to 56 mph. The turbines automatically shut down at wind speeds excess of 56 mph, a feature which allows them to withstand hurricane-force winds.",
