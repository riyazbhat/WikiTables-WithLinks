  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha (sometimes called cha-cha), is a dance of Cuban origin.

In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo.

To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words Walzer (German), vals (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and valse (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz. The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation.",
