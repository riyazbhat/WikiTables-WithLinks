Trump's campaign rallies attracted large crowds, as well as public controversy.

He was a planter and owner of the Snowden plantation that he inherited from his father. He served the local militia for about ten years, making Captain of the local militia in 1794.

Randolph, known as \"Uncle Randolph\" when he visited Monticello, was considered as a candidate for the father of Sally Hemings' children following DNA studies that found that the Hemings children descended from the Jefferson line. The theory that Randolph Jefferson fathered Hemings children was discounted by the fact that Randolph did not visit Monticello often and, according to Monticello records, did not visit the plantation during the periods in which Hemings' children would have been conceived. He often socialized with the slaves during his visits. His son, Isham Randolph Jefferson, who lived at Monticello during his childhood is another alternate candidate for Hemings children's paternity.",

  "/wiki/Lloyd's_of_London": "Lloyd's of London, generally known simply as Lloyd's, is an insurance and reinsurance market located in London, United Kingdom. Unlike most of its competitors in the industry, it is not an insurance company; rather, Lloyd's is a corporate body governed by the Lloyd's Act 1871 and subsequent Acts of Parliament and operates as a partially-mutualised marketplace within which multiple financial backers, grouped in syndicates, come together to pool and spread risk. These underwriters, or \"members\", are a collection of both corporations and private individuals, the latter being traditionally known as \"Names\". The business underwritten at Lloyd's is predominantly general insurance and reinsurance, although a small number of syndicates write term life assurance. The market has its roots in marine insurance and was founded by Edward Lloyd at his coffee house on Tower Street in c. 1686. Today, it has a dedicated building on Lime Street within which business is transacted at each syndicate's \"box\" in the underwriting \"Room\", with the insurance policy documentation being known traditionally as a \"slip\". The market's motto is Fidentia, Latin for \"confidence\", and it is closely associated with the Latin phrase uberrima fides, or \"utmost good faith\", representing the relationship between underwriters and brokers. Having survived multiple scandals and significant challenges through the second half of the 20th century, most notably the asbestosis affair, Lloyd's today promotes its strong financial \"chain of security\" available to promptly pay all valid claims.",

  "/wiki/The_Internet": "The Internet (portmanteau of interconnected network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.",
