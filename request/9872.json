They currently play in the American Athletic Conference, though the Huskies will leave that league after the 2019-20 school year to join the Big East Conference. The UConn Huskies are the most successful women's basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships and a women's record four in a row, from 2013 through 2016, plus over 40 conference regular season and tournament championships. They have taken part in every NCAA Tournament since 1989; as of the end of the 2018-19 season, this is the third-longest active streak in Division I. \n UConn owns the two longest winning streaks (men's or women's) in college basketball history. The longest streak, 111 straight wins, started with a win against Creighton on November 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017 when a buzzer-beater at the end of overtime caused a 66-64 loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four to Mississippi State. The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008-09 and 2009-10), and was delimited by two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008 in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second - three seasons later - on December 19, 2010. The Huskies also own the longest winning streak in regular-season games in college history; after an overtime loss to Stanford on November 17, 2014, they won their next 126 regular-season games until a 68-57 loss to Baylor on January 3, 2019. UConn's current head coach is Luigi Geno Auriemma, who joined the team in 1985. Coach Auriemma is one of the best coaches in college basketball: his 1080-140 (.885) record as of January 2020[update] represents the highest winning percentage among NCAA basketball coaches (minimum 10 seasons), any level, men's or women's, while ranking him third in all-time women's wins behind former Tennessee coach Pat Summitt and current Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer.
