  "/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament": "The political groups of the European Parliament are the parliamentary groups of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is unique among supranational assemblies in that its members (MEPs) organise themselves into ideological groups as in traditional national legislatures. The members of other supranational assemblies form national groups. The political groups of the European Parliament are usually the formal representation of a European political party in the Parliament. In other cases, they are political coalitions of a number of European parties, national parties, and independent politicians.\n The political groups of the European Parliament are strictly forbidden to campaign during the European elections since this is the exclusive responsibility of the European political parties. Each political group is assumed to have a set of core principles, and political groups that cannot demonstrate this may be disbanded (see below).",

The party is sometimes referred to in English as the Great Romania Party. It briefly participated in government from 1993 to 1995 (in Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu's cabinet). In 2000, Tudor received the second largest number of votes in Romania's presidential elections, partially as a result of protest votes lodged by Romanians frustrated with the fractionalisation and mixed performance of the 1996\u20132000 Romanian Democratic Convention government. Tudor's second-place position ensured he would compete in the second round run-off against former president and Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) candidate Ion Iliescu, who won by a large margin. Parallels are often drawn with the situation in France two years later, when far-right Front National Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen similarly drew the second largest number of votes and was elevated, but defeated, in the presidential run-off against Jacques Chirac. Although Tudor clearly remained the central figure in the PRM, in March 2005 he briefly stepped down from the party presidency in favour of Corneliu Ciontu.",
