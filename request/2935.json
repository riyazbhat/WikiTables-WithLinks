  "/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ranger_Smith": "A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith is a stand-alone special parody of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series, The Yogi Bear Show, which revolves around Ranger Smith. A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith was made by The Ren & Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi and his company Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8. A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 24, 1999, along with Boo Boo Runs Wild, a similar Yogi Bear-themed stand alone special. Since its original debut in 1999, A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith has aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. This marked the last Yogi Bear production in which Greg Burson voiced Yogi, as he was arrested five years after its release and subsequently died in 2008. It is dedicated to William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.",
  "/wiki/Yogi_Bear": "Yogi Bear is an anthropomorphic funny animal who has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. He made his debut in 1958 as a supporting character in The Huckleberry Hound Show. Yogi Bear was the first breakout character in animated television; he was created by Hanna-Barbera and was eventually more popular than Huckleberry Hound. In January 1961, he was given his own show, The Yogi Bear Show, sponsored by Kellogg's, which included the segments Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle. Hokey Wolf replaced his segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show. A musical animated feature film, Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!, was released in 1964. Yogi was one of several Hanna-Barbera characters to have a collar. This allowed animators to keep his body static, redrawing only his head in each frame when he spoke - one of the methods used by Hanna-Barbera to cut costs by reducing the number of drawings needed for a seven-minute cartoon from around 14,000 to around 2,000. Yogi will be returning as a Main character for the first time in almost 30 years since Yo Yogi! in a new animated series for HBO Max titled Jellystone! Created by CH Greenblatt and Sam Register and Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, premiering sometime in 2020.",

  "/wiki/Spumco": "Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8, Inc. was an American animation studio based in Los Angeles, California. The studio produced three traditionally animated series, two Flash-animated cartoon series, two music videos, five animated shorts, and a comic book. The company also went on to produce content for a few animated spots and commercials. It won several awards, including an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject, for the Bj\u00f6rk music video I Miss You. Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 was founded in 1988 as a small office facility in the heart of Hollywood. John Kricfalusi named the company after the fictional Raymond Spum, who Kricfalusi jokingly described as the inventor of animation. Only a few short months after Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8's founding, Nickelodeon announced that they were looking for new cartoons. A concept claimed to be revived by then-president of Nickelodeon, Geraldine Laybourne, was that of creator-driven cartoons. Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 co-founder and then-president John Kricfalusi sold The Ren & Stimpy Show to Nickelodeon in 1988, which became Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8's first original animated series production. The Golden Age of American animation, like the 1940s cartoons by Bob Clampett and Tex Avery to name a few, served for inspiration for the surreal and highly expressive house style for which Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 became well-known. The Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 headquarters were located in Los Angeles, west of Paramount Studios. Amy Harmon of The New York Times said that the not-quite-underground headquarters was a nondescript building.",
  "/wiki/The_Animation_Show": "The Animation Show is a touring festival of animated short films that was first held in fall 2003. It was created by award-winning animators Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt. Following the demise of other American touring festivals of animation, such as Spike and Mike's Classic Festival of Animation,[note 1] the stated purpose of the Animation Show was to bring animated short films back into proper cinemas, where most of them were intended to be seen, and to free these artists from the dungeons of Internet exhibition. It was the first-ever festival of animation to be curated by working animators and was described as a passion project by its creators, not something intended to turn a giant profit. A sister series of Animation Show DVD volumes are also available, but the producers stress that the theatrical and DVD lineups are intentionally a little bit different, to encourage audiences to not just wait for the DVD but to visit the cinema and view these films properly. As stated on the Animation Show programs and flyers, once the current edition of the Show is out of theaters, it's gone forever. Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt programmed the first three Animation Show programs together. Don Hertzfeldt parted ways with the festival in 2008 and the fourth season of the Animation Show was released without his involvement.",
  "/wiki/Billy's_Balloon": "Billy's Balloon is a 16mm animated short by Don Hertzfeldt. It was his 4th and final student film at UC Santa Barbara. Similar to his other cartoons, he utilizes a minimalist stick-figure technique. The film was invited into Official Competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival (where Hertzfeldt was the youngest director involved), and it won the Grand Jury Award at the 1999 Slamdance Film Festival. On top of its film festival runs (and subsequent popularity online), the short has also appeared on Adult Swim and MTV in the US and on a number of international TV broadcasts around the world. Hertzfeldt has noted that the short's international popularity is likely because it has no dialogue and plays like a silent film.",

  "/wiki/Batman_Beyond": "Batman Beyond (known as Batman of the Future in Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia) is an American animated television series developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and Alan Burnett and produced by Warner Bros. Animation in collaboration with DC Comics as a continuation of the Batman legacy. Depicting a teenaged Batman in a futuristic Gotham City under the tutelage of an elderly Bruce Wayne, the series began airing on January 10, 1999, and ended its run on December 18, 2001. After 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one direct-to-video feature film, the series was put on hold for the Justice League animated series, despite the network having announced plans for a fourth season. Batman Beyond is set in the chronological future of the DC animated universe (despite being released before Static Shock, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited), and serves as a continuance of both Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures. Though the initial announcement of the series drew mixed reactions, Batman Beyond went on to receive critical acclaim and a cult following. The show is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, as well as cyberpunk and sci-fi themes such as the issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and scientific progress affecting society, and the psychology of the character of Bruce Wayne. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children's programs at the time, although producer Bruce Timm recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly Batman cartoon. It is also the first Batman series to portray the hero as a teenager. IGN named the show 40th on their list of Top 100 Animated TV Series. The premise of Batman Beyond has been used in various comic book stories published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.",

Boo Boo Runs Wild originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 24, 1999, along with A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith, a similar Yogi Bear-themed stand-alone special. Despite Boo Boo being the arguable star of this short, it is title carded as A Ranger Smith Cartoon. The short is dedicated to Ed Benedict, the original character designer for The Yogi Bear Show and other Hanna-Barbera properties of the 1950s-1960s. Since its original debut in 1999, Boo Boo Runs Wild has aired multiple times on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. Strangely, whenever aired on Adult Swim, it retains its original TV-Y7 rating and was never rerated to TV-PG. From January 2006 until April 2006 Boo Boo Runs Wild aired every Sunday on Adult Swim. On April 1, 2006, following the normal Neon Genesis Evangelion bump, Adult Swim aired Boo Boo Runs Wild as an April Fool's Day joke, despite all TV listings showing Evangelion in its normal time slot. Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo Runs Wild on Halloween night, October 31, 2008, as part of an advertised Halloween Stunt night, where obscure or randomly seen shows preempted the usual programming for that Friday night. In 2011 Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo Runs Wild every night from January 10 until January 14, as part of their DVR Theatre. It aired again on the nights of August 12, 2016, September 5, 2017 and January 6, 2019.",
  "/wiki/Kakurenbo:_Hide_and_Seek": "Kakurenbo: Hide & Seek (\u30ab\u30af\u30ec\u30f3\u30dc, Kakurenbo, lit.

The children who play this disappear, believed to be spirited away by demons. Kakurenbo follows Hikora, a boy who joins the game with hopes of finding his missing sister, Sorincha. The storyline is built on the idea that Tokyo is losing its natural aesthetic, which includes child's games such as hide and seek in order for industrial progress to ensue i.e. lighting the city of Tokyo costing innocence of childhood games.",

  "/wiki/The_Jetsons": "The Jetsons is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. It originally aired in prime time from September 23, 1962, to March 17, 1963, then later in syndication. New episodes were produced in 1985 to 1987 as part of The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera block. It was Hanna-Barbera's Space Age counterpart to The Flintstones. While the Flintstones lived in a world which was a comical version of the stone age, with machines powered by birds and dinosaurs, the Jetsons live in a comical version of a century in the future, with elaborate robotic contraptions, aliens, holograms, and whimsical inventions. The original series comprised 24 episodes and aired on Sunday nights on ABC beginning September 23, 1962, with prime time reruns continuing through September 22, 1963. It debuted as the first program broadcast in color on ABC-TV. (Only a handful of ABC-TV stations were capable of broadcasting in color in the early 1960s.) In contrast, The Flintstones, while always produced in color, was broadcast in black-and-white for its first two seasons. Following its primetime run, the show aired on Saturday mornings for decades, starting on ABC for the 1963-64 season and then on CBS and NBC. New episodes were produced for syndication from 1985 to 1987. No further specials or episodes of the show were produced after 1989 due to the deaths of stars George O'Hanlon and Mel Blanc."
