  "/wiki/Town_truss": "A lattice bridge is a form of truss bridge that uses many small, closely spaced diagonal elements forming a lattice. The lattice Truss Bridge was patented in 1820 by architect Ithiel Town.\n Originally a design to allow a substantial bridge to be made from planks employing lower\u2013skilled labor, rather than heavy timbers and more expensive carpenters, this type of bridge has also been constructed using many relatively light iron or steel members. The individual elements are more easily handled by the construction workers, but the bridge also requires substantial support during construction. A simple lattice truss will transform the applied loads into a thrust, as the bridge will tend to change length under load. This is resisted by pinning the lattice members to the top and bottom chords, which are more substantial than the lattice members, but which may also be fabricated from relatively small elements rather than large beams.",
  "/wiki/List_of_covered_bridges_on_the_National_Register_of_Historic_Places_in_Pennsylvania": "This is a list of covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Other bridges and tunnels on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania are listed elsewhere.\n In the early 1800s, the first covered bridge in the United States was constructed by Timothy Palmer crossing the Schuylkill River at 30th Street in Philadelphia.  This new bridge type, wooden with a covered span, was developed because traditional European methods, typically stone bridges, were not appropriate for the harsh Pennsylvania winters.  Many of the bridges were named for pioneer families residing near the bridges.\n Some people call Pennsylvania the \"Covered Bridge Capital of the Nation\"."
