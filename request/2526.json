The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history,  holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century\u2014more than any other party in a developed country\u2014and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's natural governing party.\n The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), occupying the centre-left to left.  Like their federal Conservative Party rivals, the party is often described as a big tent, attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre.\n The Liberals' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and reproductive choice.\n In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election, winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons.

  "/wiki/Reform_Party_of_Canada": "The Reform Party of Canada (French: Parti r\u00e9formiste du Canada) was a centre-right to right-wing populist federal political party in Canada that existed from 1987 to 2000. Reform was founded as a Western Canada-based protest movement and eventually became a populist conservative party, with strong social conservative elements. It was initially motivated by the perceived need for democratic reforms and by profound Western Canadian discontent with the Progressive Conservative (PC) federal government of Brian Mulroney.\n Led by its founder Preston Manning, Reform rapidly gained momentum in western Canada, and successfully supplanted the PCs as the largest party in Western Canada after the 1993 election. In opposition, the party advocated for spending restraint and democratic reform. In the leadup to the 1997 election, the party attempted to make a national breakthrough and replace the ailing PCs. However, a Liberal victory and disappointment with the lack of Eastern seats led many members to question the future direction of the party.\n The party was directly succeeded by the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which merged with the Progressive Conservative Party in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.",
