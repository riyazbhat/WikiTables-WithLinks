In 627 Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia. In the 9th century, Norsemen established the Kingdom of the Isles, which included the Isle of Man. Magnus III, King of Norway from 1093 to 1103, reigned also as King of Mann and the Isles between 1099 and 1103.",
  "/wiki/Manx_language": "Manx (native name Gaelg or Gailck, pronounced [\u0261il\u0261] or [\u0261ilk] or [\u0261e\u02d0l\u0261]), also known as Manx Gaelic, and also historically spelled Manks, is a member of the Goidelic (Gaelic) language branch of the Celtic languages of the Indo-European language family; it was spoken as a first language by some of the Manx people on the Isle of Man until the death of the last native speaker, Ned Maddrell, in 1974. Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it; in addition, Manx still has a role as an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts; in 2015, around 1,800 people had varying levels of second language conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a Manx-medium primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded: for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.",
  "/wiki/Douglas,_Isle_of_Man": "Douglas (Manx: Doolish) is the capital and largest town of the Isle of Man, with a population of 27,938 (2011). It is located at the mouth of the River Douglas, and on a sweeping bay of two miles. The River Douglas forms part of the town's harbour and main commercial port.\n Douglas was a small settlement until it grew rapidly as a result of links with the English port of Liverpool in the 18th century. Further population growth came in the following century, resulting during the 1860s in a staged transfer of the High Courts, the Lieutenant Governor's residence, and finally the seat of the legislature, Tynwald, to Douglas from the ancient capital, Castletown.\n The town is the Island's main hub for business, finance, legal services, shipping, transport, shopping, and entertainment. The annual Isle of Man TT motorcycle races start and finish in Douglas.",
  "/wiki/Jersey": "Jersey (/\u02c8d\u0292\u025c\u02d0rzi/ JUR-zee, French: [\u0292\u025b\u0281z\u025b] (listen); J\u00e8rriais: J\u00e8rri [d\u0292\u025bri]), officially the Bailiwick of Jersey (French: Bailliage de Jersey; J\u00e8rriais: Bailliage d\u00e9 J\u00e8rri), is a British Crown dependency located near the coast of Normandy, France. It is the second-closest of the Channel Islands to France, after Alderney. Jersey was part of the Duchy of Normandy, whose dukes went on to become kings of England from 1066. After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the 13th century, and the ducal title surrendered to France, Jersey and the other Channel Islands remained attached to the English crown. The bailiwick consists of the island of Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, along with surrounding uninhabited islands and rocks collectively named Les Dirouilles, Les \u00c9cr\u00e9hous, Les Minquiers, Les Pierres de Lecq, and other reefs. Although the bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are often referred to collectively as the Channel Islands, the Channel Islands are not a constitutional or political unit. Jersey has a separate relationship to the Crown from the other Crown dependencies of Guernsey and the Isle of Man, although all are held by the monarch of the United Kingdom. Jersey is a self-governing parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, with its own financial, legal and judicial systems, and the power of self-determination.",
  "/wiki/J\u00e8rriais": "J\u00e8rriais is the form of the Norman language spoken in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France. It has been in decline over the past century as English has increasingly become the language of education, commerce and administration. There are very few people who speak J\u00e8rriais as a mother tongue and, owing to the age of the remaining speakers, their numbers decrease annually. Despite this, efforts are being made to keep the language alive. A similar language, Guern\u00e9siais, is spoken in neighbouring Guernsey. The language of Sark, Sercquiais, is a descendant of the J\u00e8rriais brought by the Jersey colonists who settled Sark in the 16th century; and there is mutual intelligibility with the Norman language of mainland Normandy. J\u00e8rriais is often called Jersey French or Jersey Norman French in English (though this may give the impression that the language is a dialect of French) and jersiais or normand de Jersey in French. J\u00e8rriais is distinct from the Jersey Legal French used for legal contracts, laws and official documents by the government and administration of Jersey.",
  "/wiki/Saint_Helier": "Saint Helier (/\u02c8h\u025bli\u0259r/; French: Saint-H\u00e9lier; Norman: Saint H\u00e9lyi) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands in the English Channel. St Helier has a population of about 33,500, roughly 34.2% of the total population of Jersey, and is the capital of the Island (although Government House is situated in St Saviour). The urban area of the parish of St Helier makes up most of the largest town in Jersey, although some of the town area is situated in adjacent St Saviour, with suburbs sprawling into St Lawrence and St Clement. The greater part of St Helier is rural.\n The parish covers a surface area of 4.1 square miles (10.6 km2), being 9% of the total land area of the Island (this includes reclaimed land area of 494 acres (2.00 km2) or 200 ha).\n The parish arms are two crossed gold axes on a blue background, the blue symbolising the sea, and the axes symbolising the martyrdom of Helier at the hands of Saxon pirates in 555 AD.",
  "/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_in_Eurasia": "This is a list of sovereign states and dependent territories in Eurasia, along with other areas of special political status.\n Eurasia is a continent comprising the traditional continents of Europe and Asia. It is divided from Africa by the Isthmus of Suez. Some states such as Malta are traditionally part of Eurasia, however they lie on the African tectonic plate. It is separated from Australasia (Oceania) somewhere in the Malay archipelago, and is usually considered as including Indonesia and Timor-Leste (East Timor).\n Some areas are associated with Eurasian states, being part of them or dependent upon them, but are not physically in it. Examples are the Danish territory of Greenland, French overseas departments, some British Overseas Territories, and the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla."
