Dr. Luke, were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims breach of contract and defamation by Kesha.\n As of 2019, Kesha has reportedly sold over 71 million records in the United States and over 134 million records worldwide.
