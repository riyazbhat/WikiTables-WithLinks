Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living saint. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop. The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism. In the Catholic Church today, it is one of the Other Forms of Consecrated Life and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life. In England, the earliest recorded anchorites existed in the 11th century.",

A third similar vessel, the Lincoln Castle built in Glasgow, was launched in 1940. She was earmarked to become a floating restaurant in Swansea Marina in the early 1980s but was too wide to fit through the lock gates. She is now preserved at the Museum of Hartlepool as a floating exhibit at Jackson Dock, as part of the Hartlepool's Maritime Experience visitor attraction, which also includes HMS Trincomalee."
