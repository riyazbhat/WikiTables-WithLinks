  "/wiki/Chapel_Emmanuel_Railroad_Car": "The Chapel Emmanuel Railroad Car was one of thirteen railroad cars used as chapels in the United States starting about 1890.  Seven of the cars were built by the Barney and Smith Car Company of Dayton, Ohio and travelled from town to town, mainly in the sparsely populated western states and territories,  under the direction of the American Baptist Publication Society.\n In 1893 the Chapel Emmanuel car was the second car built for the Baptists and was the longest serving, being retired about 1938.  In the 1950s it was sold to a salvage business, Brandt Engineering Co., in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who stripped it of metal and used it for storage. By 1976 the car was given to Prairie Village, a museum near Madison, South Dakota and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_81": "U.S. Route 81 or U.S. Highway 81 (US 81) is a major north\u2013south U.S. highway that extends for 1,220 miles (1,960 km) in the central United States and is one of the original United States Numbered Highways established in 1926 by the American Association of State Highway Officials. The route of US 81 follows that of the old Meridian Highway (so called because it roughly followed the Sixth Principal Meridian of the US Public Land Survey System) which dates back as early as 1911. The highway has alternately (and unofficially) been known as part of the Pan-American Highway. In the segment in the state of Oklahoma, the highway closely corresponds to the old Chisholm Trail for cattle drives from Texas to railheads in Kansas in the 1860s and 1870s. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus is just north of Pembina, North Dakota, at the Canadian border. At this point, it is routed along Interstate 29 (I-29) and continues northward into Manitoba on Highway 75, which leads to Winnipeg. Its southern terminus is in Fort Worth, Texas, at an intersection with I-35W and US 287. Between the inception of the numbered highway system in 1926 through 1991, US 81's southern terminus was at the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas.",
