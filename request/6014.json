Established in 1888, Virginia plays its home games at Scott Stadium, capacity 61,500, featured prominently at the center of its campus near the Academical Village. UVA played an outsized role in the shaping of the modern game's ethics and eligibility rules as well as its safety rules, after a Georgia fullback died fighting the tide of a lopsided Virginia victory in 1897.\n Quickly asserting itself as the South's first great program with 28 straight winning seasons from its first in 1888, Virginia football claimed 12 southern championships and was the first program outside the Northeast to defeat perennial power (26-time national champions) Yale, on the first attempt in 1915.[a] During those early days, Virginia established long-lasting rivalries that still continue on: particularly the South's Oldest Rivalry with North Carolina and a heated rivalry with VPI (now Virginia Tech). Virginia has also played William & Mary annually or biennially for extended stretches since 1908.[b]\n Virginia lost its mantle as the region's mark of success between World War I and World War II, but soon thereafter Art Guepe had Virginia winning big again. To avoid the trappings of \"big-time football\",[c] university president Colgate Darden reduced scholarship and recruiting support, argued against joining the ACC, and declined an invite for Virginia to play unbeaten Georgia Tech in the 1952 Orange Bowl.[d] The Board of Visitors voted to join the ACC anyway, but Guepe left for Vanderbilt and Virginia soon embarked on a 28-game losing streak from 1958 to 1960 as Darden retired. Virginia became the worst ACC football team of the 1970s.[e]\nGeorge Welsh led a dramatic turnaround effort from 1982, and took Virginia to its first dozen bowl games and even its first AP No. 1 rankings throughout October 1990. He was the first ACC coach to reach 100 wins, and retired in 2000 with the most ACC wins (his 85 ranking second[f] as of 2019) of any coach in history. In 1995, similar to winning the first intersectional defeat of Yale 80 years prior, Virginia was the first ACC team to defeat Bobby Bowden's FSU teams after they started 29\u20130 in the conference. This nationally televised event created the Jefferson-Eppes Trophy, which Virginia currently (as of 2020) holds in Charlottesville after winning their latest matchup with FSU. Virginia remains the only ACC Coastal division program to have ever been ranked No. 1 in the nation as an ACC member.[g] Under current Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall, the team was invited to the (2019) Orange Bowl for the first time since turning it down in 1951.",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker (LB or backer) is a playing position in gridiron football.  Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \"back up the line\". Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \"two-point stance\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \"three-point stance\" or \"four-point stance\" before the ball is snapped).\n The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed. Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing. A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap. When a blitz is called by the defense, it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense's quarterback.\n Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense, due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense, when required. Similar to the \"free safety\" position, linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap, to determine their role during that particular play.",

Akron plays its home games on InfoCision Stadium on the campus of the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The Zips compete in the Mid-American Conference as a member of the East Division.\n The team was established in 1891 when the school was known as Buchtel College and became the University of Akron in 1913. In 1926, the athletic teams were named the Zippers, after rubber boots manufactured by the B.F. Goodrich Company, which was headquartered in Akron at the time. The name was shortened to \"Zips\" in 1950. Akron was originally classified as a Small College school in the 1937 season until 1972. Akron received Division II classification in 1973, before becoming a Division I-AA program in 1980 and a Division I-A (now FBS) program in 1987. The Zips were the first team to move from Division I-AA to Division I-A.  In 2005, the Zips won the Mid-American Conference championship for the first time in the program's history. Through the 2015 season, the Zips have an overall record of 507\u2013524\u201336.",

Of the 45 draft selections, 24 players were drafted from Canadian Interuniversity Sport institutions, which is the lowest percentage of CIS players taken since 2006 (26 of 50, 52%, were selected then).
