The College has more conference championships than any other school in the Colonial Athletic Association.

Dating back to the athletic program's beginning, there have been over 159 conference titles in all.\n William & Mary is the second-oldest university in the United States. Since the founding of its athletic program in 1893 the school's athletes have worn different colours and nicknames.  From 1893 to 1909 William & Mary football players were known simply as the Orange and White; this reflected the official school colors at that time. From 1910 to 1916 the team colors changed, and the new nickname, \"The Orange and Black\", reflected this. From 1916 to the mid-1980s William & Mary athletic teams were known as the Indians to reflect First American history in the area. Since 1978 the school's teams have been known simply as the Tribe. During the 2006\u201307 school year then\u2013College President Gene Nichol removed two tribal feathers from the William & Mary athletic logo to bring the program into compliance with newly passed NCAA regulations.

Most of its members are public universities, and the conference is headquartered in Richmond. The CAA was historically a Southern conference until the addition of four schools in the Northeast (of five that joined from rival conference America East) after the turn of the 21st century, which added balance to the conference.\n The CAA was founded in 1979 as the ECAC South basketball league. It was renamed the Colonial Athletic Association in 1985 when it added championships in other sports (although a number of members maintain ECAC affiliation in some sports).  As of 2006, it organizes championships in 21 men's and women's sports.  The addition of Northeastern University in 2005 gave the conference the NCAA minimum of six football programs needed to sponsor football. For the 2007 football season, all of the Atlantic 10 Conference's football programs joined the CAA football conference, as agreed in May 2005."
