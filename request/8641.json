  "/wiki/Toni_Sailer": "Anton Engelbert Toni Sailer (17 November 1935 \u2013 24 August 2009) was an Austrian alpine ski racer, considered among the best in the sport. At age 20, he won all three gold medals in alpine skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics. He nearly duplicated the feat at the 1958 World Championships with two golds and a silver. He also won world titles both years in the combined, then a paper race, but awarded with medals by the International Ski Federation (FIS).",
  "/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1956_Winter_Olympics": "At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, the six alpine skiing events were held from Friday, 27 January to Friday, 3 February. Toni Sailer of Austria won all three men's events to become the first alpine ski racer to win three gold medals in a single Olympics. The feat has been repeated once, by Jean-Claude Killy in 1968. The races were held at the adjacent Tofana, except for the men's giant slalom, which was held at Monte Faloria. The men's downhill was the final event.",

  "/wiki/Anderl_Molterer": "Andreas Anderl Molterer (born 8 October 1931 in Kitzb\u00fchel) is an Austrian former alpine skier. The White Blitz from Kitz (in contrast to Toni Sailer, who was the Black Blitz from Kitz), as he was known, was one of the best skiers of the 1950s, though labouring in Toni Sailer's shadow. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy he won silver in the giant slalom, and bronze in the downhill competition. In 1953, 1955, 1958, and 1959 he won the Hahnenkamm Race in Kitzb\u00fchel. He was absolutely dominant on the pro circuit in the early 1960s. Leading up to the 1968 Olympics, there was much speculation that Jean-Claude Killy might win all 3 skiing events. One writer (can't remember who) said it was not likely that anyone could do that, since the slalom and downhill favor different physical characteristics. He noted that the only time it had been done was 12 years before, in 1956, and that Toni Sailer won the giant slalom only because the great Anderl Molterer fell during a run so overpowering that he still came in second, as noted above.",
