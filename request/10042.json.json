  "/wiki/Clovis_culture": "The Clovis culture is a prehistoric Paleoamerican culture, named for distinct stone tools found in close association with Pleistocene fauna at Blackwater Locality No. 1 near Clovis, New Mexico, in the 1920s and 1930s. It appears around 11,500\u201311,000 uncalibrated RCYBP at the end of the last glacial period, and is characterized by the manufacture of \"Clovis points\" and distinctive bone and ivory tools. Archaeologists' most precise determinations at present suggest this radiocarbon age is equal to roughly 13,200 to 12,900 calendar years ago. Clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures of the Americas.",
  "/wiki/Paleo-Indians": "Paleo-Indians, Paleoindians or Paleoamericans, were the first peoples who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. The prefix \"paleo-\" comes from the Greek adjective palaios (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"old\" or \"ancient\". The term \"Paleo-Indians\" applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term \"Paleolithic\".",
  "/wiki/18000_BCE": "This timeline of human prehistory comprises the time from the first appearance of Homo sapiens in Africa 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing and the beginning of history, 5,000 years ago.\nIt thus covers the time from the Middle Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) to the very beginnings of world history.",
  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States, except Hawaii and territories of the United States. More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US, about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term \"American Indian\" excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives, while \"Native Americans\" (as defined by the US Census) are American Indians, plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities. The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro, instead being included in the Census grouping of \"Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander\".",
  "/wiki/Glacial_Kame_Culture": "The Glacial Kame Culture was a culture of Archaic people in North America that occupied southern Ontario, Michigan, Ohio and Indiana from around 8000 BC to 1000 BC. The name of this culture derives from its members' practice of burying their dead atop glacier-deposited gravel hills.  Among the most common types of artifacts found at Glacial Kame sites are shells of marine animals and goods manufactured from a copper ore, knows as float copper.",
  "/wiki/Red_Ocher_people": "The Red Ocher people were an indigenous people of North America. A series of archaeological sites located in the Upper Great Lakes, the Greater Illinois River Valley, and the Ohio River Valley in the American Midwest have been discovered to be a Red Ocher burial complex, dating from 1000 BC to 400 BC, the Terminal Archaic \u2013 Early Woodland period.  Characterized as shallow burials located in sandy ridges along river valleys, covered in red ochre or hydrated iron oxide (FeH3O), they contain diagnostic artifacts that include caches of flint points, turkey-tails, and various forms of worked copper.  Turkey-tails are large flint blades of a distinct type.  It is believed that Red Ocher people spoke an ancestral form of the Algonquian languages.",
  "/wiki/Old_Copper_Complex": "Old Copper Complex is a term used for ancient Native North American societies known to have been heavily involved in the utilization of copper for weaponry and tools. The evidence of smelting or alloying that has been found is subject to some dispute and a common assumption by archaeologists is that objects were cold-worked into shape. Artifacts from some of these sites have been dated from 4000 to 1000 BCE. Furthermore, some archaeologists find artifactual and structural evidence of casting by  Hopewellian and  Mississippian peoples to be demonstrated in the archaeological record.",
  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America, the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America, with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period, from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period. The term \"Woodland Period\" was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures. The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region, the Eastern United States, along to the Gulf of Mexico.",
  "/wiki/Adena_culture": "The Adena culture was a Pre-Columbian Native American culture that existed from 1000 to 200 BC, in a time known as the Early Woodland period. The Adena culture refers to what were probably a number of related Native American societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system. The Adena lived in an area including parts of present-day Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.",
  "/wiki/Middle_Woodland": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America, the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America, with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period, from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period.

  "/wiki/Goodall_Focus_(Hopewellian_Culture)": "The Goodall Focus was a Hopewellian culture from the Middle Woodland period peoples that occupied Western Michigan and northern Indiana from around 200 BCE to 500 CE. Extensive trade networks existed at this time, particularly among the many local cultural expressions of the Hopewell communities. The Goodall pattern stretched from the southern tip of Lake Michigan, east across northern Indiana, to the Ohio border, then northward, covering central Michigan, almost reaching to Saginaw Bay on the east and Grand Traverse Bay to the north. The culture is named for the Goodall Site in northwest Indiana.",
  "/wiki/Hopewell_tradition": "The Hopewell tradition (also called the Hopewell culture) describes the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern Eastern Woodlands from 100 BCE to  500 CE, in the Middle Woodland period. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or  society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations. They were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell exchange system.",
  "/wiki/Fort_Ancient": "Fort Ancient is a name for a Native American culture that flourished from Ca. 1000-1750 CE and predominantly inhabited land near the Ohio River valley in the areas of modern-day southern Ohio, northern Kentucky, southeastern Indiana and western West Virginia. Although a contemporary of the Mississippian Culture, they are often considered a \"sister culture\" and distinguished from the Mississippian Culture.  Although far from agreed upon, there is evidence to suggest that the Fort Ancient Culture were not the direct descendants of the Hopewellian Culture. It is suspected that the Fort Ancient Culture introduced maize agriculture to Ohio. The Fort Ancient Culture were most likely the builders of the Great Serpent Mound.",
  "/wiki/Oneota": "Oneota is a designation archaeologists use to refer to a cultural complex that existed in the eastern plains and Great Lakes area of what is now occupied by the United States from around AD 900 to around 1650 or 1700.  Based on classification defined  in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology, the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage.  The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times, such as the Ioway[citation needed].  A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated.",
  "/wiki/Mississippian_culture": "The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American civilization that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 to 1600, varying regionally. It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages (suburbs) linked together by loose trading networks. The largest city was Cahokia, believed to be a major religious center.",
  "/wiki/Miami": "Miami, officially the City of Miami, is the seat of Miami-Dade County, and the cultural, economic and financial center of South Florida in the United States. The city covers an area of about 56 square miles (150\u00a0km2) between the Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east. Miami is the sixth most densely populated major city in the United States with an estimated 2018 population of 470,914.

They traditionally speak the Potawatomi language, a member of the Algonquian family. The Potawatomi call themselves Neshnab\u00e9, a cognate of the word Anishinaabe. The Potawatomi are part of a long-term alliance, called the Council of Three Fires, with the Ojibwe and Odawa (Ottawa). In the Council of Three Fires, the Potawatomi are considered the \"youngest brother\" and are referred to in this context as Bod\u00e9wadmi, a name that means \"keepers of the fire\" and refers to the council fire of three peoples."
