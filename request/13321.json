  "/wiki/Apollo": "Apollo[a] is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. He is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros (ephebe,  or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu. As the patron deity of Delphi (Apollo Pythios), Apollo is an oracular god\u2014the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the averter of evil. Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers, foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees.",
  "/wiki/Belenus": "Belenus (also  Belenos, Belinus, Bel, Beli Mawr) is a sun god from Celtic mythology and, in the 3rd century, the patron deity of the Italian city of Aquileia. Called the Fair Shining One (or The Shining God), he was one of the most ancient and most-widely worshiped Celtic deities and is associated with the ancient fire festival and modern Sabbat Beltane. He was associated with the horse (as shown by the clay horse figurine offerings at Belenos's Sainte-Sabine shrine in Burgundy) and also the wheel. Perhaps like Apollo, with whom he became identified in the Augustan History, Belenos was thought to ride the Sun across the sky in a horse-drawn chariot.",

  "/wiki/Grannus": "Grannus (also Granus, Mogounus, and Amarcolitanus) was a Celtic deity of classical antiquity. Based on the etymology of his name, Grannus may have been associated with spas, thermal springs, and the sun; having bushy hair, beard and/or eyebrows; or having a connection with the concept of shining/gleaming . He was regularly identified with Apollo as Apollo Grannus. He was frequently worshipped in conjunction  with Sirona, and sometimes with Mars and other deities.",
  "/wiki/Beli_Mawr": "Beli Mawr (Beli the Great) was an ancestor figure in Middle Welsh literature and genealogies. He is the father of Cassivellaunus, Arianrhod, Lludd Llaw Eraint, Llefelys, and Afallach. In certain medieval genealogies he is listed as the husband of Anna, cousin of Mary, mother of Jesus. According to the Welsh Triads, Beli and D\u00f4n were the parents of Arianrhod, but the mother of Beli's other children\u2014and the father of D\u00f4n's other children\u2014is not mentioned in the medieval Welsh literature. Several royal lines in medieval Wales traced their ancestry to Beli. The Mabinogi names Penarddun as a daughter of Beli Mawr, but the genealogy is confused; it is possible she was meant to be his sister rather than daughter.",
  "/wiki/Maponos": "In ancient Celtic religion, Maponos or Maponus (Great Son) is a god of youth known mainly in northern Britain but also in Gaul. In Roman Britain, he was equated with Apollo. The Welsh mythological figure Mabon ap Modron is apparently derived from Maponos, who by analogy we may suggest was the son of the mother-goddess Dea Matrona. The Irish god Aengus, also known as the Mac \u00d3g (young son), is probably related to Maponos, as are the Arthurian characters Mabuz and Mabonagrain.",

The text's restitution as Cathubodua depends on the assumptions that an initial C has been lost and that the personal names ATEBODVAE, ATEBODVVS and ATEBODVI in 3 other inscriptions in modern Austria and Slovenia are unrelated. She appears to be identical to the Irish goddess Badb Catha; under this identification, Badb Catha would foresee the fate of warriors before the battle. Nicole Jufer and Thierry Luginb\u00fchl provisionally link Cathubodua with other apparently martial goddesses attested elsewhere, such as Boudina, Bodua, and Boudiga, whose names share roots meaning either 'fighting' or 'victory'. She would therefore be comparable to the Roman Victoria and the Greek goddess Nike and possibly the Nordic goddess Sigyn.",

She is known to cause fear and confusion among soldiers to move the tide of battle to her favoured side. Badb may also appear prior to a battle to foreshadow the extent of the carnage to come, or to predict the death of a notable person. She would sometimes do this through wailing cries, leading to comparisons with the bean-s\u00eddhe (banshee). With her sisters, Macha and Nemain or  Anand, Badb is part of a trio of war goddesses known as the three Morr\u00edgna.",

She appears in Irish mythology as a member of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the daughter of the Dagda and wife of Bres, with whom she had a son named Ruad\u00e1n. It has been suggested that Brigid is a continuation of the Indo-European dawn goddess. She is associated with the spring season, fertility, healing, poetry and smithcraft. Cormac's Glossary, written in the 10th century by Christian monks, says that Brigid was the goddess whom poets adored and that she had two sisters: Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith. This suggests she may have been a triple deity. Saint Brigid shares many of the goddess's attributes and her feast day on 1 February was originally a pagan festival (Imbolc) marking the beginning of spring. It has thus been argued that the saint is a Christianization of the goddess.",

The name is Gaulish and means \u201cAll-Breast\u201d or \u201cGreat-Breasted\u201d and is probably used to signify strength. In the Gallo-Roman religion, Cicolluis is thought to be a common epithet for Gaulish Mars. A Latin dedicatory inscription from Narbonne (which was in the far south of Gaul), France, bears the words MARTI CICOLLUI ET LITAVI (\u201cMars Cicolluis and Litavis\u201d)., \u201cMars Cicolluis\u201d has dedications in Xanten, Germany, and Aignay-le-Duc (where his consort is given as Litavis) and M\u00e2lain (where his consorts are given as Litavis and Bellona, Roman goddess and personification of war) of the C\u00f4te-d'Or, France. \u201cCicolluis\u201d is named alone (not as an epithet of Mars) in an inscription at Chassey, C\u00f4te-d'Or, Franche-Comt\u00e9, France, and a partial inscription from Ruffey-l\u00e8s-Echirey, C\u00f4te-d'Or, France, may be dedicated to Cicolluis.

His thyrsus, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. As Eleutherios (the liberator), his wine, music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself. In his religion, identical with or closely related to Orphism, Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of Zeus and Persephone, and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus. Many believed that he had been born twice, having been killed and reborn as the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. In the Eleusinian Mysteries he was identified with Iacchus, the son (or, alternately, husband) of Demeter.",

Dis was originally associated with fertile agricultural land and mineral wealth, and since those minerals came from underground, he was later equated with the chthonic deities Pluto (Hades) and Orcus. D\u012bs Pater was commonly shortened to simply D\u012bs and this name has since become an alternative name for the underworld or a part of the underworld, such as the City of Dis of Dante's The Divine Comedy, which comprises Lower Hell. It is often thought that D\u012bs Pater was also a Celtic god. This confusion arises from the second-hand citation of one of Julius Caesar's comments in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars (VI:18), where he says that the Gauls all claimed descent from D\u012bs Pater. However, Caesar's remark is a clear example of interpretatio Romana: what Caesar meant was that the Gauls all claimed descent from a Gaulish god that reminded him of the Roman D\u012bs Pater, a scholia on the Pharsalia equates Dis Pater with Taranis, the chief sky deity in the Gaulish religion.

She is intelligent, politically strategic, beautiful, and famed for her wealth and generosity. With Pwyll she has a son, the hero Pryderi, who later inherits the lordship of Dyfed. She endures tragedy when her newborn child is abducted, and she is accused of infanticide.

Hera also afflicted Lamia with sleeplessness so she would anguish constantly, but Zeus gave her the ability to remove her own eyes. Lamia was also used as a bogey word to frighten and discipline children. In later traditions and storytelling, the lamiai became a type of phantom, synonymous with the empusai which seduced youths to satisfy their sexual appetite and fed on their flesh afterward. A fabulous biography of Apollonius of Tyana defeating a lamia seductress has inspired the poem Lamia by Keats. The lamia has been ascribed serpentine qualities, which some commentators believe can be firmly traced to mythology from antiquity, and they have found analogues in ancient texts that could be designated as lamiai (or lamiae) which are part-serpent beings.

She is also attested in Bath, England, where an altar to her was dedicated by a man of the Gallic Treveri people. Her name is derived from the Celtic root nemeto-, referring to consecrated religious spaces, particularly sacred groves. She has thus been taken to be a guardian goddess of open-air places of worship. The same root is found in the names of the Romano-British goddess Arnemetia and the Matres Nemetiales (known from an inscription in Grenoble). Surviving inscriptions often associate Nemetona with Mars (sometimes given the Celtic name Loucetius). She is paired with Loucetius Mars in the inscription at Bath, and with Mars at Trier and Altrip.",
  "/wiki/Hercules": "Hercules (/\u02c8h\u025c\u02d0rkjuli\u02d0z, -j\u0259-/) is a Roman hero and god. He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles, who was the son of Zeus (Roman equivalent Jupiter) and the mortal Alcmene. In classical mythology, Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures. The Romans adapted the Greek hero's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name Hercules. In later Western art and literature and in popular culture, Hercules is more commonly used than Heracles as the name of the hero. Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him. This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the later tradition.",
  "/wiki/Ogmios": "Ogmios (also known as Ogmius; Ancient Greek: \u1f4c\u03b3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; Latin: Ogmius, Ogimius) was the  Celtic deity of eloquence. He looked like an older version of Heracles who would use his powers of persuasion to bind men to himself. Most of the knowledge about Ogmios comes from comparisons between him and powerful deities and heroes in other ancient cultures.",
  "/wiki/Ogma": "Ogma (modern spelling: Oghma) is a god from Irish and Scottish mythology. A member of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, he is often considered a deity and may be related to the Gallic god Ogmios. According to the Ogam Tract, he is the inventor of Ogham, the script in which Irish Gaelic was first written.",
  "/wiki/Maia_(mythology)": "Maia (/\u02c8me\u026a.\u0259/ or /\u02c8ma\u026a.\u0259/; Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1; Latin: Maia), in ancient Greek religion, is one of the Pleiades and the mother of Hermes. Maia is the daughter of Atlas and Pleione the Oceanid, and is the oldest of the seven Pleiades. They were born on  Mount Cyllene in Arcadia, and are sometimes called mountain nymphs, oreads; Simonides of Ceos sang of mountain Maia (Maiados oureias) of the lovely black eyes. Because they were daughters of Atlas, they were also called the Atlantides.",
  "/wiki/Rosmerta": "In Gallo-Roman religion, Rosmerta was a goddess of fertility and abundance, her attributes being those of plenty such as the cornucopia. Rosmerta is attested by statues, and by inscriptions. In Gaul she was often depicted with the Roman god Mercury as her consort, but is sometimes found independently.",
  "/wiki/Hygieia": "In Greek as well as Roman mythology, Hygieia (also Hygiea or Hygeia; Ancient Greek: \u1f59\u03b3\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 or \u1f59\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, Latin: Hyg\u0113a or Hyg\u012ba), was one of the Asclepiadae; the sons and daughters of the god of medicine, Asclepius, and his wife Epione. Hygieia was the goddess/personification of health (Greek: \u1f51\u03b3\u03af\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 - hugieia), cleanliness and hygiene. Hygieia and her four sisters each performed a facet of Apollo's art: Hygieia (health, cleanliness, and sanitation); Panacea (universal remedy); Iaso (recuperation from illness); Aceso (the healing process); and Agla\u00efa (beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment). Hygieia also played an important part in her father's cult. While her father was more directly associated with healing, she was associated with the prevention of sickness and the continuation of good health. Her name is the source of the word hygiene. Hygieia was imported by the Romans as the goddess Valetudo, the goddess of personal health, but in time she started to be increasingly identified with the ancient Italian goddess of social welfare, Salus.",
  "/wiki/Sirona": "In Celtic polytheism, Sirona was a goddess worshipped predominantly in East Central Gaul and along the Danubian limes. A healing deity, she was associated with healing springs; her attributes were snakes and eggs. She was sometimes depicted with Apollo Grannus or Apollo Borvo.

  "/wiki/Silvanus_(mythology)": "Silvanus (/s\u026al\u02c8ve\u026an\u0259s/; meaning of the woods in Latin) was a Roman tutelary deity of woods and fields. As protector of the forest (sylvestris deus), he especially presided over plantations and delighted in trees growing wild. He is also described as a god watching over the fields and husbandmen, protecting in particular the boundaries of fields. The similarly named Etruscan deity Selvans may be a borrowing of Silvanus, or not even related in origin. Silvanus is described as the divinity protecting the flocks of cattle, warding off wolves, and promoting their fertility. Dolabella, a rural engineer of whom only a few pages are known, states that Silvanus was the first to set up stones to mark the limits of fields, and that every estate had three Silvani:",
  "/wiki/Sucellus": "In Gallo-Roman religion, Sucellus /su\u02d0\u02c8s\u025bl\u0259s/ or Sucellos was a deity depicted as carrying a large mallet (also described as a hammer) and also an olla and/or barrel. Originally a Celtic deity, his cult flourished not only among Gallo-Romans, but also to some extent among the neighbouring peoples of Raetia and Britain. He has been associated with agriculture and wine, particularly in the territory of the Aedui.",
  "/wiki/Dagda": "The Dagda (Irish: An Dagda) is an important god in Irish mythology. One of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the Dagda is portrayed as a father-figure, king, and druid. He is associated with fertility, agriculture, manliness and strength, as well as magic, druidry and wisdom. He can control life and death, the weather and crops, as well as time and the seasons. He is often described as a large bearded man or giant wearing a hooded cloak. He owns a magic staff, club, or mace (the lorg m\u00f3r or lorg anfaid) which kills with one end and brings to life with the other, a cauldron (the coire ansic) which never runs empty, and a magic harp (uaithne) which can control men's emotions and change the seasons.

From the second century BC onward, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena, though the Romans did not stress her relation to battle and warfare as the Greeks did. Following the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of Metis, who had been swallowed by Jupiter, and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armor. Jupiter forcibly impregnated the titaness Metis, which resulted in her attempting to change shape (or shapeshift) to escape him. Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had Saturn, and in turn, Saturn had Caelus. Fearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body. In some versions of the story, Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind as the source of his wisdom.",
  "/wiki/Sulis": "In localised Celtic polytheism practised in Great Britain, Sulis was a deity worshipped at the thermal spring of Bath (now in Somerset). She was worshipped by the Romano-British as Sulis Minerva, whose votive objects and inscribed lead tablets suggest that she was conceived of both as a nourishing, life-giving mother goddess, and as an effective agent of curses wished by her votaries.",
  "/wiki/Belisama": "In Celtic polytheism, Belisama (epigraphically B\u03b7\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1) was a goddess worshipped in Gaul. She is identified with Minerva in the interpretatio romana. The etymology of her name has been taken to translate to brightest one, i.e. containing a superlative suffix -isama attached to the root bel bright; based on this she has also been speculatively claimed as companion of Belenus, whose name seems to contain the same root. But the root bel has also (for either deity) been interpreted differently, e.g. as bel strong.",
  "/wiki/Senuna": "Senuna was a Celtic goddess worshipped in Roman Britain. She was unknown until a cache of 26 votive offerings to her were discovered in 2002 in an undisclosed field at Ashwell End in Hertfordshire by metal detectorist Alan Meek. Her imagery shows evidence of syncretism between a pre-Roman goddess with the Roman Minerva (for a parallel, cf. Sulis Minerva, the Romano-British goddess worshipped at Bath). Senuna's shrine consisted of a ritual midden, onto which offerings were thrown, surrounded by a complex of buildings including workshops and accommodation for pilgrims. It was certainly no humble crossroads shrine. The dedicatory artefacts kept in the shrine were subsequently buried together on the edge of the midden, perhaps intended for temporary safe-keeping, in the late 3rd or 4th century CE.",
  "/wiki/Coventina": "Coventina was a Romano-British goddess of wells and springs. She is known from multiple inscriptions at one site in Northumberland county of  England, an area surrounding a wellspring near Carrawburgh on Hadrian's Wall. It is possible that other inscriptions, two from Hispania and one from Narbonensis, refer to Coventina, but this is disputed.",
  "/wiki/Icovellauna": "Icovellauna was a Celtic goddess worshipped in Gaul. Her places of worship included an octagonal temple at Le Sablon in Metz, originally built over a spring, from which five inscriptions dedicated to her have been recovered; and Trier, where Icovellauna was honoured in an inscription in the Altbachtal temple complex. [A] Both of these places lie in the valley of the Moselle river of eastern Gaul, in what are now Lorraine in France and Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. One such inscription was, somewhat unusually, inscribed on a copper tablet in Roman cursive letters. At the temple in Metz, a spiral staircase led down to the water level, allowing worshippers to leave offerings in the spring and/or to take the waters. A statuette of a local Gaulish Mercury was among the ex-votos deposited at the shrine, which also included coins and ceramics dating from the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. Jeanne-Marie Demarolle states that Apollo was also associated with Icovellauna. Demarolle glosses the name Icovellauna as \u201cbonne fontaine\u201d or \u2018good fountain\u2019.",
  "/wiki/Sequana": "In Gallo-Roman religion, Sequana was the goddess of the river Seine, particularly the springs at the source of the Seine, and the Gaulish tribe the Sequani. The springs, called the Fontes Sequanae (The Springs of Sequana), are located in a valley in the Ch\u00e2tillon Plateau, to the north-west of Dijon in Burgundy, and it was here, in the 2nd or 1st century BC, that a healing shrine was established. The sanctuary was later taken over by the Romans, who built two temples, a colonnaded precinct and other related structures centred on the spring and pool. Many dedications were made to Sequana at her temple, including a large pot inscribed with her name and filled with bronze and silver models of parts of human bodies to be cured by her. Wooden and stone images of limbs, internal organs, heads, and complete bodies were offered to her in the hope of a cure, as well as numerous coins and items of jewellery. Respiratory illnesses and eye diseases were common. Pilgrims were frequently depicted as carrying offerings to the goddess, including money, fruit, or a favorite pet dog or bird.",

Much like a guardian angel, the genius would follow each man from the hour of his birth until the day he died. For women, it was the Juno spirit that would accompany each of them.",
  "/wiki/Suleviae": "In ancient Celtic religion, Sulevia was a goddess worshipped in Gaul, Britain, and Galicia,  very often in the plural forms Suleviae or (dative) Sule(v)is. Dedications to Sulevia(e) are attested in about forty inscriptions, distributed quite widely in the Celtic world, but with particular concentrations in Noricum, among the Helvetii, along the Rhine, and also in Rome. Jufer and Luginb\u00fchl distinguish the Suleviae from another group of plural Celtic goddesses, the Matres, and interpret the name Suleviae as meaning those who govern well. The Suleviae have been identified in one inscription with the Junones, but mostly with the Matres, for example on an inscription from Roman Colchester, as well as on most of the inscriptions from Rome. The Colchester inscription reads:"
