Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma before beginning his career as a film maker. Chabrol's career began with Le Beau Serge (1958), inspired by Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in Les Biches (1968), La Femme infid\u00e8le (1969), and Le Boucher (1970) \u2013 all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran, who was his wife at the time. Sometimes characterized as a mainstream New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozi\u00e8re. On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary (1991) and La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie (1996).",
