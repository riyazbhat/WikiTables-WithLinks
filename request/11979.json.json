  "/wiki/Second": "The second (symbol: s, abbreviation: sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI), commonly understood and historically defined as \u200b1\u204486400 of a day \u2013 this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each. Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds (and minutes), and a \"second hand\" to mark the passage of time in seconds.  Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for velocity, meters per second per second for acceleration, and per second for frequency.",
  "/wiki/Planck_time": "In quantum mechanics, the Planck time (tP) is the unit of time in the system of natural units known as Planck units. A Planck time unit is the time required for light to travel a distance of 1 Planck length in a vacuum, which is a time interval of approximately 5.39 \u00d7 10\u221244 s. The unit is named after Max Planck, who was the first to propose it.",
  "/wiki/Quantum_gravity": "Quantum gravity (QG) is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics, and where quantum effects cannot be ignored, such as near compact astrophysical objects where the effects of gravity are strong.",
  "/wiki/Natural_units": "In physics, natural units are physical units of measurement based only on universal physical constants. For example, the elementary charge e is a natural unit of electric charge, and the speed of light c is a natural unit of speed. A purely natural system of units has all of its units defined in this way, and usually such that the numerical values of the selected physical constants in terms of these units are exactly 1. These constants are then typically omitted from mathematical expressions of physical laws, and while this has the apparent advantage of simplicity, it may entail a loss of clarity due to the loss of information for dimensional analysis. It precludes the interpretation of an expression in terms of fundamental physical constants, such as e and c, unless it is known which units (in dimensionful units) the expression is supposed to have. In this case, the reinsertion of the correct powers of e, c, etc., can be uniquely determined.",

It consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon energy. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation gamma rays based on their relatively strong penetration of matter; in 1900 he had already named two less penetrating types of decay radiation (discovered by Henri Becquerel) alpha rays and beta rays in ascending order of penetrating power.",
  "/wiki/Atomic_nucleus": "The atomic nucleus is the small, dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom, discovered in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford based on the 1909 Geiger\u2013Marsden gold foil experiment.  After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Dmitri Ivanenko and Werner Heisenberg.  An atom is composed of a positively-charged nucleus, with a cloud of negatively-charged electrons surrounding it, bound together by electrostatic force.  Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus, with a very small contribution from the electron cloud.  Protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear force.",
  "/wiki/Electronvolt": "In physics, an electronvolt (symbol eV, also written electron-volt and electron volt) is the amount of kinetic energy gained (or lost) by a single electron accelerating from rest through an electric potential difference of one volt in vacuum.

  "/wiki/Zitterbewegung": "Zitterbewegung (\"trembling motion\" in German) is a predicted rapid oscillatory motion of elementary particles that obey relativistic wave equations.  The existence of such motion was first proposed by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1930 as a result of his analysis of the wave packet solutions of the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons in free space, in which an interference between positive and negative energy states produces what appears to be a fluctuation (up to the speed of light) of the position of an electron around the median, with an angular frequency of 2mc2/\u210f, or approximately 1.6\u00d71021 radians per second. For the hydrogen atom, zitterbewegung can be invoked as a heuristic way to derive the Darwin term, a small correction of the energy level of the s-orbitals.",
  "/wiki/Electron": "The electron  is a subatomic particle, symbol e\u2212 or \u03b2\u2212, whose electric charge is negative one elementary charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure.  The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \u0127. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de Broglie wavelength for a given energy.",

The name combines the SI prefix nano- (from the Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, nanos, \"dwarf\") with the parent unit name metre (from Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, metr\u03bfn, \"unit of measurement\").  It can be written in scientific notation as 1\u00d710\u22129\u00a0m, in engineering notation as 1 E\u22129 m, and as simply 1/1000000000 metres.

  "/wiki/Ultraviolet": "Ultraviolet  (UV) is electromagnetic radiation with wavelength from 10 nm  to 400 nm, shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation is present in sunlight, and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. It is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights, such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, it can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Consequently, the chemical and biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.",

Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob L\u00f6wig (in 1825) and Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (\"stench\"), referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.",

The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems. Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human interaction, and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping. Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for final end use application.

However, Europe retains its status as a full continent because of its great size and the weight of history and tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world."
