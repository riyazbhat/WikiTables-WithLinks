He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement. During his early career as a film critic, Godard criticized mainstream French cinema's Tradition of Quality, which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation. In response, he and like-minded critics began to make their own films. Many of Godard's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema. In 1964, Godard described his and his colleagues' impact: We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV. He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s; his approach in film conventions, politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave. Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references, several of his films expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy.",
