It is New York City's most populous borough, with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010. Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen, it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island. Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River, and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island. With a land area of 70.82 square miles (183.4 km2) and water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), Kings County is New York state's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area, though it is the second-largest among the city's five boroughs. If each borough were ranked as a city, Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S., after Los Angeles and Chicago. Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution) until January 1, 1898, when, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal Charter of \"Greater New York\", Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities, boroughs, and counties to form the modern City of New York, surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs. The borough continues, however, to maintain a distinct culture.",

Consequently, tracks from the album were performed live as early as 2007, but recording was not completed until July 2009, following an entire album's worth of material being scrapped by the band.\n The singles include: \"It's Not the End of the World, But I Can See It from Here\", \"Where We Belong\" and \"For He's a Jolly Good Felon\". \"A Better Nothing\" was set to be the fourth single, but it was cancelled due to the poor charting of \"For He's a Jolly Good Felon\". Although drummer Ilan Rubin left the band before the album's release, his drum tracks were still kept on the finalized product.",
  "/wiki/Weapons_(album)": "Weapons is the fifth and final studio album by the Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets. It was released through Epic Records on 2 April 2012. It was the first and only record featuring Luke Johnson on drums, after being with two other drummers previously, Mike Chiplin and Ilan Rubin (the latter of whom features in archive recordings included on the \"deluxe edition\" of Weapons, as well as the hidden track \"Weapon\" on all versions of the album). This was the last album to be released by the band before lead vocalist Ian Watkins was convicted of numerous sex offences, which led to their disbandment.\n Just like their third studio album it features Latin on the front, which reads deus velox nex. When translated it reads God is swift death.",
