The 17th Dynasty dates approximately from 1580 to 1550 BC. Its mainly Theban rulers are contemporary with the Hyksos of the  Fifteenth Dynasty and succeed the Sixteenth Dynasty, which was also based in Thebes.\n In March 2012, French archeologists examining a limestone door in the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak discovered hieroglyphs with the name Senakhtenre, the first evidence of this king dating to his lifetime.\n The last two kings of the dynasty opposed the Hyksos rule over Egypt and initiated a war that would rid Egypt of the Hyksos kings and began a period of unified rule, the New Kingdom of Egypt.\n Kamose, the second son of Seqenenre Tao and last king of the Seventeenth Dynasty, was the brother of Ahmose I, the first king of the Eighteenth Dynasty.",

He probably was the son and successor to Senakhtenre Ahmose and Queen Tetisheri. The dates of his reign are uncertain, but he may have risen to power in the decade ending in 1560 BC or in 1558 BC (based on the probable accession date of his son, Ahmose I, the first ruler of the eighteenth dynasty, see Egyptian chronology). With his queen, Ahhotep I, Seqenenre Tao fathered two pharaohs, Kamose, his immediate successor who was the last pharaoh of the seventeenth dynasty, and Ahmose I who, following a regency by his mother, was the first pharaoh of the eighteenth. Seqenenre Tao is credited with starting the opening moves in a war of revanchism against Hyksos incursions into Egypt, which saw the country completely liberated during the reign of his son Ahmose I.",

In the early dynasty, ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles, the Horus, the Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj) name, and the Two Ladies (nbtj) name. The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added. In Egyptian society, religion was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people. The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods; his role was both as civil and religious administrator. He owned all of the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army. Religiously, the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples.",

Gaston Maspero had doubts about the identity of the mummy, but Grafton Elliot Smith points out in his description of the royal mummies that the method of mummification is consistent with that of the 18th Dynasty. The remains are those of an old woman who was relatively short in stature. The examination of her mummy shows that she suffered a head wound prior to her death which has the characteristics of wound sustained when falling backwards.

During his reign, Ahmose completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the Nile Delta, restored Theban rule over the whole of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan.

Her mummified remains were discovered in a Theban tomb in 1881 and she is estimated to have been in her 30s at the time of her death. The mummy was unwrapped by Grafton Elliot Smith in 1909. He distinguished her mummy as the most perfect example of embalming that has come down to us from the time of the early 18'th Dynasty, or perhaps even of any period. He further characterized her as the least unlovely of the existing female mummies, and described as a slim, gracefully-built woman, measuring 1m 510mm in height, with small childlike hands.  \n In 2009, a CAT scan by a medical team revealed Lady Rai had a diseased aortic arch and is thus the oldest known mummy with evidence of atherosclerosis.\n The mummy of Ahmose Inhapy, a princess and queen of the late 17th dynasty of Egypt who was aunt to Ahmose-Nefertari, was found in the outer coffin of Lady Rai.",

He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years. Although his reign is poorly documented, it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence. He inherited the kingdom formed by his father's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant. He continued the rebuilding of   temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his   tomb from his mortuary temple, setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom.",
