It borrows extensively, in all aspects, from Arabic and Persian and its speakers used the (Perso-Arabic) Ottoman Turkish alphabet for written communications. During the peak of Ottoman power (c. 16th century CE), words of foreign origin in Turkish literature in the Ottoman empire heavily outnumbered native Turkish words, with Arabic and Persian vocabulary accounting for up to 88% of the Ottoman vocabulary in some texts. \n Consequently, Ottoman Turkish was largely unintelligible to the less-educated lower-class and to rural Turks, who continued to use kaba T\u00fcrk\u00e7e (\"raw/vulgar Turkish\"; compare Vulgar Latin), which used far fewer foreign loanwords and is the basis of the modern Turkish language.

In 1928, as one of Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet.\n The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination. The basic word order of Turkish is subject\u2013object\u2013verb. Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender. The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T\u2013V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness, social distance, age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee.

The Empire was at first divided into provinces called eyalets, presided over by a Pasha of three tails (feathers borne on a state officer's ceremonial staff). The Grand Vizier was responsible for nominating all the high officers of State, both in the capital and the provinces. Between 1861 and 1866, these Eyalets were abolished, and the territory was divided for administrative purposes into Vilayets.\n The eyalets were subdivided into districts called livas or sanjaks, each of which was under the charge of a Pasha of one tail, with the title of Mira-lira, or Sanjak-bey. These provinces were usually called pashaliks by Europeans. The pasha was invested with powers of absolute government within his province, being the chief of both the military and financial departments, as well as police and criminal justice.\n At official functions, the order of precedence was Egypt, Baghdad, Abyssinia, Buda, Anatolia, \"Mera'ish\", and the Capitan Pasha in Asia and Buda, Egypt, Abyssinia, Baghdad, and Rumelia in Europe, with the remainder arranged according to the chronological order of their conquest."
