  "/wiki/Topographic_prominence": "In topography, prominence[a] measures the height of a mountain or hill's summit relative to the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it. It is a measure of the independence of a summit. A peak's key col (highest gap between two mountains) is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain, selected according to various criteria.",

  "/wiki/Alps": "The Alps (/\u00e6lps/; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [\u02c8alpn\u0329] (listen); Italian: Alpi [\u02c8alpi]; Romansh: Alps; Slovene: Alpe [\u02c8\u00e1\u02d0lp\u025b]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe,[note 1] and stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750\u00a0mi) across eight Alpine countries (from west to east): France, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening  caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French\u2013Italian border, and at 4,810\u00a0m (15,781\u00a0ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres (13,000\u00a0ft).",
