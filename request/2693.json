  "/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp": "The Auschwitz concentration camp (Konzentrationslager Auschwitz) was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust. It consisted of Auschwitz I, the main camp (Stammlager) in O\u015bwi\u0119cim; Auschwitz II-Birkenau, a concentration and extermination camp built with several gas chambers; Auschwitz III-Monowitz, a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben; and dozens of subcamps. The camps became a major site of the Nazis' Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\n After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939, the Schutzstaffel (SS) converted Auschwitz I, an army barracks, into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners. The first inmates, German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries, established the camp's reputation for sadism, beating, torturing, and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons. The first gassings\u2014of Soviet and Polish prisoners\u2014took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941. Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month, and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers. Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz, 1.1 million died. The death toll includes 960,000 Jews (865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival), 74,000 non-Jewish Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and up to 15,000 other Europeans. Those not gassed died of starvation, exhaustion, disease, individual executions, or beatings. Others were killed during medical experiments.\n At least 802 prisoners tried to escape, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944 two Sonderkommando units, consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers, launched an unsuccessful uprising. Only 789 staff (no more than 15 percent) ever stood trial; several, including camp commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss, were executed. The Allies' failure to act on early reports of atrocities in the camp by bombing it or its railways remains controversial.\n As the Soviet Red Army approached Auschwitz in January 1945, toward the end of the war, the SS sent most of the camp's population west on a death march to camps inside Germany and Austria. Soviet troops entered the camp on 27 January 1945, a day commemorated since 2005 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the decades after the war, survivors such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, and Elie Wiesel wrote memoirs of their experiences, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947 Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.",

The camp was established and operated solely by the governing Usta\u0161e regime rather than by Nazi Germany as in the rest of occupied Europe. It was one of the largest concentration camps in Europe and it has been referred to as \"the Auschwitz of the Balkans\" and \"the Yugoslav Auschwitz\".\n It was established in August 1941 in marshland at the confluence of the Sava and Una rivers near the village of Jasenovac, and was dismantled in April 1945. It was \"notorious for its barbaric practices and the large number of victims\".\n In Jasenovac the majority of victims were ethnic Serbs (as part of the Genocide of the Serbs); others were Jews (The Holocaust), Roma (The Porajmos), and some political dissidents. Jasenovac was a complex of five subcamps spread over 210\u00a0km2 (81\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) on both banks of the Sava and Una rivers. The largest camp was the \"Brickworks\" camp at Jasenovac, about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southeast of Zagreb. The overall complex included the Stara Gradi\u0161ka sub-camp, the killing grounds across the Sava river at Donja Gradina, five work farms, and the U\u0161tica Roma camp.\n During and since World War II, there has been much debate and controversy regarding the number of victims killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp complex during its more than three-and-a-half years of operation. After the war, a figure of 700,000 reflected the \"conventional wisdom\", although estimates have gone as high as 1.4 million. The authorities of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia conducted a population survey in 1964 that resulted in a list of 59,188 victims of Jasenovac and Stara Gradi\u0161ka, the findings were not published until 1989. Croatian academic Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107 published books in 1989 and 1992 in which he \"meticulously analysed the available data\" and concluded that some 83,000 people had been killed at Jasenovac. His findings were criticized by the director of the Museum of Victims of Genocide in Belgrade, Milan Bulaji\u0107, who defended his figure of 1.1 million, although his rebuttal was later dismissed as having \"no scholarly value\". Since Bulaji\u0107's retirement from his post in 2002, the Museum has no longer defended the figure of 700,000 to 1 million victims of the camp. In 2005, Dragan Cvetkovi\u0107, a researcher from the Museum, and a Croatian co-author published a book on wartime losses in the NDH which gave a figure of approximately 100,000 victims of Jasenovac.\n The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington, D.C. presently estimates that the Usta\u0161a regime murdered between 77,000 and 99,000 people in Jasenovac between 1941 and 1945, comprising; \"between 45,000 and 52,000 Serbs; between 12,000 and 20,000 Jews; between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma (Gypsies); and between 5,000 and 12,000 ethnic Croats and Muslims, political and religious opponents of the regime.\" The Jasenovac Memorial Site quotes a similar figure of between 80,000 and 100,000 victims.",

  "/wiki/Theresienstadt_concentration_camp": "Theresienstadt (Czech: Terez\u00edn [\u02c8t\u025br\u025bzi\u02d0n]) was a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto established by the SS during World War II in the fortress town Terez\u00edn, located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (a German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia). Theresienstadt served two main purposes: it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps, and a \"retirement settlement\" for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution. Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners, and the ghetto also served a propaganda role. Unlike other ghettos, the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant.\n The ghetto was established by a transport of Czech Jews in November 1941. The first German and Austrian Jews arrived in June 1942; Dutch and Danish Jews came beginning in 1943 and prisoners of a wide variety of nationalities were sent to Theresienstadt in the last months of the war. About 33,000 people died at Theresienstadt, mostly from malnutrition and disease. More than 88,000 people were held there for months or years before being deported to extermination camps and other killing sites; the Jewish self-administration's role in choosing those to be deported has attracted significant controversy. Including 4,000 of the deportees who survived, the total number of survivors was around 23,000.\n Theresienstadt was known for its relatively rich cultural life, including concerts, lectures, and clandestine education for children. The fact that it was governed by a Jewish self-administration as well as the large number of \"prominent\" Jews imprisoned there facilitated the flourishing of cultural life. This spiritual legacy has attracted the attention of scholars and sparked interest in the ghetto. In the postwar period, a few of the SS perpetrators and Czech guards were put on trial, but the ghetto was generally forgotten by the Soviet authorities. The Terez\u00edn Ghetto Museum is visited by 250,000 people each year.",

  "/wiki/F\u00fcrstengrube_subcamp": "The F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp was organized in the summer of 1943 at the F\u00fcrstengrube hard coal mine in the town of Weso\u0142a (Wessolla) near Myslowice (Myslowitz), approximately 30 kilometers (19\u00a0mi) from Auschwitz concentration camp. The mine, which IG Farbenindustrie AG acquired in February 1941, was to supply hard coal for the IG Farben factory being built in Auschwitz. Besides the old F\u00fcrstengrube mine, called the Altanlage, a new mine (F\u00fcrstengrube-Neuanlage) had been designed and construction had begun; it was to provide for greater coal output in the future. Coal production at the new mine was anticipated to start in late 1943, so construction was treated as very urgent; however, that plan proved to be unfeasible.\n In the period before the Auschwitz concentration camp prisoners were sent to work at F\u00fcrstengrube, the mine employed Soviet prisoners of war, Jewish slave laborers, and forced laborers from the USSR in addition to its regular staff. Negotiations in July 1943 between Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss and representatives of IG Farbenindustrie AG and F\u00fcrstengrube GmbH, led to an agreement to build a new camp for approximately 600 prisoners\u2014increasing to 1,200-1,300 later\u2014from Auschwitz.\n Mainly Jews built the new camp. They lived in the mine's forced-labor camp for Jews, which was under the so-called Organisation Schmelt; that camp was called Lager Ostland. The Jewish prisoners from that camp were taken away even before the prisoners were moved from the Auschwitz concentration camp. The camp report for August 1943 no longer mentions the number of Jews employed. The prisoners moved from Auschwitz then continued the subcamp's construction and expansion.\n In early September 1943, the SS began moving prisoners, probably including a few German prisoner foremen, from Auschwitz to the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp, which appears as \"Lager S\u00fcd\" on mine maps. On September 4, 1943, the Auschwitz labor office reported that 129 prisoners were working at the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp; by July 1944 that number had risen to approximately 1,200, 85 to 90 percent of whom were Jews. Polish Jews were the most numerous group, but Jews from Germany, Austria, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Greece were also present. Starting in the spring of 1944, there were also several dozen non-Jewish Polish prisoners at F\u00fcrstengrube.\n For the first three months, the subcamp was under the direct charge of Auschwitz headquarters; after November 22, 1943, under Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Effective May 22, 1944, the 3rd Guard Company of Auschwitz III took charge of the guard duty. SS Master Sergeant Otto Moll was named the subcamp's first commandant; he served in that position until March 1944. SS Technical Sergeant Max Schmidt succeeded Moll until the subcamp was shut down in January 1945. The SS staff at the beginning of 1944 consisted of 47 SS men and grew to 64 at the end of the year.\n Prisoners from Auschwitz who went to the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp were mostly put to work extracting coal in the old mine and building the new one. Prisoners working in the old mine were divided up into three shifts: morning (5 a.m. to 1 p.m.), day (1 p.m. to 9 p.m.), and night (9 p.m. to 5 a.m.). Work at the mine was especially difficult and dangerous because of the low galleries and the abundance of water. Prisoners did not receive the required protective clothing and they were constantly vulnerable to beatings and abuse from the mine's civilian staff as well as prisoner-foremen. The prisoners building the new mine faced equally brutal and exhausting work. They worked in one shift, a day shift, doing all sorts of construction and assembly jobs in groups of painters, bricklayers, welders, metalworkers, and assemblers. Additionally, when the shifts were over, many of the prisoners then had to work to expand the camp.\n Only very sick prisoners were admitted to the camp infirmary. SS doctors conducted periodic selections there and among the other prisoners as well; prisoners who were no longer able to work were moved to the Birkenau hospital sector (BIIf). The rotation of prisoners was significant as new prisoners replaced those who had been selected. For example, from May 8 to 14, 1944, as many as 42 F\u00fcrstengrube prisoners entered the hospital sector of Birkenau.\n In spite of the hard conditions and fight for survival, despite the beatings and persecution, there were attempts to maintain a cultural life at the subcamp, in the form of band concerts and plays. Some prisoners secretly drew portraits of their fellow inmates.\n Only a few escapes and escape attempts from the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp are known. Gabriel Rothkopf, a Polish Jew, escaped during the night of December 18\u201319, 1943, while returning from work at the old mine. In response, Commandant Moll personally shot a randomly selected group of prisoners in front of their fellows and left their bodies on the assembly ground until the next shift returned. Ivan Potekhnin, a Russian prisoner, escaped on April 15, 1944. In the spring of 1944, a group of prisoners dug a tunnel from a barrack, but during an inspection five German Jews were apprehended in it; they were later hanged. In June 1944, Commandant Schmidt shot a Russian prisoner who intended to escape from the subcamp. In late August 1944, yet another Russian prisoner was shot; he had attempted to escape in a freight car leaving the new mine construction site. The escape attempt of a Polish prisoner named Gorewicz, working in the forge, also ended with his execution.\n Polish miners on the site helped a group of Polish prisoners by smuggling messages, food, and news of the situation on the fronts. However, the camp's political branch got word of the activity, probably in late August 1944. The prisoners were sent to Auschwitz I and, after approximately two months of interrogation, they were brought back to F\u00fcrstengrube and hanged on October 10, 1944.\n In September, November, and December 1944, the Polish and Russian prisoners were moved to the Flossenb\u00fcrg, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen concentration camps. As of January 17, 1945, 1,283 prisoners, chiefly Jews, remained in the subcamp. On January 19, having burnt the camp's records, the SS led approximately 1,000 prisoners out of the camp, headed for Gliwice (Gleiwitz) via Mikolow. Severe cold and icy roads made the march difficult, and SS men killed anyone who fell out. On the evening of January 20, 1945, the F\u00fcrstengrube prisoners reached the Gleiwitz II subcamp, where they joined prisoners from Auschwitz III-Monowitz as well as some other subcamps. The next day, January 21, the SS loaded approximately 4,000 prisoners into open railway cars bound for Mauthausen. The authorities at Mauthausen did not accept the transport, however, as the camp was overcrowded, but sent the train on to Mittelbau (Dora), where it arrived on January 28. Out of 4,000 prisoners, only about 3,500 survived the seven-day trip.\n On January 27, 1945, at about 4:00\u00a0p.m., a dozen or so SS men entered the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp and killed most of the remaining prisoners; some they shot, and some burned to death when the SS set their barracks on fire. Only the sudden arrival of Soviet troops forced the SS to flee, thus sparing a few of the prisoners. A mine employee who was present afterward reported that they buried 239 bodies. About 20 prisoners survived the massacre. One of them, former prisoner Rudolf Ehrlich, testified to these events on May 9, 1945, before the Investigation Commission for German Nazi Crimes at Auschwitz.\n In a United States Military Court trial in Dachau from November 15 to December 13, 1945, Otto Moll, the first commandant of the F\u00fcrstengrube subcamp, was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out on May 28, 1946.",

The Kreiten family originated in the area of the Lower Rhineland, along the current Dutch-German border.\n He made his debut at the age of eleven with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Concerto in A major  in a live broadcast. He was educated in Berlin by Claudio Arrau.\n Kreiten was reported to the Gestapo by Nazi neighbor Ellen Ott-Monecke about making negative remarks about Adolf Hitler and the war effort.

The Einsatzgruppen were involved in the murder of much of the intelligentsia, including members of the priesthood and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\" (Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage) in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars, Jews, and Romani people as well as actual or alleged partisans throughout Eastern Europe.\n Under the direction of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich, the Einsatzgruppen operated in territories occupied by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The Einsatzgruppen worked hand-in-hand with the Order Police battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at Babi Yar with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the Rumbula massacre (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the Wehrmacht cooperated with the Einsatzgruppen, providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen, related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the Holocaust.\n After the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen trial in 1947\u201348, charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes.

It was located in the forest next to the railway station of Sobib\u00f3r within the semi-colonial territory of the General Government in occupied Poland.\n Unlike many other Nazi concentration camps, Sobibor existed for the sole purpose of exterminating Jews. Most new arrivals were immediately sent to the gas chambers, with rare exceptions being made for those who were forced to serve as slave labourers who assisted in the operation of the camp. Some 200,000 to 250,000 people were murdered at Sobibor, making it the fourth deadliest extermination camp after Belzec, Treblinka, and Auschwitz.\n Sobibor is notable for the prisoner revolt which occurred on 14 October 1943, an event which is often described as the most successful revolt ever to have taken place in a Nazi extermination camp. The plan for the revolt, which was developed by Alexander Pechersky and Leon Feldhendler, involved two phases. In the first phase, teams of prisoners were to assassinate all of the on-duty SS officers in discrete locations. In the second phase, all 600 prisoners would assemble for roll call and walk to freedom out the front gate. However, the revolt did not go as planned. The operation was discovered while several SS officers were still alive and prisoners ended up having to escape by climbing over barbed wire fences and running through a mine field under heavy machine gun fire. Even so, about 300 prisoners made it out of the camp, of whom roughly 60 survived to the end of the war. \n After the revolt the Nazis demolished the camp and planted it over with pine trees that concealed the evidence of what had happened there. In the decades after World War Two Sobibor was not well known and the site was rarely visited except by locals digging for buried valuables. Since then it has become better known through its depictions in the TV miniseries Holocaust and the film Escape from Sobibor. The site now hosts the Sobibor Museum as well as ongoing archaeological excavations.\n The Times newspaper reported that 350 wartime photos of Sobibor have recently been discovered. The photos were in albums belonging to Johann Niemann, the camp deputy commandant.

After the Grossaktion Warsaw of summer 1942, in which more than a quarter of a million Jews were deported from the ghetto to Treblinka and murdered, the remaining Jews began to build bunkers and smuggle weapons and explosives into the ghetto. The left-wing Jewish Combat Organization (\u017bOB) and right-wing Jewish Military Union (\u017bZW) formed and began to train. A small resistance effort to another roundup in January 1943 was partially successful and spurred the Polish groups to support the Jews in earnest.\n The uprising started on 19 April when the ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer J\u00fcrgen Stroop, who then ordered the burning of the ghetto, block by block, ending on 16 May. A total of 13,000 Jews died, about half of them burnt alive or suffocated. German casualties were probably less than 150,[citation needed] with Stroop reporting only 110 casualties [16 killed + 1 dead/93 wounded]. It was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II. The Jews knew that the uprising was doomed and their survival was unlikely. Marek Edelman, the only surviving \u017bOB commander, said that the motivation for fighting was \"to pick the time and place of our deaths\". According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the uprising was \"one of the most significant occurrences in the history of the Jewish people\".",
