  "/wiki/Save_percentage": "Save percentage (often known by such symbols as SV%, SVS%, SVP, PCT) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic. In ice hockey and lacrosse, it\u2019s a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops. It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal. Although the statistic is called save percentage, it is given as a decimal (in the same way as an on-base percentage in baseball). Thus, .933 means a goaltender saved 93.3 percent of all shots they faced. National Hockey League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .900, and National Lacrosse League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .750. In ice hockey internationally, a save percentage is expressed as a true percentage (e.g. 90%), not a decimal.",
