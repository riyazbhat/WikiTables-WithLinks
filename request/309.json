  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker (LB or backer) is a playing position in gridiron football.  Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \"back up the line\". Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \"two-point stance\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \"three-point stance\" or \"four-point stance\" before the ball is snapped).\n The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed. Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing. A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap. When a blitz is called by the defense, it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense's quarterback.\n Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense, due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense, when required. Similar to the \"free safety\" position, linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap, to determine their role during that particular play.",

  "/wiki/Lyle_Green": "Lyle Green (born February 4, 1976, in Kitchener, Ontario) is a former gridiron football fullback. He was a member of the BC Lions and Calgary Stampeders. \n Green went to the University of Toledo.  With the Lions he is number 28. Green is 6'1\" and weighs 217 lbs and was drafted by the Lions in the 2001 CFL Draft (1st round, 3rd overall).\n In the 2002 CFL season, Green had career-highs in rushing yards (343, also his only 100+ rushing yard season), touchdowns (3, has only 4 in his career) and carries (60). In the 2004 CFL season, he recorded a career-high in receptions (22) and had 248 receiving yards. In the 2005 CFL season, Green was one of 9 players on BC's offense to start all 18 games. He also had a career-high in receiving yards (261) and recorded the first receiving touchdown of his career.\n In 2006, Green had career-lows in rushing yards (31), receiving yards (35) and average yards in receiving (5.8), but did have a career-high in average yards in rushing (15.5) and helped the Lions win the 94th Grey Cup.\n On June 8, 2009, Green was officially moved to the slotback position by head coach and general manager Wally Buono. This was partly to fill the void left by Jason Clermont leaving the Lions to play in Saskatchewan and also to let younger players like Rolly Lumbala and Alexis Bwenge have a shot to play in the Lions backfield.\n With the emergence of Jamall Lee, Andrew Harris and Jerome Messam as Canadian fullbacks, Green was released on June 24, 2010. Green finished 14th on the all-time list for games played by a BC Lion, with 161 games, which was also the most for a running back with the club.  \n In July 2011, Green returned to the CFL, signing with the Calgary Stampeders.  He made 3 special teams tackles  while playing in 13 games.",
  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback (FB) is a position known as the best position in the game of football, in the offensive backfield in gridiron football, and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback. Typically, fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running, pass catching, and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back.\n Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks, including Jim Brown, Marion Motley, Jim Taylor, Franco Harris, Larry Csonka, John Riggins, Christian Okoye, and Levi Jackson. However, many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks, due to their position as the primary ball carrier; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks. Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott, Daryl Johnston, and Lorenzo Neal.",

  "/wiki/Guard_(American_football)": "In gridiron football, a guard (G) is a player who lines up between the center and the tackles on the offensive line of a football team on the line of scrimmage used primarily for blocking. Right guards (RG) is the term for the guards on the right of the offensive line, while left guards (LG) are on the left side. Guards are to the right or left of the center.\n The guard's job is to protect the quarterback from the incoming linemen during pass plays, as well as creating openings (holes) for the running backs to head through. Guards are automatically considered ineligible receivers, so they cannot intentionally touch a forward pass, unless it is to recover a fumble or is first touched by a defender or eligible receiver.",

Under the modern rules of American football, teams are allowed free substitutions; that is, teams may change any number of players after any play. This has resulted in the development of three \"platoons\" of players: the offense (the team with the ball, which is trying to score), the defense (the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them), and the special teams (who play in kicking situations).
