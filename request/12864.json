In 1882, Conwell came to Pennsylvania to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working-class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules. These students\u2014later dubbed night owls\u2014were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence the origin of the university's name and mascot. By 1907, the institution revised its institutional status and was incorporated as a university.\n As of 2019, about 40,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students were enrolled in more than 600 academic degree programs offered at sites across the globe, including eight campuses across Pennsylvania, Rome and Japan. Temple is among the world's largest providers of professional education (law, medicine, podiatry, pharmacy, dentistry, and architecture), preparing the largest body of professional practitioners in Pennsylvania.\n Temple's sports teams, the Owls, compete in NCAA Division I sporting events.",
