  "/wiki/Tachiyaku": "Tachiyaku (\u7acb\u5f79, alt. tateyaku) is a term used in the Japanese theatrical form kabuki to refer to young adult male roles, and to the actors who play those roles. Though not all tachiyaku roles are heroes, the term does not encompass roles such as villains or comic figures, which form their own separate categories. The hero or chief protagonist of a kabuki play is nearly always a tachiyaku role, and the head of a troupe or acting family typically specializes in these roles.\n The term, which literally means \"standing role\", once was used to refer to all actors, to distinguish them from musicians and chanters, who were called jigata (\u5730\u65b9, lit. \"earth person\", i.e. someone who sits).\n There are two main types of tachiyaku role:",
  "/wiki/Nagauta": "Nagauta (\u9577\u5504), literally \"long song\", is a kind of traditional Japanese music which accompanies the kabuki theater.  It was developed around 1740.
