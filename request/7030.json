  "/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center": "Alta Wind Energy Center (AWEC), also known as Mojave Wind Farm, is the third largest onshore wind energy project in the world. The Alta Wind Energy Center is a wind farm located in Tehachapi Pass of the Tehachapi Mountains, in Kern County, California. As of 2013, it is the largest wind farm in the United States, with a combined installed capacity of 1,550\u00a0MW (2,080,000\u00a0hp). The project, being developed near Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm\u2014 site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s\u2014is \"a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects\".\nSouthern California Edison has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1,500\u00a0MW (2,000,000\u00a0hp) or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the Tehachapi area. The project will \"reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons, which is equivalent to taking 446,000 cars off the road\". A total of 3,000\u00a0MW (4,000,000\u00a0hp) is planned.\n The wind farm was developed by Terra-Gen Power which closed a US$1.2\u00a0billion financing deal in July 2010 with partners that included Citibank, Barclays Capital, and Credit Suisse. After many delays, the first phase began construction in 2010. Financing for additional phases of $650 million was secured in April 2012. Construction of the Alta Wind Energy Center is expected to create more than 3,000\u00a0domestic manufacturing, construction, and maintenance jobs, and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy.

  "/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_States": "Wind power in the United States is a branch of the energy industry that has expanded quickly over the latest several years. For the twelve months through September 2019, 286.6 terawatt-hours were generated by wind power, or 6.94% of all generated electrical energy.\n As of September 2019, the total installed wind power nameplate generating capacity in the United States was 100,125 megawatts (MW). \nThis capacity is exceeded only by China and the European Union. \nThus far, wind power's largest growth in capacity was in 2012, when 11,895 MW of wind power was installed, representing 26.5% of new power capacity.\n By September of 2019, 19 states had over 1,000 MW of installed capacity with 5 states (Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and California) generating over half of all wind energy in the nation. Texas, with over 27,000 MW of capacity, about 16.8% of the state's electricity usage, had the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. state at the end of 2019. \nTexas also had more under construction than any other state currently has installed. \nThe state generating the highest percentage of energy from wind power is Iowa at 40.1% of total energy production, while North Dakota has the most per capita wind generation.\n The Alta Wind Energy Center in California is the largest wind farm in the United States with a capacity of 1,548 MW.\nGE Power is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer."
