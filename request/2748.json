The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin.

  "/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages": "Sino-Tibetan, in a few sources also known as Trans-Himalayan, is a family of more than 400 languages, second only to Indo-European in number of native speakers. The Sino-Tibetan language with the most native speakers is Mandarin Chinese (920 million), although since not all forms of Mandarin are mutually-intelligible, it may be regarded as a complex series of dialect continua. Other Sino-Tibetan languages with large numbers of speakers include Burmese (33 million) and the Tibetic languages (six million). Other languages of the family are spoken in the Himalayas, the Southeast Asian Massif, and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau; the latter group, in most cases,  have only small speech communities, in remote mountain areas, and as such are poorly documented. While most linguists do not include Kra\u2013Dai and Hmong\u2013Mien languages within Sino-Tibetan, Chinese linguists generally do include them.[citation needed]",

Some authors further divide Mandarin, Yue and especially Min. These groups are neither clades nor individual languages defined by mutual intelligibility, but reflect common phonological developments from Middle Chinese.",
