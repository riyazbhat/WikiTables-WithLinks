Currently, the state's 82nd governor is Republican Chris Sununu, who has served since January 5, 2017. \n In New Hampshire, the governor has no term limit of any kind.

The five-member council has a veto over many actions of the governor. Together, the Governor and Executive Council approve contracts with a value of $5,000 or more, approve pardons, and appoint the directors and commissioners, judges, the Attorney General and officers in the National Guard.\n The governor has the sole power to veto bills and to command the National Guard while it is not in federal service.\n To be qualified to be governor, one must be 30 years of age, a registered voter, and domiciled in New Hampshire for at least seven years.",
