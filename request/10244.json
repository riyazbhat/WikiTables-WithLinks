According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 99,685 (making it Iowa's third-largest city).  The city appealed this figure, arguing that the Census Bureau missed a section of residents, and that its total population was more than 100,000. The Census Bureau estimated Davenport's 2018 population to be 102,085.\n Located approximately halfway between Chicago and Des Moines, Davenport is on the border of Iowa across the river from Illinois.

Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide, flat, treeless expanses of America's native prairie landscape.\n The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement, with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production.\n The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style.
