The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries: cursive hiragana (\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a) and angular katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca). Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana (\u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d), which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana. Hentaigana (\u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d, variant kana) are historical variants of modern standard hiragana. In modern Japanese, hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds. Katakana, with a few additions, are also used to write Ainu. Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses (furigana) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule. Each kana character (syllabogram) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language.",

  "/wiki/Saibara": "Saibara (\u50ac\u99ac\u697d) is a genre of accompanied vocal Japanese court music that existed during the Heian period in the Nara and Kyoto regions. It draws from traditional folk music (f\u016bzokuuta (\u98a8\u4fd7\u6b4c)) of the Nara period accompanied by togaku instruments, with the exception of the uchimono (\u6253\u7269, percussion instruments), which are replaced by shakubyoshi (\u7b0f\u62cd\u5b50), wooden sticks used for rhythm. It may have developed out of music to drive horses along, as the Chinese characters that compose its name seem to indicate but, according to German musicologist Eta Harich-Schneider, there are several other theories. Song texts are short and simple in character and describe scenes of life. The repertoire was once estimated at some 400 songs. In the late Nara period the aristocracy became more interested in complex foreign musical imports. Emperor Horikawa (1079-1107), despite the taste for Chinese culture since the Nara period, also cultivated an interest in f\u016bzokuuta. Courtiers sang saibara songs for entertainment.",

  "/wiki/Hanging_scroll": "A hanging scroll is one of the many traditional ways to display and exhibit East Asian painting and calligraphy. The hanging scroll was displayed in a room for appreciation; it is to be distinguished from the handscroll, which was narrower and designed to be viewed flat on a table in sections and then stored away again. Hanging scrolls are generally intended to be displayed for short periods of time and are then rolled up to be tied and secured for storage. The hanging scrolls are rotated according to season or occasion, and such works are never intended to be on permanent display. The painting surface of the paper or silk can be mounted with decorative brocade silk borders. In the composition of a hanging scroll, the foreground is usually at the bottom of the scroll  while the middle and far distances are at the middle and top respectively. The traditional craft involved in creating a hanging scroll is considered an art in itself. Mountings for Chinese paintings can be divided into a few types, such as handscrolls, hanging scrolls, album leaves, and screens amongst others.",

The period marks the governance of the Muromachi or Ashikaga shogunate (Muromachi bakufu or Ashikaga bakufu), which was officially established in 1338 by the first Muromachi sh\u014dgun, Ashikaga Takauji, two years after the brief Kenmu Restoration (1333\u20131336) of imperial rule was brought to a close. The period ended in 1573 when the 15th and last shogun of this line, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was driven out of the capital in Kyoto by Oda Nobunaga. From a cultural perspective, the period can be divided into the Kitayama and Higashiyama periods (later 15th \u2013 early 16th centuries). The early years from 1336 to 1392 of the Muromachi period are known as the Nanboku-ch\u014d or Northern and Southern Court period. This period is marked by the continued resistance of the supporters of Emperor Go-Daigo, the emperor behind the Kenmu Restoration. The years from 1465 to the end of the Muromachi period are also known as the Sengoku period or Warring States period."
