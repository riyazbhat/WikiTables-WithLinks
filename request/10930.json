  "/wiki/Peter_Warlock": "Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 \u2013 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.",

  "/wiki/Lo,_How_a_Rose_E'er_Blooming": "\"Es ist ein Ros entsprungen\" (lit., \"A rose has sprung up\"), is a Christmas carol and Marian Hymn of German origin. It is most commonly translated in English as \"Lo, how a rose e'er blooming\", and is sometimes known as \"A Spotless Rose\" or \"Behold a Rose of Judah\". The rose in the text is a symbolic reference to the Virgin Mary, and the hymn makes reference to the Old Testament prophecies of Isaiah which in Christian interpretation foretell the Incarnation of Christ, and to the Tree of Jesse, a traditional symbol of the lineage of Jesus. Because of its prophetic theme, the song is popular during the Christian season of Advent. The hymn has its roots in an unknown author prior to the 17th century. It first appeared in print in 1599 and has since been published with a varying number of verses and in several different translations. It is most commonly sung to a melody which was harmonized by the German composer Michael Praetorius in 1609. The song's popularity endures today; it has been recorded by modern artists such as Mannheim Steamroller and Sting, and it has appeared in a variety of feature film soundtracks, including Love Story (1970) and The Time Traveler's Wife (2009).",

  "/wiki/List_of_Christmas_carols": "This list of Christmas carols is organized by country, language or culture of origin.  Originally, a \"Christmas carol\" referred to a piece of vocal music in carol form whose lyrics centre on the theme of Christmas or the Christmas season.\n Many traditional Christmas carols focus on the Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus, while others celebrate the Twelve Days of Christmas that range from 25 December to 5 January. As a result, many Christmas Carols can be related to St Stephen's Day (26 December), St John's Day (27 December), Feast of Holy Innocents (28 December), St Sylvester's Day (31 December), and the Epiphany. Examples of this are We Three Kings (an Epiphany song), and Good King Wenceslas (a carol for St. Stephen's Day). Nonetheless, some Christmas Carols, both religious and secular, now regarded as Christmas songs have become associated with the Christmas season even though the lyrics may not specifically refer to Christmas \u2013 for example, Deck the Halls (no religious references) and O Come, O Come, Emmanuel (an Advent chant). Other Christmas songs focus on more secular Christmas themes, such as winter scenes, family gatherings, and Santa Claus (Jingle Bells, O Christmas Tree, Home for the Holidays, Jolly Old St. Nicholas, etc.)."
