Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1950s. AI in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic AI. It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making. During the golden age of video arcade games, the idea of AI opponents was largely popularized, which sported an increasing difficulty level, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent on hash functions based on the player's input.[citation needed] Modern games often implement existing techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the actions of NPCs. AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation.",
