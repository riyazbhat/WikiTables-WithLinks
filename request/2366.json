  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area. The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area, and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas. In sociology, population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race. Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations. Population, in a more simple term, is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).",
