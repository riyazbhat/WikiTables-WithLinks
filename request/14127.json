Having been founded according to legend by an unknown priest in 1104, it is one of the few extant religious institutions in the area to predate the advent of Minamoto no Yoritomo, who arrived here in 1181. Like all other Tenjin shrines in Japan, it enshrines the spirit of famous scholar and politician Sugawara no Michizane under the name Tenjin. For this reason, the kami is believed to be a protector of intellectual pursuits.\n Having been unjustly sent into exile, where he died, Michizane was deified and enshrined to pacify his soul, which was believed to be angry as a consequence. Numerous calamities that followed his death validated this belief.\n The shrine, described as \"in bad shape\" a century ago by Iso Mutsu, has been completely rebuilt and consists of an oratory (haiden) and of a sacrarium (honden).

  "/wiki/Honden": "In Shinto shrine architecture, the honden (\u672c\u6bbf, main hall), also called shinden (\u795e\u6bbf), or sometimes sh\u014dden (\u6607\u6bbf) as in Ise Shrine's case, is the most sacred building at a Shinto shrine, intended purely for the use of the  enshrined kami, usually symbolized by a mirror or sometimes by a statue. The building is normally in the rear of the shrine and closed to the general public. In front of it usually stands the haiden, or oratory. The haiden is often connected to the honden by a heiden, or hall of offerings.\n Physically, the honden is the heart of the shrine complex, connected to the rest of the shrine but usually raised above it, and protected from public access by a fence called tamagaki. It usually is relatively small and with a gabled roof. Its doors are usually kept closed, except at religious festivals. Shinto priests themselves enter only to perform rituals. The rite of opening those doors is itself an important part of the shrine's life. Inside the honden is kept the go-shintai (\u5fa1\u795e\u4f53), literally, \"the sacred body of the kami\". The go-shintai is actually not divine, but just a temporary repository of the enshrined kami.\n Important as it is, the honden may sometimes be completely absent, as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated, or when there are nearby himorogi (enclosure) or other yorishiro (substitute object) that serve as a more direct bond to a kami. \u014cmiwa Shrine in Nara, for example, contains no sacred images or objects because it is believed to serve the mountain on which it stands (Mount Miwa). For the same reason, it has a haiden (\u62dd\u6bbf, worship hall), but no honden. In this sense, it is a model of what the first Shinto shrines were like.\n Another important shrine without a honden is Suwa Taisha, head of the Suwa shrine network.\n The honden's structure determines the shrine's architectural style. Many exist, but three (taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri) are of particular importance because they are the only ones believed to predate the arrival of Buddhism, and have therefore a special architectural and historical significance. They are exemplified respectively by the honden at Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha. German architect Bruno Taut compared the importance of Ise Shrine's honden to that of Greece's Parthenon. For details, see the article Shinto architecture.",

The city was therefore a natural fortress and, according to the Azuma Kagami, it was chosen by Minamoto no Yoritomo as his base specifically for this reason. The name itself seems to have been modeled on that of Kyoto's Seven Entrances (\u4eac\u90fd\u4e03\u53e3)\u2014sometimes translated as the seven \"mouths\"\u2014which first appears in the literature of the intermediate Muromachi period (around the year 1450). Together with the other \"numbered\" names like \"Kamakura's Ten Wells\" and \"Kamakura's Ten Bridges\", the modern \"Seven Entrances\" is an Edo period invention probably concocted to stimulate tourism. The Azuma Kagami calls them simply -zaka: Kobukurozaka, Daibutsuzaka, Gokurakuzaka, etc. Besides these seven, there were always other mountain roads that connected Kamakura with, for example, Kotsubo and Shichirigahama. There is one, for example, that connects Kaiz\u014d-ji in \u014cgigayatsu with Kita-Kamakura Station. The Seven Entrances were simply the most convenient and important.\n While economically vital because they allowed traffic to and from the outside world, the Seven Passes had also great military value, and as such they were fortified in various ways, for example narrowing them further until a horse could barely pass through, and obstructing the view of incomers. The roads were also modified adding artificial cliffs and forts from which archers could hit enemies below.",
