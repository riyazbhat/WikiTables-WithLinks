  "/wiki/Bourne_End,_Hertfordshire": "Bourne End is a village in Hertfordshire, England. It is situated on the ancient Roman Akeman Street between Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead, on the former A41 London-Liverpool Trunk Route, on the Grand Union Canal  that runs between London and Birmingham and at the confluence of the Chiltern chalk stream, the Bourne Gutter and the River Bulbourne. It is in the Dacorum Ward of Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield.\n Bourne End derives its name as it lies at the end of the Bourne Gutter, an irregularly flowing stream, at its confluence with the River Bulbourne. According to local tradition the Bourne Gutter is a Woe Water that only flows at times of tragedy. Recorded instances include during 1665 at the time of the Great Plague, in 1914 at the outbreak of the World War I and in 1956 during the Suez Crisis. The Hemel Hempstead Gazette has also run stories on the Gutter flowing in early 1982 as Argentinian Forces invaded the Falkland Islands, in early October 1987 days before the Great Storm of 1987 that devastated woodlands throughout southern England, and in 2003 as British troops joined the International invasion of Iraq \n Bourne End was the scene of the rail disaster on the West Coast Main Line on 30 September 1945 when an express train was derailed with many fatalities.\n According to English tradition Bourne End was classed as a hamlet and not a village as it did not have a parish church. It lay within the extended parish of Northchurch (Berkhamsted St. Mary). However, in Edwardian times, it became a village with the construction and consecration of the Parish Church of St. John The Evangelist when the Northchurch parish was divided.",

Recent research indicates that settlement along Westwick Row may well date back even further to the Iron Age and perhaps the Bronze Age.  It seems quite likely that this settlement was a \"suburb\" of  the major Iron Age settlement at Pre Wood just outside St. Albans.\n Leverstock Green was and is still affected by the 2005 Buncefield oil depot explosion (the largest explosion in peacetime Europe), causing damage to houses and other buildings, such as broken windows, fallen chimneys and in some cases more serious structural damage, temporarily displacing a number of families.\n The village is a growing village[citation needed], with a location close to an industrial estate from which many large companies operate.

  "/wiki/Berkhamsted": "Berkhamsted (/\u02c8b\u025c\u02d0rk\u0259mst\u025bd/ BUR-k\u0259m-sted) is a medium sized historic market town in Hertfordshire, England, in the Bulbourne valley, 26 miles (42\u00a0km) northwest of London. The town is a civil parish with a town council within the borough of Dacorum based in the neighbouring large new town of Hemel Hempstead. Berkhamsted and the adjoining village of Northchurch are surrounded by countryside, much of it in the Chiltern Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\n The High Street is on a pre-Roman route known by its Saxon name Akeman Street. The earliest written reference to Berkhamsted was in 970. The settlement was recorded as a burbium (ancient borough) in the Domesday Book in 1086. The most notable event in the town's history occurred in December 1066. After William the Conqueror defeated King Harold's Anglo-Saxon army at the Battle of Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon leadership surrendered to the Norman encampment at Berkhamsted. The event was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. From 1066 to 1495, Berkhamsted Castle was a favoured residence of royalty and notable historical figures, including Henry II, Edward, the Black Prince, Thomas Becket and Geoffrey Chaucer. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the town was a wool trading town, with a thriving local market. The oldest known extant jettied timber-framed building in Great Britain, built between 1277 and 1297, survives as a shop on the town's high street.\n After the castle was abandoned in 1495, the town went into decline, losing its borough status in the second half of the 17th century. Colonel Daniel Axtell, captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649, was among those born in Berkhamsted. Modern Berkhamsted began to expand after the canal and the railway were built in the 19th century. In the 21st century, Berkhamsted has evolved into an affluent commuter town.\n The town's literary connections include the 17th century hymnist and poet William Cowper, the 18th century writer Maria Edgeworth, and the 20th century novelist Graham Greene. Arts institutions in the town include The Rex, Berkhamsted (a well regarded independent cinema) and the British Film Institute's BFI National Archive at King's Hill  which is one of the largest film and television archives in the world. Schools in the town include Berkhamsted School a co-educational boarding independent school (founded in 1541 by John Incent, Dean of St Paul's Cathedral); Ashlyns School a state school, whose history began as the Foundling Hospital established in London by Thomas Coram in 1742; and Ashridge Executive Education, a business school offering degree level courses, which occupies the Grade I listed neo-Gothic Ashridge House.",

The Parish Council are keen to retain this status quo but are concerned that eventually the green belt will be lost by the growth of Hemel Hempstead where the gap is now down to little more than a mile from the boundary at Hempstead Lane.\n The geography of Potten End is such that most of the village is situated on a plateau of land extending from Ashridge to the north and rising from the valleys of the River Gade to the east and from the River Bulbourne to the west. The Green lies at a height of approximately 165.5\u00a0m (543\u00a0ft) above mean sea level.

The manor sits on the brow of the hill to the west of the main road that links Hughenden to High Wycombe.  The Earl, who died in 1881 was buried in a vault beneath the nearby Church of St Michael and All Angels, accessed from the churchyard.

The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as the property of the Grenville family; it was called Assedune.  The original name refers to the fact that in Saxon times this area was forested, serving as hunting land for the king.\n In recent times the manor of Ashendon passed into the hands of the Marquis of Buckingham.\n Included in with the parish of Ashendon are the hamlets of Upper Pollicott and Lower Pollicott.  The names of these hamlets derive from the Anglo Saxon Pol's Cottage.\n In the less distant past, Ashendon was an entirely farming village and, at present, there is still much agricultural activity within the village.  However, some of the farmhouses have been converted into private residences, the best example of this being Ashendon Farm and its barns.  Although Ashendon is a small village, in comparison with many nearby Buckinghamshire villages, it has a pub, a recreational playing field, a church and a thriving social club.\n One mile south-west of the village, near Lower Pollicott, on the Chiltern Main Line between Princes Risborough and Bicester North, is the site of the former Ashendon Junction, which was an elaborate flying junction engineered for a high-speed turnout on to the now-dismantled link to the now disused Great Central Main Line at Grendon Underwood Junction.

  "/wiki/Fairford_Leys": "Fairford Leys is an estate consisting of 1,900 homes, on the western edge of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England. It has its own centre, centred around a square, hosting a number of traditionally fronted shops, award-winning hair salon, supermarket, three restaurants, a nursery, an ecumenical church and a community centre. It also has a private health club with swimming pool which opened in October 2003.  The civil parish for Fairford Leys is Coldharbour which is an Aylesbury Vale district.  Its northern portion is home to a modern industrial area.\n The development is an example of an urban village, which is a town planning concept started in the UK in the late 1990s, with its roots in new urbanism and garden city ideals. The emphasis for this type of development is to focus on pedestrians over cars and other forms of community interaction. Fairford Leys is one of the first examples of a development planned using a Design Code, championed by John Prescott and the Labour government of the late 1990s. The aim of the code was to create an urban village development and it sets out design rules during, and also after, the construction phase, to ensure the individual developers all build to the same standard and to create cohesion to the design and appearance of the development as a whole. The driving force behind this was the original landowner, the Ernest Cook Trust. The architecture is inspired by traditional Aylesbury housing styles and pastiche Victorian lamp posts and railings. The centre of the estate is surrounded by the \"city wall\", a concept originating from the masterplanner John Simpson and inspired by medieval city walls, such as York. This consists of three- and four-storey townhouses and the main entrance to the centre is marked by two towers, loosely modelled on medieval gate towers.\n Developments in Fairford Leys are controlled by the 16-page guidelines, which are a summary of some of the important aspects of the original Design Code. They govern the look and materials used in several aspects of construction, including roof materials, chimneys, window materials, front boundary fences and planting, and front door colours.  \n The centre contains a higher density of housing, with larger detached properties at the edge of the estate. Originally the design included play areas, open spaces, playing fields and a golf course.[citation needed] The golf course has since been closed and fenced off due to the route of the impending HS2 crossing the area.",

The owner at that time was John Kersley Fowler who was the proposer of Benjamin Disraeli for Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire.\n The new housing estate was built in the 1970s and the major road through the estate was named after J. K. Fowler (above).  Since then the estate has seen a period of decline to the extent that it is now recognised as one of the most relatively deprived areas of the district.

Broughton is also the name of a nearby housing estate in Aylesbury itself.\n Early recordings of Broughton are:\n- the Domesday Book where it appears as \"22 households (quite large)\"\n- as being part of the manor of Bierton in the late 13th century. The hamlet name is Anglo-Saxon and means farm by a brook. The brook in this case is the Bearbrook that rises near Bedgrove, flows through Broughton then back into Aylesbury before joining the River Thame near Quarrendon.\n In the 1840s, a new branch railway was constructed linking Aylesbury to the Midlands that crossed the road that linked Broughton with Bierton. A public house and signalmen's cottages were constructed at the level crossing and the area became known as Broughton Crossing. Today, this is considered a separate hamlet from Broughton itself.\n In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson  described Bierton With Broughton like this:\nBIERTON-WITH-BROUGHTON, a parish in Aylesbury district, Bucks; on the Aylesbury railway, near the Aylesbury canal, 1\u00bd mile NE of Aylesbury. It has a post office, of the name of Bierton, under Aylesbury. Acres, 2,470. Real property, \u00a35,312. Pop., 691. Houses, 149. The property is divided among a few. The living is a vicarage, united with the vicarage of Quarrendon, in the diocese of Oxford. Value, \u00a3310.* Patrons, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln. The church is a structure of the 12th century, with tower and spire; was recently well repaired; and contains a piscina, and a curious monument of 1616 to Samuel Pope and his thirteen children. There are chapels for Baptists and Methodists, a national school, and charities \u00a340.\n In the 1960s British housing boom, land that belonged to the parish of Bierton was sold to developers who constructed the housing estate of Broughton.  Many local people immediately think of the estate when they hear the word 'Broughton,' as it is a very popular estate on which to live.  This was one of several developments in Aylesbury. All that separates Broughton hamlet from Broughton estate today is the brook from which the hamlet first took its name.\n Broughton is served by New Millside Pre-School for children aged from two to five, Broughton Infant School for children aged from four to seven, and Broughton Junior School for children aged from seven to eleven. Both schools are community schools, which each take approximately 180 pupils.\n In the same building as the pre-school, there is the Sure Start Children's Centre which serves the Broughton and immediately surrounding areas.\n There is an Anglican (Church of England) Church that meets at Circus Fields Canal Basin HP20 1AP) The church was established in 1989. Originally it was a daughter church of Holy Trinity, Walton. In August 2009 the Church Commissioners changed the parish boundaries in this part of Aylesbury and Broughton Church became a parish in its own right.\n In July 2014 a community coffee shop called more+ was opened in Parton Road. It is operated by Broughton Community Action which is a Registered Charity. The aim is to provide a place where residents can meet together and enhance community on the estate.\n Arriva the Shires & Essex 'Pink Route' 8 to Aylesbury bus station serves Broughton housing estate Monday-Saturday, at a frequency of up to every 20 minutes.
