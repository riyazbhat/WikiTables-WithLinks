  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides, especially roller coasters. Based in Clearfield, Utah, the company was the successor to Arrow Development (1946\u20131981) and Arrow Huss (1981\u20131986), which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters. The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, built in 1959, was Arrow's first roller coaster project. In 1975, Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew, at Knott's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews. Arrow created several other firsts over the years, introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century, The Bat, in 1981, and the world's first hypercoaster, Magnum XL-200, which opened in 1989. They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster, X2, which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002. Arrow Development's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s.",

  "/wiki/Accelerator_Coaster": "An Accelerator Coaster is a hydraulically launched roller coaster model from Intamin. The model usually consists of a long, straight launch track, a top hat tower element, and magnetic brakes that smoothly stop the train without making contact. The technology was developed by Intamin engineers as an alternative to electromagnetic launch systems, such as the Linear Induction Motor (LIM) and Linear Synchronous Motor (LSM), that are found on earlier launched roller coasters like the Flight of Fear and The Joker's Jinx. Unlike the earlier linear induction motors, the Accelerator Coaster's launch system exhibits constant acceleration and is capable of reaching greater speeds. Accelerator Coasters with the top hat element are known to perform an occasional rollback \u2013 when the train is unable to complete the top hat element and rolls back to the starting point \u2013 which can occur due to a number of different factors. Despite this, Accelerator Coasters have a great track record for safety and are extremely power efficient, especially compared to older technologies such as the classic chain lift found on most roller coasters.

  "/wiki/Dive_Coaster": "The Dive Coaster is a steel roller coaster model developed and engineered by Bolliger & Mabillard. The design features one or more near-vertical drops that are approximately 90 degrees, which provide a moment of free-falling for passengers. The experience is enhanced by unique trains that seat up to ten riders per row, spanning only two or three rows total. Unlike traditional train design, this distinguishing aspect gives all passengers virtually the same experience throughout the course of the ride. Another defining characteristic of Dive Coasters is the holding brake at the top of the lift hill that stops the train momentarily right as it enters the first drop, suspending some passengers with a view looking straight down and releasing suddenly moments later. Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers opening on March 14, 1998, making it the world's first Dive Coaster.
