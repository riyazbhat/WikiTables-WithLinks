  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d (h\u014dgaku), meaning literally (home) country music (as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d (y\u014dgaku) - Western music) is the folk or traditional music of Japan. Japan's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music, such as Gagaku (court music) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d (Buddhist chanting), but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku, in a broad sense, as the form from which the others were derived. Outside of ethnomusicology, however, H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century. Within this framework, there are three types of traditional music in Japan: theatrical, court music (called gagaku), and instrumental.",

  "/wiki/Koto_(musical_instrument)": "The koto (\u7b8f) is a Japanese stringed musical instrument derived from the Chinese zheng, and similar to the Mongolian yatga, the Korean gayageum, the Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n tranh, and the Sundanese kacapi. The koto is the national instrument of Japan. Koto are about 180 centimetres (71\u00a0in) length, and made from kiri wood (Paulownia tomentosa). They have 13 strings that are usually strung over 13 movable bridges along the width of the instrument.  There is also a 17-string variant.  Players can adjust the string pitches by moving the white bridges before playing.  To play the instrument, the strings are plucked using three finger picks (thumb, index finger, and middle finger).",
