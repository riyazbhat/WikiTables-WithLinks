The Illusion records were also supported by the extensive Use Your Illusion Tour, a world tour that lasted from 1991-1993. The Spaghetti Incident? (1993), an album of covers, was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.

On the advice of the managing director of their record label, the two came together to record Neverending Love, which became a hit single in Sweden. After the release of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a greatest hits record, the duo took a hiatus before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day (1999) and Room Service (2001).
