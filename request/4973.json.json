  "/wiki/Chess": "Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64\u00a0squares arranged in an 8\u00d78 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7th\u00a0century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), and shogi (Japanese chess). Chess reached Europe by the 9th\u00a0century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th\u00a0century; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th\u00a0century.",
  "/wiki/Fast_chess": "Fast chess (also known as speed chess) is a type of chess in which each player is given less time to consider their moves than normal tournament time controls allow. The rules specify a cumulative total time for moves for each side. In a fast chess game, each player will have less than the usual 60 minutes at their disposal, based on a 60-move game, and sometimes considerably less time. Fast chess is further subdivided, by decreasing time controls, into rapid chess, blitz chess, and bullet chess. Armageddon chess is a particular variation in which different rules apply for each of the two players.",
