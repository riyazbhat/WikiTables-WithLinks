Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character.

Cartoons on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons.\n He introduced and/or developed several of the studio's biggest stars, including Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Tweety, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam (to whom he was said to bear more than a passing resemblance), and Speedy Gonzales. The senior director at Warners' Termite Terrace studio, Freleng directed more cartoons than any other director in the studio (a total of 266), and is also the most honored of the Warner directors, having won five Academy Awards and three Emmy Awards[disputed  \u2013 discuss]. After Warners closed down the animation studio in 1963, Freleng and business partner David H. DePatie founded DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises, which produced cartoons (including The Pink Panther Show), feature film title sequences, and Saturday-morning cartoons through the early 1980s.\n The nickname \"Friz\" came from his friend, Hugh Harman, who initially nicknamed him \"Congressman Frizby\" after a fictional senator who appeared in satirical pieces in the Los Angeles Examiner.

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character. Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles.\n He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, \"Th-th-th-that's all folks!\" This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. In contrast, the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan: So Long, Folks! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series (when Bugs Bunny was the closing character, he would break the pattern by simply saying, in his Brooklynese accent, \"And Dat's De End!\"). He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character.\n Porky's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, \"What's going on?\" might become \"What's guh-guh-guh-guh\u2014...what's happening?\" Porky's age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in Porky's Preview), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years. In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons, Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head, and his attempt to close the show with \"The End\" becomes \"Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks!\" Porky Pig would appear in 153 cartoons in the Golden age of American animation.",

Clampett was born and raised not far from Hollywood, and early on expressed an interest in animation and puppetry. After leaving high school a few months shy of graduating in 1931, Clampett joined the team at Harman-Ising Productions and began working on the studio's newest short subjects, titled Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.\n Clampett was promoted to a directorial position in 1937 and during his fifteen years at the studio, directed 84 cartoons later deemed classic and designed some of the studio's most famous characters, including Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and Tweety. Among Clampett's most acclaimed films are Porky in Wackyland (1938) and The Great Piggy Bank Robbery (1946). Clampett left Warner Bros. Cartoons in 1946 and turned his attention to television, creating the puppet show Time for Beany in 1949. A later animated version of the series, titled Beany and Cecil, was initially broadcast on ABC in 1962 and was rerun until 1967. The series is considered the first fully creator-driven television series, and carried the byline \"a Bob Clampett Cartoon\".\n In his later years, Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation. His Warner cartoons have seen renewed praise in decades since for their surrealistic qualities, energetic and outrageous animation, and irreverent humor. Animation historian Jerry Beck lauded Clampett for \"putting the word 'looney' in Looney Tunes.\"",

The mascots on the labels of the food products come to life and perform various song and dance numbers.\n First, a cow for \"Contented Milk\" sings to a \"Fulla Bull Tobacco\" bull \"If I Could Be with You,\" while two other cows on cans reading \"Discontented Milk\" ogle and whistle at the bull. Meanwhile, a crab imitating Ned Sparks states \"This love stuff makes me sick!\", after which a rabbit named Jack Bunny (a parody of Jack Benny and also a same name from I Love to Singa) tells the music maestro (a dish mop caricaturing Leopold Stokowski) to start up, and a label for \"Big Top Popcorn\" comes to life while a dog barker for \"Barker's Dog Food\" addresses the crowd and introduces each of the circus's attractions including \"Little Egypt Wiggly Gum,\" \"Billy Posie's Aquackade\" swimmers (a parody of Footlight Parade's \"By a Waterfall\"), and the \"Tomato Can Can Dancers\". Meanwhile, an \"Animal Crackers\" gorilla (intended to parody King Kong) hears the noise and starts growling, at one point stating to the audience, \"Gosh, ain't I repulsive?\" This gorilla stares at the female performers and smiles, he then begins his attack attempting to abduct one of the \"Can Can Dancers\"; Jack Bunny sees this and rides a bottle of \"Horse Radish\" while an army of \"Navy Beans\" and \"Turtle Soup Turtles\" shoots at the gorilla, who defends himself with a Roman candle while at one point destroying the bottle of Horse Radish that Jack is riding. Jack sees a box of \"Chocolate-Covered A1 Cherries\" and snatches the axe on the label amid cheering from an army of chicks, at which point the gorilla shoots the axe with the candle causing it to shrink. As Jack Bunny dons a sheepish grin and backs into a corner, the image of Superman on a box of \"Superguy Soap Chips\" comes to life at the sight of the gorilla lighting a stick of dynamite with Bunny's cigar. Superman flies up to the gorilla and shouts at him, \"Hey, you big ape!\" and the gorilla replies \"Yeah?\" which scares Superman so much that he turns into a helpless, whining baby. Then, as the gorilla is about to destroy Jack Bunny with the dynamite in his hand, a voice calls out \"Henry!\" (in reference to the opening of The Aldrich Family), causing him to pause and run towards the direction of the voice, saying in a frightened voice \"Coming mother!\" (another reference to the opening) while his apparent \"mother\" drags him away by his ear, chastising him for his naughty behaviors. Jack Bunny breathes a sigh of relief only to realize he's still holding the dynamite, which explodes leaving him in blackface. After being exploded on, he then concludes the cartoon with an Eddie Rochester impression: \"My oh my, tattletale grey!\"",

He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catch phrase \"Eh...What's up, doc?\". Due to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment, but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world.

Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\", as well as his trademark laughter.\n The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones' work What's Opera, Doc? (one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs, though he felt bad about it), the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville, and the \"Hunting Trilogy\" of \"Rabbit Season/Duck Season\" shorts (Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, and Duck!

  "/wiki/The_Honeymooners": "The Honeymooners is a classic American television sitcom created by and starring Jackie Gleason, based on a recurring comedy sketch of the same name that had been part of his variety show. It followed the day to day life of New York City bus driver Ralph Kramden (Gleason), his wife Alice (Audrey Meadows), and his best friend Ed Norton (Art Carney) as they get involved with various scenarios in their day to day living. Most episodes revolved around Ralph's poor choices in absurd dilemmas which frequently showed his quick-to-judge attitude in a comedic tone, but also revolved around more serious issues such as women's rights and social impressions.\n The sketches originally aired on the DuMont network's variety series Cavalcade of Stars, which Gleason hosted, and subsequently on the CBS network's The Jackie Gleason Show, which was broadcast live in front of a theater audience. The popularity of the sketches led Gleason to rework The Honeymooners  as a filmed half-hour series, which debuted October 1, 1955, on CBS, in place of the variety series. It was initially a ratings success as the No. 2 show in the United States during its first season, facing stiff competition from The Perry Como Show on NBC. The show eventually dropped to No. 19, ending its production after 39 episodes (now referred to as the \"Classic 39 episodes\"). The final episode of The Honeymooners aired on September 22, 1956, although Gleason sporadically revived the characters until 1978.\n The Honeymooners was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working-class married couples in a gritty, non-idyllic manner, as the show is mostly set in the Kramdens' kitchen in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building.",
