  "/wiki/Auckland_Region": "The Auckland Region (M\u0101ori: T\u0101maki Makaurau) is one of the sixteen regions of New Zealand, named for the city of Auckland, the country's largest urban area. The region encompasses the Auckland metropolitan area, smaller towns, rural areas, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf. Containing 33 percent of the nation's residents, it has by far the largest population and economy of any region of New Zealand, but the second-smallest land area.\n On 1 November 2010, the Auckland Region became a unitary authority administered by the Auckland Council, replacing the previous regional council and seven local councils. In the process, an area in its southeastern corner was transferred to the neighbouring Waikato Region.",
  "/wiki/Hunua_Ranges": "The Hunua Ranges form a block of hilly country to the southeast of Auckland in New Zealand's North Island. They cover some 250 square kilometres (97 sq mi), containing 178 km\u00b2 of parkland, and rise to 688 metres (2255 ft) at Kohukohunui. Auckland gets much of its water from reservoirs within the Hunua Ranges. The ranges contain many rivers and streams, including the Hunua Falls on the Wairoa River, which is a popular tourist and local spot in the Ranges. The ranges are located approximately 50 kilometres (30 mi) southeast of Auckland, above the western shore of the Firth of Thames. They are sparsely populated, and mostly lie within the boundaries of the Waharau and Hunua Ranges Regional Parks. The settlement of Hunua lies on the foot of the Hunua Ranges. Maori made some use of the ranges and early European visitors found areas of clearing that had been used as gardens.",

  "/wiki/Te_Korowai-o-Te-Tonga_Peninsula": "Te Korowai-o-Te-Tonga Peninsula, also known by its former name of the South Kaipara Peninsula, is a long peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand, extending north along the western edge of the Kaipara Harbour for some 35 kilometres (22 mi) from near Helensville to the harbour's mouth. The peninsula was officially renamed in 2013 as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement. The name, which is M\u0101ori for The cloak of the south, reflects the peninsula's geographical role in guarding the southern half of the Kaipara Harbour from the Tasman Sea and prevailing westerly winds. The mouth of the Kaipara Harbour separates the peninsula from the larger Pouto Peninsula to the north. The Peninsula is mostly low-lying or gently undulating, rising to only some 191 metres (627 ft) at its highest point. It is bounded in the west by the Tasman Sea, with the long beaches of Te Oneone Rangatira Beach and Muriwai Beach along its Tasman coast. The settlement of Muriwai lies immediately to the south of the peninsula. Inland from the Tasman Sea coast is the long strip of Woodhill Forest, which is bounded in the east by a string of low-lying lakes, of which the largest and northernmost is Lake Rototoa.",
  "/wiki/Lake_Kawaupaku": "Lake Kawaupaku (sometimes spelled Kawaupaka) is a small lake near Te Henga (Bethells Beach) in the Auckland Region of New Zealand. The lake is on private land, and is one of the few dune lakes in the region to be surrounded by native forest.",
  "/wiki/Dune": "Dunes are large masses of wind-blown sand, and are most common in deserted environments, such as the Sahara, and also near beaches. An area with dunes is called a dune system. In physical geography, a dune is a hill of loose sand built by aeolian processes (wind) or the flow of water. Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, formed by interaction with the flow of air or water. Dunes can be natural, but also man-made (artificial). Most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter slip face in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a slack. An erg or sand sea is a large broad, flat area covered with wind-swept sand and/or dunes with little or no vegetation.",
  "/wiki/Bethells_Beach": "Te Henga (Bethells Beach) is a coastal community of the Auckland Region in the north of the North Island, New Zealand. The M\u0101ori name for the area Te Henga is in reference to the long foredunes which run along the beach and look like the Henga or Gunwhale of an upturned waka hull . This name originally applied to a wide area of the lower Waitakere River valley, but during the early 1900s the area became popular with visiting European immigrants who began to refer to the area as Bethells Beach after the Bethells Family who live there and still own much of the area. In 1976 the New Zealand Geographic Board officially named the area Te Henga (Bethells Beach). The beach is approximately 37 kilometres west of Auckland City, at the mouth of the Waitakere River where it flows into the Tasman Sea. One of several popular resorts in the area (others include Muriwai, Piha and Karekare), it is rated  the 4th most dangerous beach in New Zealand to swim at due to its strong rips and currents. There have been many fatalaties including in 2009, Rugby League star Sonny Fai who was never located. It experiences a population explosion over summer with thousands of visitors.",

It is primarily filled by underground water, and losses are due to evaporation from the surface of the lake.",

At the northern tip, the Manukau Heads rises to a 285-metre (935 ft) prominence above the entrance to the similarly-named harbour. The nearby historic Manukau Heads Lighthouse is one of the few in the country open to the public.\n The peninsula is relatively sparsely populated, despite its proximity to the centre of Auckland city (which lies 30 kilometres (19 mi) to the northeast). The largest settlement on or near the peninsula is Waiuku, which lies at the peninsula's isthmus.",
  "/wiki/Lake_Pupuke": "Lake Pupuke is a heart-shaped freshwater lake occupying a volcanic crater (or maar) between the suburbs of Takapuna and Milford on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand. The heart shape is a result of its formation by the linking of two circular craters - a larger one forming most of the lake and a smaller one forming the arm in the northeast. Separated from the sea by less than 200 m at one point, it has a circumference of about 4.5 km and reaches 57 m in depth. It is popular for recreational activities and the lakefront property around it.",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_crater_lake": "A volcanic crater lake is a lake in a crater that was formed from explosive activity or collapse during a volcanic eruption. Lakes in calderas fill large craters formed by the collapse of a volcano during an eruption. Lakes in maars fill medium-sized craters where an eruption deposited debris around a vent. Crater lakes form as the created depression, within the crater rim, is filled by water. The water may come from precipitation, groundwater circulation (often hydrothermal fluids in the case of volcanic craters) or melted ice. Its level rises until an equilibrium is reached between the rates of incoming and outgoing water. Sources of water loss singly or together may include evaporation, subsurface seepage, and, in places, surface leakage or overflow when the lake level reaches the lowest point on its rim. At such a saddle location, the upper portion of the lake is contained only by its adjacent natural volcanic dam; continued leakage through or surface outflow across the dam can erode its included material, thus lowering lake level until a new equilibrium of water flow, erosion, and rock resistance is established.",
