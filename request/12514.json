  "/wiki/Biomass": "Biomass is plant or animal material used for energy production (electricity or heat), or in various industrial processes as raw substance for a range of products. It can be purposely grown energy crops (e.g. miscanthus, switchgrass), wood or forest residues, waste from food crops (wheat straw, bagasse), horticulture (yard waste), food processing (corn cobs), animal farming (manure, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus), or human waste from sewage plants.",
  "/wiki/Peat": "Peat (/pi\u02d0t/), also known as turf (/t\u025c\u02d0rf/), is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter. It is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs. The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet, because peatland plants capture CO2 naturally released from the peat, maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the \"annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition\", but it takes \"thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of 1.5 to 2.3\u00a0m\u00a0[4.9 to 7.5\u00a0ft], which is the average depth of the boreal [northern] peatlands\". Sphagnum moss, also called peat moss, is one of the most common components in peat, although many other plants can contribute. The biological features of Sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation, a phenomenon termed 'habitat manipulation'. Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing the rate of decomposition.",

Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves.

Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.",
