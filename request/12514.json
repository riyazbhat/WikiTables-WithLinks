  "/wiki/Alholmens_Kraft_Power_Station": "The Alholmens Kraft Power Station (also known as Jakobstad Power Station or Pietarsaari Power Station) is a biomass power station in Alholmen, Jakobstad in Ostrobothnia region, Finland.  It is the largest biomass cogeneration power station in the world.\n The power station was commissioned in 2001. It was built next to the existing, now decommissioned power station. The power station is located slightly north of UPM-Kymmene Wisaforest pulp and paper mill in Alholmen.  The decommissioned power station had two black liquor recovery boilers, one oil fired package boiler, one bark boiler as well as several steam turbines with the electrical output of 75\u00a0MW.\n The new power station was designed by Metso and its boiler was manufactured by Kv\u00e6rner.  It employs 400\u00a0people. The power station has an installed capacity of 265\u00a0MW of electrical power.  In addition, it provides 60\u00a0MW district heating for the city of Jakobstad and 100\u00a0MW process steam and heat for the UPM-Kymmene paper mill.\n The new power station uses wood-based biofuels (forest residues) as the main fuel.  Peat is also used while coal is a reserve fuel.  It burns about 300,000\u00a0bales of forest residues per year.  The power station is equipped with the circulating fluidized bed boiler with capacity of 500\u00a0MWth, which is the largest biomass-fired CFB boiler in the world.

  "/wiki/Biomass": "Biomass is plant or animal material used for energy production (electricity or heat), or in various industrial processes as raw substance for a range of products. It can be purposely grown energy crops (e.g. miscanthus, switchgrass), wood or forest residues, waste from food crops (wheat straw, bagasse), horticulture (yard waste), food processing (corn cobs), animal farming (manure, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus), or human waste from sewage plants.\n Burning plant-derived biomass releases CO2, but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the CO2 back into new crops. In some cases, this recycling of CO2 from plants to atmosphere and back into plants can even be CO2 negative, as a relatively large portion of the CO2 is moved to the soil during each cycle.\n Cofiring with biomass has increased in coal power plants, because it makes it possible to release less CO2 without the cost associated with building new infrastructure. Co-firing is not without issues however, often an upgrade of the biomass is beneficiary. Upgrading to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods, broadly classified as thermal, chemical, or biochemical (see below).",
  "/wiki/Peat": "Peat (/pi\u02d0t/), also known as turf (/t\u025c\u02d0rf/), is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter. It is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs. The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet, because peatland plants capture CO2 naturally released from the peat, maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the \"annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition\", but it takes \"thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of 1.5 to 2.3\u00a0m\u00a0[4.9 to 7.5\u00a0ft], which is the average depth of the boreal [northern] peatlands\". Sphagnum moss, also called peat moss, is one of the most common components in peat, although many other plants can contribute. The biological features of Sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation, a phenomenon termed 'habitat manipulation'. Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing the rate of decomposition.\n Peatlands, particularly bogs, are the primary source of peat,\nalthough less-common wetlands including fens, pocosins, and peat swamp forests also deposit peat. Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including Sphagnum moss, ericaceous shrubs, and sedges (see bog for more information on this aspect of peat). Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years, peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains, such as pollen. This allows the reconstruction of past environments and study changes in land use.\n Peat is harvested as an important[citation needed] source of fuel in certain parts of the world. By volume, there are about 4\u00a0trillion cubic metres (5.2\u00a0trillion cubic yards) of peat in the world, covering a total of around 2% of the global land area (about 3\u00a0million square kilometres or 1.2\u00a0million square miles), containing about 8\u00a0billion terajoules of energy. Over time, the formation of peat is often the first step in the geological formation of fossil fuels such as coal, particularly low-grade coal such as lignite.\n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) classifies peat as neither a fossil fuel nor a renewable fuel, and notes that its emission characteristics are similar to fossil fuels.  At 106\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/MJ, the carbon dioxide emission intensity of peat is higher than that of coal (at 94.6\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/MJ) and natural gas (at 56.1) (IPCC). Peat is not a renewable source of energy, due to its extraction rate in industrialized countries far exceeding its slow regrowth rate of 1\u00a0mm per year, and as it is also reported that peat regrowth takes place only in 30\u201340% of peatlands. Because of this, the UNFCCC,[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and another organization affiliated with the United Nations classified peat as a fossil fuel.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Many in the peat industry describe it as a \"slowly renewable\" fuel.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]",

  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.\nCoal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands\u2014called coal forests\u2014that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.\n As a fossil fuel burned for heat, coal supplies about a quarter of the world's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity. Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal.\n The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness. The coal industry damages the environment, including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide, 14 gigatonne (Gt) in 2016, which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal, and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020. To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2\u00a0\u00b0C (3.6\u00a0\u00b0F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030.\n The largest consumer and importer of coal is China. China mines almost half the world's coal, followed by India with about a tenth. Australia accounts for about a third of world coal exports followed by Indonesia and Russia.",
  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas (also called fossil gas) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.\n Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals.\n Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change; it itself is a greenhouse gas, and it releases carbon dioxide when burned. However, natural gas use often supplants coal use, which is far more environmentally damaging, leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States.\n Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates. Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.\n In petroleum production, gas is sometimes burned as flare gas. Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, most, but not all, must be processed to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of this processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen.\n Natural gas is sometimes informally referred to simply as \"gas\", especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal. However, it is not to be confused with gasoline, especially in North America, where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas.",
