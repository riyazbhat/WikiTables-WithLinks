During the 18th century Richmond Bridge was completed and many Georgian terraces were built, particularly around Richmond Green and on Richmond Hill. These remain well preserved and many have listed building architectural or heritage status. The opening of the railway station in 1846 was a significant event in the absorption of the town into a rapidly expanding London. Richmond was formerly part of the ancient parish of Kingston upon Thames in the county of Surrey. In 1890 the town became a municipal borough, which was later extended to include Kew, Ham, Petersham and part of Mortlake (North Sheen).

This renowned hill offers the only view in England to be protected by an Act of Parliament - the Richmond, Ham and Petersham Open Spaces Act passed in 1902 - to protect the land on and below Richmond Hill and thus preserve the fine foreground views to the west and south. Immortalised in paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds and J. M. W. Turner, it was described by Sir Walter Scott as an unrivalled landscape. It was this view that inspired the name of Richmond, Virginia, after colonial city founder William Byrd II noticed a curve in the James River that remarkably resembled this meander of Thames.

  "/wiki/Ashford,_Surrey": "Ashford is a town and suburb of London almost entirely in the Surrey County Council borough of Spelthorne, but with one side road (Challenge Road) in the London Borough of Hounslow, England. The Clumps is in Feltham. [n 1] Mostly residential, Ashford is 13 1\u20442 miles (22 km) WSW of Charing Cross, London, forms part of the London commuter belt, with a minor stop on the Waterloo to Reading Line (which has two branch lines) and has a long commercial high street. It is centred 2 1\u20442 miles (4 km) south of Heathrow Airport, to which a portion of its economy relates, including business premises relating to aviation and the distribution of air freight - the main cargo depot being next to an adjoining village, Stanwell. Historically part of Middlesex, the town's wards have been part of the administrative area of Surrey County Council since Middlesex County Council was abolished in 1965. South Western Railway uses the present or past county variously throughout its stations and trains. A leading gymnastics club, HMP Bronzefield and one of the sites of Brooklands College are in the town. Ashford Hospital is narrowly within Stanwell and began as Ashford's workhouse. Ashford Common has a parade of shops and is a more residential ward that includes part of the Queen Mary Reservoir and all of its related water treatment works, which is contiguous with and subsidiary to the town itself. Ashford consists of relatively low density low and medium rise buildings, none of them being high rise. If excluding apartments (at the last census 27% of the housing stock) most houses are semi-detached. Ashford is defined along its northern edge by a dual carriageway and extends no more than 1\u20444 mile (400 m) beyond another parallel to the southern boundary.",
  "/wiki/Sunbury-on-Thames": "Sunbury-on-Thames is a suburb of London in the borough of Spelthorne, in the historic County of Middlesex and administrative county of Surrey in England. It extends from the left bank of the River Thames and the south-west of the Greater London boundary and is approximately 13 miles (21 km) from Charing Cross, London. Suburban neighbourhoods make up most of its area, Lower Sunbury, added to which is part of the Metropolitan Green Belt including Kempton Park. The town centre is by the London end of the M3 motorway; elsewhere are three shopping parades and riverside public houses. In tourism, Lower Sunbury holds an annual fair and regatta each August. Sunbury railway station is on a branch line from London Waterloo. Lower Sunbury contains most of the town's parks, pubs and listed buildings, Kempton Park Racecourse, served by its own railway station, and a public walled garden which has a large millennium tapestry in its art gallery/caf\u00e9. Offices and hotels form part of its labour-importing economy. Most of Sunbury's riverside forms privately owned houses or lodges with gardens, including Wheatley's Ait and Sunbury Court Island which are attached by footbridges. Many schools are based in the town including large secondary schools in the Catholic and Anglican traditions; some maintain sixth form colleges. Sunbury adjoins Feltham to the north, Hampton to the east, Ashford to the northwest, Shepperton to the southwest and Walton-on-Thames to the south, on the opposite bank of the Thames.",

Shepperton is equidistant between the towns of Chertsey and Sunbury-on-Thames. Shepperton is mentioned in a document of 959 AD and in the Domesday Book, where it was an agricultural village. In the early 19th century resident writers and poets included Rider Haggard, Thomas Love Peacock, George Meredith and Percy Bysshe Shelley, attracted by the Thames beside which they and other wealthy residents lived. The river was painted at Walton Bridge here in 1754 by Canaletto and in 1805 by Turner. Its accessibility was improved by Sunbury Lock and Shepperton Lock built in the 1810s, supporting the trade and agricultural barges and later the use of residential narrowboats. Historically located within the county of Middlesex, due to its location north of the River Thames, the suburbanisation of Shepperton began late, in the latter part of the 19th century, with the construction in 1864 of its railway - the owner of its manor, William Schaw Lindsay sponsored the venture which had aims to be extended via Chertsey and connect to the South Western Main Line. Shepperton's proximity to burgeoning London led to small businesses being established along its high street by the end of the century. With its film studios and production facilities and electrified railway since the 1930s many more homes have been constructed; its population rose from 1,810 residents in the early 20th century to a little short of 10,000 in 2011.

  "/wiki/Littleton,_Spelthorne": "Littleton is a village in the borough of Spelthorne, Surrey, England. Its amenities are a Church of England parish church, village green and Shepperton Studios. [n 1] It covers the narrow east-west strip of land between all parts of Shepperton Green to the south and the Queen Mary Reservoir to its north, having contributed most of the land to the reservoir in 1931 and having historically reached to the River Thames at Chertsey Bridge. Contiguous with Shepperton Green which has a parade of shops, the divide is the River Ash, a stream. It borders Laleham to the west and Charlton which is also in the post town of Shepperton, centred 0.5 miles (800 m) to the north-east and which has one of the nearest pubs. London Heathrow Airport is centred 5 miles (8 km) north. The River Thames is about 2.5 miles (4 km) south. Sunbury Golf Course is beyond the M3 motorway in land of Charlton manor which as the name denotes, lay within Sunbury. That land and Upper Halliford, beyond, is however since the early 20th century also within Shepperton's postal boundaries. The nearest station is Shepperton railway station. For centuries Littleton covered about 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2) until the construction of the reservoir and ecclesiastical expansion of Shepperton - either way it covers no more than a fifth of its former land. The decision to name Shepperton Studios by that name rather than Littleton and the fact of Shepperton railway station being a terminus of a commuter line and being a borderline town (with Christmas and summer fairs, a high street, but no street market) make some people omit the word 'Littleton' from their address altogether.",

To the west of the village proper stretch further areas of open land, much of which is part of the Metropolitan Green Belt and is important primarily for fish and bird life, including the Staines Moor SSSI and the Colne Valley regional park. Stanwell lost land to a fraction of the adjoining airport and to Berkshire in the mid- and late 20th century respectively. Its main industrial and business area, Poyle, was detached and added to Colnbrook, Berkshire, in 1995 due to the completion of the M25 London Orbital Motorway.
