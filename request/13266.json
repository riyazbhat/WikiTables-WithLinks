  "/wiki/Compression_(phonetics)": "In phonology, syncope (/\u02c8s\u026a\u014bk\u0259pi/; from Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae, romanized:\u00a0sunkop\u1e17, lit.\u00a0'cutting up') is the loss of one or more sounds from the interior of a word, especially the loss of an unstressed vowel. It is found both in synchronic analysis of languages and diachronics. Its opposite, whereby sounds are added, is epenthesis.",

It was established by Dmitri Borgmann in 1968 at the behest of Martin Gardner. Howard Bergerson took over as editor-in-chief for 1969, but stepped down when Greenwood Periodicals dropped the publication. A.

  "/wiki/French_language": "French (le fran\u00e7ais [l\u0259 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b] or la langue fran\u00e7aise [la l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl\u2014languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) has largely supplanted. French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.",
  "/wiki/Smurf": "The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, human-like creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. The Smurfs was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, wherein they were known as Les Schtroumpfs. There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as \"Jokey Smurf\", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. \"Smurfette\" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.",

He is widely known for his 1980 novel Il nome della rosa (The Name of the Rose), a historical mystery combining semiotics in fiction with biblical analysis, medieval studies, and literary theory.

  "/wiki/General_American": "General American English or General American (abbreviated GA or GenAm) is the umbrella accent of American English spoken by a majority of Americans and widely perceived, among Americans, as lacking any distinctly regional, ethnic, or socioeconomic characteristics. In reality, it encompasses a continuum of accents rather than a single unified accent. Americans with high education, or from the North Midland, Western New England, and Western regions of the country, are the most likely to be perceived as having \"General American\" accents. The precise definition and usefulness of the term \"General American\" continue to be debated, and the scholars who use it today admittedly do so as a convenient basis for comparison rather than for exactness. Other scholars prefer the term Standard American English.",
  "/wiki/Received_Pronunciation": "Received Pronunciation (RP), commonly called BBC English and Standard British pronunciation or Southern British pronunciation, is an accent of Standard English in the United Kingdom and is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as \"the standard accent of English as spoken in the south of England\", although it can be heard from native speakers throughout England and Wales. Peter Trudgill estimated in 1974 that 3 per cent of people in Britain were RP speakers, but this rough estimate has been questioned by the phonetician J. Windsor Lewis.  Clive Upton notes higher estimates of 5% (Romaine, 2000) and 10% (Wells, 1982) but refers to all these as \"guesstimates\" that are not based on robust research.",
  "/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences": "Many of the differences between American and British English date back to a time when spelling standards had not yet developed. For instance, some spellings seen as \"American\" today were once commonly used in Britain and some spellings seen as \"British\" were once commonly used in the United States. A \"British standard\" began to emerge following the 1755 publication of Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language, and an \"American standard\" started following the work of Noah Webster and in particular his An American Dictionary of the English Language, first published in 1828.",
  "/wiki/Brougham_(carriage)": "A brougham (pronounced \"broom\" or \"brohm\") was a light, four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage built in the 19th century.[note 1]  It was named after the politician and jurist Lord Brougham, who had this type of carriage built to his specification by London coachbuilder Robinson & Cook in 1838 or 1839.  It had an enclosed body with two doors, like the rear section of a coach; it sat two, sometimes with an extra pair of fold-away seats in the front corners, and with a box seat in front for the driver and a footman or passenger. Unlike a coach, the carriage had a glazed front window, so that the occupants could see forward. The forewheels were capable of turning sharply. A variant, called a brougham-landaulet, had a top collapsible from the rear doors backward.[note 2]",

  "/wiki/Zoom_Schwartz_Profigliano": "Zoom Schwartz Profigliano, also known as figliano, is a verbal \"tag\" drinking game with many variations.  One player at a time is active (\"it\").  The active player states a command from a predefined set of words, which typically include \"zoom,\" \"schwartz,\" and \"profigliano.\"  The command shifts active status to another player, 'tagging' them.  Play continues until a player fouls by giving a command when not active, by failing to give a command promptly when active, or in some cases by giving a command which is prohibited by the current state of the game.  The game lends itself to bluffing where the active player uses nonverbal communication to suggest that someone else is active.  In a high-speed game a player might give a command passing active status to one player while looking at a different player, confusing the situation.",
