  "/wiki/Magenta": "Magenta (/m\u0259\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnt\u0259/) is a color that is variously defined as purplish-red, reddish-purple or mauvish-crimson. On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, it is located midway between red and blue. It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by an inkjet printer, along with yellow, black, and cyan, to make all the other colors. The tone of magenta used in printing is called \"printer's magenta\". Magenta is technically not a color, it has no wave length of its own although it is classified as a color by many and it is easier to call it one. Magenta took its name from an aniline dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist Fran\u00e7ois-Emmanuel Verguin, who originally called it fuchsine. It was renamed to celebrate the Italian-French victory at the Battle of Magenta fought between the French and Austrians on June 4, 1859, near the Italian town of Magenta in Lombardy. A virtually identical color, called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists: Chambers Nicolson and George Maule.",
