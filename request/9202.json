  "/wiki/List_of_Pi_Kappa_Phi_chapters": "The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity has founded a total of 232 chapters in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. As of May 3, 2013, there are 178 active chapters (162 chartered, plus 16 associate chapters, or colonies), and 93 alumni organizations. Soon after its inception at The College of Charleston in 1904 (the Alpha chapter), the fraternity began spreading to other campuses, granting charters to student groups at Presbyterian College (Beta, 1907), Berkeley (Gamma, 1909), and Furman University (Delta, 1909). Gamma (Berkeley) was the first long-distance chapter, which helped to firmly establish Pi Kappa Phi as a national fraternity. In some instances during those early days, the creation of a chapter was by necessity a clandestine affair, as was the case with the Delta Chapter at Furman University. At the time, South Carolina had a state law that banned fraternities at state-supported schools, so as a result, Presbyterian College and the College of Charleston were the only two South Carolina schools in which fraternities were allowed. The Furman chapter therefore operated sub rosa (under the rose), until state laws were later changed so as to allow fraternal organizations. The next two decades saw the addition of 36 new chapters in the Midwest, South, and West Coast regions."
