  "/wiki/Camp_Monteith": "Camp Monteith was a military base in Gjilan, Kosovo[a], about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) east of Camp Bondsteel. A former Serb artillery outpost and 79 parcels of private land, the area was taken over by U.S. Marines and used as a base of operation during the Kosovo War of 1999. The camp was named after Jimmie W. Monteith, who received the Medal of Honor for heroism in France during World War II. At its peak, the camp housed 2000 soldiers and civilian contractors.  Established in June 1999 to be used as a staging point for the bulk of US forces stationed in the Multi National Brigade-East.  Initially occupied by U.S. Marines, over the past seven years successive rotations of U.S. Army forces have used the camp as part of NATO\u2019s KFOR.\n The base camp originally consisted of one main building, used as a command post and makeshift interrogation center, as well as a few small outbuildings that had been stripped by retreating Serb forces. The other buildings were destroyed previously by bombing during Operation Allied Force.\n Initially the United States Marine Corps occupied the land during Operation Joint Guardian setting up camp around the main building in tents and in their vehicles, and patrolling Gjilan and the surrounding villages. In July 1999, U.S. Navy Seabees, along with Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), began construction of more permanent structures, with plumbing and electricity including a vast number of semi-permanent barracks known as South East Asia huts (SEAhuts). The camp continued to be used by peacekeeping forces up until early 2006 when the remaining soldiers relocated to Camp Bondsteel. The camp was closed in March 2007 to U.S. personnel and as of July 2007 has been transferred to the Kosovo Security Force.",

  "/wiki/Royal_Thai_Air_Base_Nam_Phong": "The Royal Thai Air Base Nam Phong in Nam Phong District, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand was constructed in 1966-1967 during the Vietnam War by Utah Mining Company, originally to support EC-121 aircraft and potentially three tactical aircraft squadrons, but was ultimately completed as a \"bare base\" to support disbursal and theater force staging.:4,33\u201334 In June 1972 Nam Phong became a base of operations for United States Marine Corps air operations by Marine Aircraft Group 15, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n Elements of squadrons that had previously been located at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam were moved to Nam Phong starting in June 1972. The advance party that first arrived landed to find basically an airfield in the middle of the jungle. At that time the base consisted of a runway, parking apron, and a few wooden buildings. A United States Navy Seabee battalion (MCB 5) was soon clearing the jungle and some 10 man tents were hastily erected to sleep and work in. Since the conditions were rugged, the base soon came to be called \"The Rose Garden\" after the song by Lynn Anderson and the Marine recruiting campaign based on it, saying \"We never promised you a rose garden\" and depicting a Marine drill instructor addressing a terrified recruit.\n The squadrons in residence soon included H&MS-15, MABS-15, VMFA-115 and VMFA-232 with F-4 Phantom IIs, VMA(AW)-533 with A-6 Intruders, VMGR-152 with KC-130 Hercules, and H&MS-36, Det \"D\" with CH-46 Sea Knights.\n These were soon joined by 3rd Battalion 9th Marines. who served as the security element. Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 62 (MATCU 62) handled the airport traffic control operations, including the airport tower and GCA radar (Ground Controlled Approach). The military occupying \"The Rose Garden\" was designated Task Force Delta. The base included Marines, Navy medical and construction staff, some airmen (mostly cargo handers), and a six-man United States Army detachment from the 11th Signal Brigade (United States), which provided specialized communications security to the command from June to December 1972. There were also Thai military elements. The Rose Garden was active until September 1973, when all the military units returned to their home bases.:24\n During its operational occupation by U.S. forces, Nam Phong was used for air operations against targets in North Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. During this time, a small contingent of Marines remained in Da Nang to serve as a \"turn around crew\" It was their job to refuel and re-arm Marine aircraft for a second sortie to the North before returning to Nam Phong. This allowed the Marines to make two sorties per day per plane. It was also a primary divert airbase for battle damaged aircraft and those low on fuel.\n In May 1975 Nam Phong also received refugee flights evacuating Hmong from Long Tieng, Laos.\n Nam Phong today is a Royal Thai Air Force bombing range[citation needed]. Nevertheless, the World Aeronautical database states that the runway is still in use.[citation needed] There is no ICAO location indicator for the airfield.\nAn on-site visit in January 2019 by several Marine veterans of Task Force Delta report that the base was minimally staffed and the runway surface is in poor condition and would not support non-emergency fixed-wing aircraft use.",
