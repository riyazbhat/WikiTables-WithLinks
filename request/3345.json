  "/wiki/Sink_the_Bismarck!": "Sink the Bismarck! is a 1960 black-and-white CinemaScope British war film based on the book The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck by C. S. Forester. It stars Kenneth More and Dana Wynter and was directed by Lewis Gilbert. To date, it is the only film made that deals directly with the operations, chase and sinking of the battleship Bismarck by the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Although war films were common in the 1960s, Sink the Bismarck! was seen as something of an anomaly, with much of its time devoted to the unsung back-room planners as much as on the combatants themselves. Its historical accuracy, in particular, met with much praise despite a number of inconsistencies. Sink the Bismarck! was the inspiration for Johnny Horton's popular 1960 song, Sink the Bismarck. [Note 1]\nThe film had its Royal World Premiere in the presence of the Duke of Edinburgh at the Odeon Leicester Square on 11 February 1960.",

He did not win an individual Academy Award, but did receive an Academy Honorary Award, and 14 of his films were nominated for Oscars, including Network, which was nominated for ten and won four. According to The Encyclopedia of Hollywood Lumet was one of the most prolific filmmakers of the modern era, directing more than one movie a year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. Turner Classic Movies notes his strong direction of actors, vigorous storytelling and the social realism in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors. Lumet was also known as an actor's director, having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than any other director. Sean Connery, who acted in five of his films, considered him one of his favorite directors, and one who had that vision thing. A member of the maiden cohort of New York's Actors Studio, Lumet began his directorial career in Off-Broadway productions, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie, 12 Angry Men (1957), was a courtroom drama centered on a tense jury deliberation. Lumet subsequently divided his energies among political and social drama films, as well as adaptations of literary plays and novels, big stylish stories, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies.",

  "/wiki/Casino_Royale_(1967_film)": "Casino Royale is a 1967 spy comedy film originally produced by Columbia Pictures featuring an ensemble cast. It is loosely based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. The film stars David Niven as the original Bond, Sir James Bond 007. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and SMERSH. The film's tagline: Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond! refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be James Bond, namely, baccarat master Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers); millionaire spy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress); Bond's secretary Miss Moneypenny (Barbara Bouchet); Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), Bond's daughter by Mata Hari; and British agents Coop (Terence Cooper) and The Detainer (Daliah Lavi). Charles K. Feldman, the producer, had acquired the film rights in 1960 and had attempted to get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions Bond film; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, failed to come to terms. Believing that he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project. Casino Royale was released on 13 April 1967, two months prior to Eon's fifth Bond movie, You Only Live Twice. The film was a financial success, grossing over $41.7 million worldwide, and Burt Bacharach's musical score was praised, earning him an Oscar nomination for the song The Look of Love. Critical reception to Casino Royale, however, was generally negative, with many reviewers regarding it as a baffling, disorganized affair.",

  "/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger_(1969_film)": "Doppelg\u00e4nger is a 1969 British science-fiction film written by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and Donald James and directed by Robert Parrish. Filmed by the Andersons' production company Century 21, it stars Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl and Patrick Wymark. Outside Europe, it was released as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, the title by which it is now more commonly known. Set in 2069, the film concerns a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a newly-discovered planet that lies parallel to Earth on the other side of the Sun. The mission ends in disaster when one of the astronauts (Hendry) is killed, after which his colleague (Thinnes) realises that the planet is a mirror image of Earth. The first major live-action film to be produced by the Andersons - then best known for children's puppet television series such as Thunderbirds - Doppelg\u00e4nger was shot between July and October 1968 at Pinewood Studios and on location in England and Portugal. The relationship between Parrish and the Andersons became strained as filming progressed, while creative disagreements between Gerry Anderson and his business partner John Read, the film's director of photography, led to Read's dismissal from Century 21. Although the Andersons wrote adult themes into the script in an attempt to distinguish Doppelg\u00e4nger from their children's productions, cuts were needed to allow the film to be certified A by the British Board of Film Censors. Actors and props from the film were re-used during the production of the Andersons' first live-action TV series, UFO. Doppelg\u00e4nger premiered in August 1969 in the United States and October 1969 in the United Kingdom. While the film has been praised for its special effects and set design, some commentators have judged the parallel Earth premise to be clich\u00e9d and uninspired. Some of the plot devices and imagery have been viewed as poor pastiches of other science-fiction films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).",
