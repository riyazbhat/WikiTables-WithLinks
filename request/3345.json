  "/wiki/Sink_the_Bismarck!": "Sink the Bismarck! is a 1960 black-and-white CinemaScope British war film based on the book The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck by C. S. Forester. It stars Kenneth More and Dana Wynter and was directed by Lewis Gilbert. To date, it is the only film made that deals directly with the operations, chase and sinking of the battleship Bismarck by the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Although war films were common in the 1960s, Sink the Bismarck! was seen as something of an anomaly, with much of its time devoted to the unsung back-room planners as much as on the combatants themselves. Its historical accuracy, in particular, met with much praise despite a number of inconsistencies. Sink the Bismarck!",
