Although a box office bomb, only grossing 65.9 million, the film received favorable reviews from critics.\n The companion film Letters from Iwo Jima was released in Japan on December 9, 2006, and in the United States on December 20, 2006, two months after the release of Flags of Our Fathers on October 20, 2006.",
