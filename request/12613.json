  "/wiki/Keauhou_Holua_Slide": "K\u0101neaka H\u014dlua Slide  which is better known today as the Keauhou H\u014dlua Slide is located in Keauhou (original name of this area was Kahalu\u02bbu) on the island of Hawai\u02bbi.  It is the largest remaining h\u014dlua course left in the islands, which needs to be better maintained and preserved as a usable h\u014dlua course. This particular kahua h\u014dlua (h\u014dlua slide) was used in the extremely dangerous activity of sliding across solidified lava surface. Though many had believed for years that this ritualistic practice was restricted to the ali\u02bbi class of men, this is not the case. The majority of oral and written histories of he\u02bbeh\u014dlua prior to missionary/western influence was inclusive of the female as well as the male nobility of ancient Hawaii.  Contrary to popular belief, he\u02bbeh\u014dlua was widely practiced among all the Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) community throughout the pae\u02bb\u0101ina (Kingdom). This particular h\u014dlua course was primarily used for ritualistic purposes, but perhaps there were times when it was openly used. There are several burials found throughout the slide area suggesting that injuries and death were common when sliding down this particular course. The remaining length of the slide is approx. 2,600 feet (790\u00a0m) long, of the original length which was said to be over 5,280 feet (1,600\u00a0m) long. The slide course ended on the shoreline at He\u02bbeia Bay. Small portions of the h\u014dlua course are still remain on the shoreline at the end of the h\u014dlua slide where the waves meet the rock coastline. When constructed it was first layered with large slabs of p\u0101hoehoe lava with smaller and smaller lava material added until the kahua h\u014dlua was finished off with a fine ash surface to cover those larger pieces of lava rock. When in use, it was covered lightly with pili grass (native to the islands) to provide a medium surface to minimize the friction between the papah\u014dlua and lava rock surface during the practice of he\u02bbeh\u014dlua. Today, there is one usable kahua h\u014dlua slide that was constructed in 2011 and is located at Turtle Bay Resort, Kahuku, O\u02bbahu. Other than that he\u02bbeh\u014dlua is practiced today in pastures on the high slopes of Hawai\u02bbi Island and Maui, as well as on groomed grass hills throughout Hawai\u02bbi.",

The sled is used standing up, lying down, or kneeling, to ride down man-made or naturally occurring courses (kahua h\u014dlua) of rock, often reaching speeds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) or greater.
