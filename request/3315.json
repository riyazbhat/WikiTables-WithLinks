The Center (the largest of its type in the state, and one of the largest in North America) receives between 100\u2013200 birds a year, with many suffering from gunshot wounds and traffic accident-related trauma. Most of the birds arriving at the center arrive in special containers, having been flown in via the baggage compartments of Alaska Airlines planes. The Center's goal is to introduce the birds back into the wild, once they are healed and retrained in raptor life skills (such as flying) in the enclosed, 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) Bald Eagle Flight-Training Center. Many birds that are no longer able to live outside captivity are sent to zoos and wildlife centers located throughout the United States.
