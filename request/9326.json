  "/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower": "The Parable of the Sower (sometimes called the Parable of the Soils) is a parable of Jesus found in the three  Synoptic Gospels in Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, and Luke 8:4-15. Speaking to a large crowd, Jesus tells of a farmer who sows seed and does so indiscriminately. Some seed falls on the path (wayside) with no soil, some on rocky ground with little soil, some on soil which contains thorns, and some on good soil. In the first three cases the seed is taken away or fails to produce a crop, but when it falls on good soil it grows, yielding thirty, sixty, or a hundredfold. Later, Jesus explains to his disciples that the seed represents the Gospel, the sower represents anyone who proclaims it, and the various soils represent people's responses to it (the first three representing rejection while the last one represents acceptance).",
  "/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas": "The Gospel of Thomas (also known as the Coptic Gospel of Thomas) is a non-canonical sayings gospel. It was discovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in December 1945 among a group of books known as the Nag Hammadi library. Scholars speculate that the works were buried in response to a letter from Bishop Athanasius declaring a strict canon of Christian scripture. Scholars have proposed dates of composition as early as 60 AD and as late as 140 AD. The Coptic-language text, the second of seven contained in what modern-day scholars have designated as Codex II, is composed of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus. Almost half of these sayings resemble those found in the canonical gospels, while it is speculated that the other sayings were added from Gnostic tradition. Its place of origin may have been Syria, where Thomasine traditions were strong. The introduction states: These are the hidden words that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down.",
  "/wiki/First_Epistle_of_Clement": "The First Epistle of Clement (Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, romanized: Kl\u0113mentos pros Korinthious, lit. 'Clement to Corinthians') is a letter addressed to the Christians in the city of Corinth. The letter was composed at some time between AD 70 and AD 140, most likely around 96. It ranks with Didache as one of the earliest\u2014if not the earliest\u2014of extant Christian documents outside the canonical New Testament. As the name suggests, a Second Epistle of Clement is known, but this is a later work by a different author. Neither 1 nor 2 Clement are part of the canonical New Testament, but they are part of the Apostolic Fathers collection. The letter is a response to events in Corinth, where the congregation had deposed certain elders (presbyters). The author called on the congregation to repent, to restore the elders to their position, and to obey their superiors.",
  "/wiki/Parable_of_the_Tares": "The Parable of the Tares (also known as the Parable of the Weeds, Parable of the Wheat and Tares, Parable of the Wheat and Weeds, or the Parable of the Weeds in the Grain) is a parable of Jesus which appears in Matthew 13:24-13:30, following the Parable of the Sower, and preceding the Parable of the Mustard Seed. The parable relates how servants eager to pull up the tares were warned that in so doing they would root out the wheat as well and were told to let both grow together until the harvest. According to the interpretation supplied in Matthew 13:36-13:43, the parable's meaning is that the sons of the evil one (the tares or weeds) will be separated from the sons of the kingdom (the wheat) at the end of the age (the harvest) by angels. This is usually taken to refer to the separation of the unsaved sinners from the saved believers during the Last Judgment. A shorter, greatly compressed version of the parable is found without any interpretation in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas.",
