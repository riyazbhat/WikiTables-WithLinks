It stretches 828 kilometres (514\u00a0mi) from Windsor in the west to the Ontario\u2013Quebec border in the east. The part of Highway\u00a0401 that passes through Toronto is North America's busiest highway, and one of the widest.\nTogether with Quebec Autoroute 20, it forms the road transportation backbone of the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor, along which over half of Canada's population resides and is also a Core Route in the National Highway System of Canada.\nThe route is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) and patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police. The speed limit is 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) throughout its length, with the only exceptions the posted 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) limit westbound in Windsor and in most construction zones.\n By the end of 1952, three individual highways were numbered \"Highway\u00a0401\": the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway\u00a011 (Yonge Street); Highway\u00a02A between West Hill and Newcastle; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville, now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway. These three sections of highway were 11.8, 54.7 and 41.2\u00a0km, (7.3, 34.0 and 25.6\u00a0mi), respectively. In 1964, the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario\u2013Quebec border. In 1965 it was given a second designation, the Macdonald\u2013Cartier Freeway, in honour of two Fathers of Confederation. At the end of 1968, the Gananoque\u2013Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade-separated near Kingston, making Highway\u00a0401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length. On August 24, 2007, the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway\u00a0/ Highway\u00a0404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes, as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner's office in Toronto. On September 27, 2013, the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto, to coincide with the move of the coroner's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner's Complex at the Humber River Hospital.\n In 2011, construction began on a westward extension called the \"Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway\". This new route follows but does not replace, the former Highway\u00a03 between the former end of the freeway and the E. C. Row Expressway, at which point it turns and parallels that route towards the site of the future Gordie Howe International Bridge. An 8-kilometre (5\u00a0mi) section of the parkway, east of the E. C. Row interchange, opened on June 28, 2015, with the remaining section completed and opened on November 21.  In summer 2019, widening of the highway between Highway/Regional Road 8 in Kitchener to Highway/Regional Road 24 in Cambridge to 12 lanes was completed.

Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of  9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\nPeople have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation. The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2\u00a0km2 (243.3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.\n Toronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, the CN Tower.\n The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.",

However, due in part to the construction of Highways\u00a0402 and 407, the province transferred the sections of Highway\u00a07 west of London and through the Greater Toronto Area to county and regional jurisdiction. The highway is now 535.7\u00a0km (332.9\u00a0mi) long; the western segment begins at Highway\u00a04 north of London and extends 154.1\u00a0km (95.8\u00a0mi) to Georgetown, while the eastern segment begins at Donald Cousens Parkway in Markham and extends 381.6\u00a0km (237.1\u00a0mi) to Highway\u00a0417 in Ottawa.\n Highway\u00a07 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year. Between 1927 and 1932, the highway was more than doubled in length as it was gradually extended eastward to Perth, where Highway\u00a015 continued to Ottawa. In the early 1960s, that section of Highway\u00a015 was renumbered as Highway\u00a07. In that same decade, the Conestoga Parkway through Kitchener and the Peterborough Bypass were constructed. During the 1970s and 1980s, many sections of Highway\u00a07 were widened from the initial two lane cross-section to four or six lanes. Within York Region, the route was upgraded to a limited-access expressway in preparation for the construction of Highway\u00a0407.\n Soon thereafter, that new tollway would act as justification for transferring the section of Highway\u00a07 through the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to regional governments. In the west, the construction of Highway\u00a0402 between Sarnia and London provided an uninterrupted alternative to Highway\u00a07, resulting in the transfer of the section west of Highway\u00a04. A third transfer took place in Peterborough, briefly separating the route into three discontinuous segments, but has since been rectified by renumbering a section of Highway\u00a07A. From 2007 to 2012, the section of Highway\u00a07 between Carleton Place and Ottawa has been widened to a divided freeway.

A large segment of the route follows the historic Talbot Trail, a settlement road following the northern shore of Lake Erie constructed by Colonel Talbot in the early 1800s as part of a grand settlement plan along the lake front. East of Canborough, the road generally follows older settlement trails: Forks Road, connecting Dunnville with Wainfleet, portions of Sherk's Road, through Port Colborne to Gasline, and the Garrison Road, a military road built west from Fort Erie.

The west end of the Murray Canal that leads east to the Bay of Quinte is at the east end of the town.\n The land upon which the present day town of Brighton is situated originally belonged to the Mississauga (Anishinaabe-speaking) peoples.\n Brighton later developed into primarily an agricultural community, specializing in the farming of apples and production of new apple types. However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival.\n The Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to over 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near Lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living.\n Presqu'ile Provincial Park, just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions.
