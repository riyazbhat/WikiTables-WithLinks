  "/wiki/Corned_beef": "Corned beef is salt-cured brisket of beef. The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also called corns of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are also added to corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines. Most recipes include nitrates or nitrites, which convert the natural myoglobin in steak to nitrosomyoglobin, giving it a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium botulinum bacteria spores, but have been shown to be linked to increased cancer risk. Beef cured without nitrates or nitrites has a gray color, and is sometimes called New England corned beef. Corned beef was popular during both World Wars, when fresh meat was rationed.",
  "/wiki/Marble_cake": "A marble cake is a cake with a streaked or mottled appearance (like marble) achieved by very lightly blending light and dark batter. It can be a mixture of vanilla and chocolate cake, in which case it is mainly vanilla, with streaks of chocolate. Other possibilities are strawberry or other fruit flavors, or (particularly in marbled coffee cakes) cinnamon or other spices. The first print references to marble cake begin appearing in the last quarter of the 19th century. One popular variation of this recipe during Victorian times was \u201cHarlequin cake,\u201d which was baked with checkerboard patterns. Early recipes used molasses and spices to achieve the dark-colored batter. The world's largest marble cake was made for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, for an episode on Turkmenistan's authoritarian president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. It is a 600 sq/ft cake featuring an edible image of Berdimuhamedow falling off a horse, with a marble-textured frame and red trimmings.",

  "/wiki/European_eel": "The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a species of eel, a snake-like, catadromous fish. They are normally around 60\u201380 cm (2.0\u20132.6 ft) and rarely reach more than 1 m (3 ft 3 in), but can reach a length of up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in exceptional cases. Eels have been important sources of food both as adults (including the famous jellied eels of East London) and as glass eels. Glass-eel fishing using basket traps has been of significant economic value in many river estuaries on the western seaboard of Europe. While the species' lifespan in the wild has not been determined, captive specimens have lived over 80 years. A specimen known as the Brantevik Eel lived for 155 years in the well of a family home in Brantevik, a fishing village in southern Sweden.",

One of Germany's 16 federal states, it is surrounded by Schleswig-Holstein to the north and Lower Saxony to the south. The city's metropolitan region is home to more than five million people. Hamburg lies on the River Elbe and two of its tributaries, the River Alster and the River Bille.

  "/wiki/Frikadelle": "Frikadelle are flat, pan-fried meatballs of minced meat, often likened to the Danish version of meatballs. The origin of the dish is unknown. The term frikadelle is German but the dish is associated with, not only German, but also Danish cuisine (or Scandinavian cuisine in general). They are one of the most popular meals in Poland. Through cultural exchange, frikadelle have also entered national cuisines of other European countries, such as the Faroe Islands and Norway.

  "/wiki/Shrimp": "Shrimp are decapod crustaceans with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion \u2013 most commonly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. More narrow definitions may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species. Under a broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers (antennae), and slender legs. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one. They swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens, although their escape response is typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them backwards very quickly. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin, fragile legs which they use primarily for perching. Shrimp are widespread and abundant. There are thousands of species adapted to a wide range of habitats.",
