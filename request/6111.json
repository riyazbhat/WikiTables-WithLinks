Prior to that, he was formerly a professional soccer player, who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer. Barclay initially skipped college, opting instead to sign a Project-40 contract with MLS in 2001, at the age of 18, which allocated him to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Barclay made a significant impact on a very bad Mutiny team as a rookie, appearing in 23 games, 12 starts, and scoring three goals and two assists. The Mutiny was contracted after the 2001 season; Barclay was selected 8th overall in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft by the San Jose Earthquakes. Barclay did not make much of an impact on the side that had just won MLS Cup, disappointingly only appearing in 12 games, and registering no goals or assists. He was traded to D.C. United in exchange for a draft pick, but disappointed in D.C. as well; he only appeared in three games for United, as coach Ray Hudson preferred not to play young players. He was again traded after the 2003 season, joining the Columbus Crew, his fourth team in four seasons. He made little impact on the Crew, however, again appearing in only three games in 2004. After appearing only once in the 2005 season, Barclay was released by Columbus on November 15, 2005. Barclay represented the U.S. national team at the Under-18, Under-20, and Under-23 levels, but his playing time with those teams dwindled as he was unable to break into an MLS side. Stifled by the lack of playing time and hampered by injuries, Barclay retired from soccer.",
  "/wiki/Nike_Project-40": "Generation Adidas is a joint venture between Major League Soccer and U.S. Soccer aimed at raising the level of young professional soccer talent in the United States. The program, sponsored by Adidas, offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the MLS SuperDraft early entry, allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing. From its establishment in 1997 to 2005, the program was sponsored by Nike and was called Project-40. Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool, American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry. Carlos Parra was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 1997. Since then, the program has included players such as Tim Howard, DaMarcus Beasley, Maurice Edu, Carlos Bocanegra, Clint Dempsey, Jozy Altidore, Ben Olsen, Sacha Kljestan, Freddy Adu, Brad Guzan, Michael Bradley, Nick Rimando and Kyle Beckerman. Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as professional, and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out. From 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the A-League in the USL. In 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the Canadian Soccer Association.
