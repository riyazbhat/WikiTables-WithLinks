  "/wiki/Whitewater_River_(Great_Miami_River)": "The Whitewater River is a 101-mile-long (163\u00a0km) southerly flowing right tributary of the Great Miami River in southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio in the United States. It is formed by the confluence of two forks, the West Fork and East Fork. The name is a misnomer, as there is no true white water on the river. However, there are many rapids due to the steep gradient present - the river falls an average of six feet per mile (1.1\u00a0m/km). The gradient rendered upstream navigation impossible, and in the mid-nineteenth century resulted in the construction of the Whitewater Canal paralleling the river from north of Connersville, Indiana, to the Ohio River.",
