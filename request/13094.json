  "/wiki/Science_fiction": "Science fiction (sometimes called sci-fi or just SF) is a genre of speculative fiction that typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the \"literature of ideas\", and often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.\n Science fiction, whose roots go back to ancient times, is related to fantasy, horror, and superhero fiction, and contains many subgenres. However its exact definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, and scholars.\n Science fiction literature, film, television, and other media have become popular and influential over much of the world.  Besides providing entertainment, it can also criticize present-day society, and is often said to inspire a \"sense of wonder\".",
  "/wiki/Fantasy": "Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe, often inspired by real world myth and folklore. Its roots are in oral traditions, which then became fantasy literature and drama.

In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a medieval nature. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works.",
