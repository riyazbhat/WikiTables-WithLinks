  "/wiki/Aquinas_College_(Michigan)": "The Congregation of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers (Dominican Order), today commonly known as the \"Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids\", Michigan, led by Mother Aquinata Fiegler, OP, founded the Roman Catholic Novitiate Normal School in Traverse City, Michigan in 1886. The School's mission was to educate young women who had yet to make their vows in the Order of Preachers, i. e., \"novitiates\", to be parochial elementary school teachers throughout Michigan, and it trained and sent forth numerous sister teachers successfully. In 1911 the School was transferred to Grand Rapids, along with the motherhouse of the Sisters, pursuant to an invitation of the Bishop of the young Diocese of Grand Rapids.\n In response to the need for their sister teachers to hold baccalaureate degrees, in 1922 the Sisters reorganized the Novitiate Normal School as Sacred Heart College and also commenced admitting lay women. The State of Michigan granted a charter to award two-year degrees to women to the new College in the same year. The site of the new College was transferred to the newly erected motherhouse of the Sisters on East Fulton Street, in the margins of Grand Rapids. At some time between 1922 and 1931 it was renamed as Marywood College. In 1931, it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College, transferred to a site on Ransom Street adjacent to the Grand Rapids Public Library, and became the first Roman Catholic college in the United States governed by women religious to become coeducational. Bishop Joseph G. Pinten of Grand Rapids instigated the reform to admit men alongside women. At that time it awarded two-year degrees.\n In 1939 Catholic Junior College added a third year to its curriculum. The College began awarding four-year baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Aquinas College in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas, OP and its founder, Mother Aquinata Fiegler, OP, in 1940, but the articles of incorporation to legally effect the institutional change were not filed with the State of Michigan until 1941. In 1945, Mother Euphrasia Sullivan, OP executed for the College the purchase of the Holmdene Mansion, erected by Edward Lowe in 1908, and its arboreal lands, at 1607 Robinson Road, bordering East Fulton Street. The College relocated to the former Lowe estate where it is sited to this day. The North Central Association accredited it in 1946.\n In 1948 students instituted a chapter of the Dominican Third (Secular) Order (tertiaries; TOP). In May 1950 the outdoor Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima was dedicated, in memory of the members of Aquinas College who sacrificed their lives in the Second World War, after a student and alumni campaign of two years.\n The 1950s and 1960s were a period of great growth and construction, and during them the College abandoned and sold the original campus on Ransom Street. In 1955 the new Administration Building, now the \"Academic Building\", was erected.\n In 1974 the College became legally independent of the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids. In 1975 the name of the athletic teams was changed from the \"Tommies\" to the \"Saints\", pursuant to a student poll, because African American members had been racially ridiculed as \"Toms\".\n In 1977 the College was accredited to award its first graduate degree, the Master's of Management in business, which was distinct from the conventional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree awarded by other institutions because it was primarily based on the humanities and not mathematics. In 1993 the College awarded its first doctorate degree, albeit honoris causa.\n Also in 1997, the College officially named its mascot, a St. Bernard (dog), \"Nelson\" in honor of President Paul Nelson, who retired that year. In 1998 the College was reorganized into three \"schools\", each led by a \"dean\" and subdivided into departments: the School of Education, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the School of Management.",
