  "/wiki/List_of_teams_and_cyclists_in_the_2010_Giro_d'Italia": "The 2010 Giro d'Italia began on May 8 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and ended on May 30 in Verona. Twenty-two professional cycling teams entered the race, who each entered a squad of nine riders. This group includes 15 UCI ProTour teams and seven UCI Professional Continental teams. Sixteen teams were guaranteed entry by a September 2008 contract between the UCI and the organizers of the season's three Grand Tours. Two from this group \u2013 Euskaltel\u2013Euskadi and Fran\u00e7aise des Jeux \u2013 declined to participate in the race, freeing up spots for two more teams. Two new teams joined the ProTour in 2010, but only one, Team Sky, participated in the Giro, as Team RadioShack opted instead to send their best riders to the 2010 Tour of California, which was partly concurrent to the Giro."
