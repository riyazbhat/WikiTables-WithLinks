After centuries of successive rule by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I.",

New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.",
  "/wiki/List_of_teams_and_cyclists_in_the_2010_Giro_d'Italia": "The 2010 Giro d'Italia began on May 8 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and ended on May 30 in Verona. Twenty-two professional cycling teams entered the race, who each entered a squad of nine riders. This group includes 15 UCI ProTour teams and seven UCI Professional Continental teams. Sixteen teams were guaranteed entry by a September 2008 contract between the UCI and the organizers of the season's three Grand Tours. Two from this group \u2013 Euskaltel\u2013Euskadi and Fran\u00e7aise des Jeux \u2013 declined to participate in the race, freeing up spots for two more teams. Two new teams joined the ProTour in 2010, but only one, Team Sky, participated in the Giro, as Team RadioShack opted instead to send their best riders to the 2010 Tour of California, which was partly concurrent to the Giro. Of the seven Professional Continental teams in the race, two, Bbox Bouygues Telecom and Cofidis, were covered by the September 2008 contract, as they were members of the ProTour at that time. The other five Professional Continental teams had to be selected by race organizers."
