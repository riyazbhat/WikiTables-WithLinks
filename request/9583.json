  "/wiki/Cathedral_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Angels": "The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (Spanish: Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los \u00c1ngeles), informally known as COLA or the Los Angeles Cathedral, is a cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles, California, United States of America. Opened in 2002, it serves as the mother church for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, as well as the seat of Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez.\n The structure replaced the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, which was severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Under Cardinal Roger Mahony, Our Lady of the Angels was begun in 1998 and formally opened in September 2002. There was considerable controversy over both its deconstructivist and modern  design and exceptional costs incurred in its construction and furnishing, as well as the archdiocese's decision to build a crypt under the Cathedral.\n The Cathedral is named in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the patronal title of Our Lady of the Angels, echoing the full name of the original settlement of Los Angeles (Spanish: El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, or \"The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels\"). The Cathedral is widely known for enshrining the relics of Saint Vibiana and tilma piece of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It is the mother church to approximately five million professed Catholics in the archdiocese.",
