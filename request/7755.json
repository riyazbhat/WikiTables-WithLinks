  "/wiki/Order_of_battle_for_Convoy_SC_7": "Convoy SC 7 was the seventh of the SC convoys, bound from Sydney, Nova Scotia across the \nNorth Atlantic to a number of British ports, mainly Liverpool.  They were designated SC as their departure point was designated Sydney, Cape Breton in order to avoid confusion with Sydney in Australia. The convoys formed part of the battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War.  Large numbers of merchants travelled together with naval escorts to protect against U-boat attacks. They were often slow, the merchants often only being capable of a speed of around 8 knots (15\u00a0km/h; 9.2\u00a0mph) and so were particularly vulnerable to attack.  This problem was exacerbated by a shortage of suitable escorts from either the Royal Canadian Navy or the Royal Navy in the early stages of the war."
