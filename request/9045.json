Initially, neither candidate would withdraw, but the trades council convinced the ILP to drop Hartley's candidacy.

  "/wiki/Arthur_Charles_Bannington": "Arthur Charles Bannington (1 December 1878 - 4 February 1951), sometimes known as Charlie Bannington, was a British political activist. A carpenter and joiner by trade, Bannington was born in Birmingham, the fourth child of Thomas and Alice Bannington. Living in Coventry, Bannington came to prominence as a member of the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF). At the January 1910 general election, he stood for the SDF in Carlisle. Although he visited on several occasions, his campaign was hampered as he was unable to take much time off work to visit the seat, so William Gallacher deputised for him. He took 11.3% of the vote and was not elected. The SDF became the British Socialist Party (BSP), and it locally affiliated to the Labour Party. Under this label, in 1913, Bannington was elected to Coventry City Council, defeating a long-standing Liberal Party councillor. The BSP soon disaffiliated from Labour, with Bannington's departure considered the greatest loss. In 1916, the BSP adopted a position opposing British involvement in World War I. Bannington strongly objected to this and resigned from the party, joining the Army Tank Corps. He rose to the rank of sergeant, but was invalided out in 1918, suffering with shell shock.

In 1892, Irving worked with Herbert V. Mills in an attempt to start a utopian socialist community at Starnthwaite, but this soon disintegrated, and Irving eventually won a legal case against Mills. Instead, he became a socialist lecturer, and then in 1894, secretary of the Burnley branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Burnley was one of the SDF's most important branches, and Irving kept its profile high. In the 1906 general election, SDF leader H. M. Hyndman stood in the Burnley constituency, and came within 350 votes of winning the seat. In 1902, Irving was elected to Burnley Town Council, a post he held (with one gap) until 1922.
