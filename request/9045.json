  "/wiki/Edward_Hartley": "Edward Robertshaw Hartley (25 May 1855 \u2013 18 January 1918) was a British socialist politician.\n Hartley began work in a mill at the age of ten, before becoming a warehouse clerk and then a butcher.  He became an active socialist in 1885, in reaction to serious unemployment in his home town of Bradford.  He was a founder member of the Bradford Labour Union and the Independent Labour Party (ILP).:306 He stood for the party in Dewsbury at the 1895 general election, taking 10.4% of the vote, but was not elected.:128\u2013130 However, he did gain election to Bradford City Council that year, representing Manningham, and held his seat for over a decade.  At the 1900 general election, he was nominated in Pudsey, but withdrew on the eve of the poll.\n Hartley was intended as the ILP candidate for the 1902 Dewsbury by-election, with the support of the local trades council and the Labour Representation Committee, but the rival Social Democratic Federation (SDF) nominated Harry Quelch.  Initially, neither candidate would withdraw, but the trades council convinced the ILP to drop Hartley's candidacy.  Quelch did not gain the support of the local labour movement, nor of the ILP leadership.  Angered by what he saw as pandering to the right-wing of the labour movement, Hartley actively supported Quelch's candidacy and joined the SDF.:138\u2013141 He founded a new SDF branch in Bradford, in 1904,:204 and was elected to the SDF's executive for seven years, using the position to advocate socialist unity.[page needed]  Yet he remained part of the ILP group on Bradford Council, and was re-elected on the ILP ticket in Bradford Moor in 1905.:327\n Hartley stood for the SDF in Bradford East at the 1906 general election, where he held joint meetings with Fred Jowett, Labour Party candidate for Bradford West, and he secured the support of the local ILP.  He won 22.8% of the vote, but again missed election.  He next stood for the party in the 1908 Newcastle by-election, then back in Bradford East in the January 1910 general election.:330\n From 1910 until 1912, Hartley was the secretary of The Clarion Van Movement.  He then toured Australia and New Zealand for eighteen months.[page needed] On his return, he stood in the 1913 Leicester by-election.  Sitting MP Ramsay MacDonald had persuaded the Labour Party not to stand a candidate, in the hope of a Liberal victory, but this enabled Hartley to attract the support of many ILP members, ultimately taking 11.4% of the vote.  On the outbreak of World War I, Hartley became strongly pro-war and left the SDF to join the British Workers League, in the process losing most of his political support.[page needed] He retired to Shelf, West Yorkshire where he died and is buried.[citation needed]",

Originally a conservative, he was converted to socialism by Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto, and launched Britain\u2019s first left-wing political party, the Democratic Federation, later known as the Social Democratic Federation, in 1881.

  "/wiki/Arthur_Charles_Bannington": "Arthur Charles Bannington (1 December 1878 \u2013 4 February 1951), sometimes known as Charlie Bannington, was a British political activist.\n A carpenter and joiner by trade, Bannington was born in Birmingham, the fourth child of Thomas and Alice Bannington.\n Living in Coventry, Bannington came to prominence as a member of the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF).  At the January 1910 general election, he stood for the SDF in Carlisle.  Although he visited on several occasions, his campaign was hampered as he was unable to take much time off work to visit the seat, so William Gallacher deputised for him.  He took 11.3% of the vote and was not elected.\n The SDF became the British Socialist Party (BSP), and it locally affiliated to the Labour Party.  Under this label, in 1913, Bannington was elected to Coventry City Council, defeating a long-standing Liberal Party councillor.  The BSP soon disaffiliated from Labour, with Bannington's departure considered the greatest loss.\n In 1916, the BSP adopted a position opposing British involvement in World War I.  Bannington strongly objected to this and resigned from the party, joining the Army Tank Corps.  He rose to the rank of sergeant, but was invalided out in 1918, suffering with shell shock.\n In Bannington's absence, other former BSP members in the city had formed a local branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers.  This adopted Bannington as its candidate for Coventry at the 1918 general election, and his campaign focused on attacking the official Labour Party candidate, R. C. Wallhead.  Wallhead was a member of the Independent Labour Party who had opposed the war, but he was able to remind crowds of anti-militarist statements made by Bannington before the war.  Ultimately, both candidates were defeated by Edward Manville, a Coalition Conservative politician; Bannington took 3,806 votes and fourth place in poll, behind Wallhead.  Soon afterwards, Bannington left the city, relocating to Oxford, where he devoted his time to the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers.",

  "/wiki/Dan_Irving": "David Daniel Irving (31 October 1854 \u2013 25 January 1924) was a British socialist activist and Labour Party Member of Parliament.\nBorn in Birmingham, Irving moved to Bristol in 1875, where he began working on the railways.  After he lost his leg in an industrial accident, the Midland Railway forced him to take a pay cut.  Angered by this injustice, he joined the Bristol Socialist Society and became an activist in a gasworkers' union, which soon merged into the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers.\n In 1892, Irving worked with Herbert V. Mills in an attempt to start a utopian socialist community at Starnthwaite, but this soon disintegrated, and Irving eventually won a legal case against Mills.  Instead, he became a socialist lecturer, and then in 1894, secretary of the Burnley branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF).\n Burnley was one of the SDF's most important branches, and Irving kept its profile high.  In the 1906 general election, SDF leader H. M. Hyndman stood in the Burnley constituency, and came within 350 votes of winning the seat.  In 1902, Irving was elected to Burnley Town Council, a post he held (with one gap) until 1922.\n In the 1906 election, Irving himself stood for Accrington; he then stood in the 1908 Manchester North West by-election, and in the January and December 1910 general elections he stood in Rochdale.  While his votes varied considerably, as an SDF candidate he never came close to winning a seat.\n In 1911, Irving followed the SDF into the formation of the British Socialist Party.  In 1914, he was a supporter of British action in World War I, and as a result, when the SDF split on the issue, he joined Hyndman's new group, the National Socialist Party.  This group affiliated to the Labour Party, and as a Labour candidate he was finally able to win a Parliamentary seat, taking Burnley in the 1918 general election.  He held the seat in 1922 and 1923, but remained a low-profile MP and died in 1924 aged 69.",

Debs in 1908, promoting the Industrial Workers of the World and speaking about socialism in Britain.
