The removal of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago occurred between 1968 and 1973.

As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland.\n Controversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, but Argentina maintains its claim to the islands. In April 1982, Argentine military forces invaded the islands. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War. Almost all Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory.

He or she also appoints Saint Helena's Executive Council, and, with some exceptions, is bound to seek and act in accordance with their advice.\n The Governor has his/her own flag in Saint Helena, the Union Flag defaced with the territory's coat of arms. The official residence, Plantation House, is located near the capital Jamestown, and the Governor's office is located within The Castle, along with the office of the Chief Secretary, who runs the day-to-day administrative part of the government.\n Before 2009 the territory was known as \"Saint Helena\", of which Ascension and Tristan da Cunha were dependencies. A new constitution which came into force in 2009 changed the name of the territory to \"Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\"; however, the Governor's title remained as the \"Governor of Saint Helena\". The Governor of Saint Helena nonetheless is the British monarch's representative across the territory.",
  "/wiki/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands": "South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) is a British Overseas Territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It is a remote and inhospitable collection of islands, consisting of South Georgia and a chain of smaller islands known as the South Sandwich Islands. South Georgia is 165 kilometres (103\u00a0mi) long and 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) wide and is by far the largest island in the territory. The South Sandwich Islands lie about 700 kilometres (430\u00a0mi) southeast of South Georgia. The territory's total land area is 3,903\u00a0km2 (1,507\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The Falkland Islands are about 1,300 kilometres (810\u00a0mi) west-northwest from its nearest point.\n No permanent native population lives in the South Sandwich Islands, and a very small non-permanent population resides on South Georgia. There are no scheduled passenger flights or ferries to or from the territory, although visits by cruise liners to South Georgia are increasingly popular, with several thousand visitors each summer.\n The United Kingdom claimed sovereignty over South Georgia in 1775 and the South Sandwich Islands in 1908. The territory of \"South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\" was formed in 1985; previously, it had been governed as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. Argentina claimed South Georgia in 1927 and claimed the South Sandwich Islands in 1938.\n Argentina maintained a naval station, Corbeta Uruguay, on Thule Island in the South Sandwich Islands from 1976 until 1982 when it was closed by the Royal Navy. The Argentine claim over South Georgia contributed to the 1982 Falklands War, during which Argentine forces briefly occupied the island. Argentina continues to claim sovereignty over South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.\n Toothfish are vital to the islands' economy; as a result, Toothfish Day is celebrated on 4 September as a bank holiday in the territory.",
  "/wiki/Commissioner_of_South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands": "The Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is the representative of the British monarch in the United Kingdom's overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The post is held in conjunction with the Governorship of the Falkland Islands.\n The post was created in 1985 when South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands was split from the Falkland Islands Dependencies to create a new overseas territory. As the territory has no native inhabitants, and the only population is the visiting military garrisons, and scientists from the British Antarctic Survey, there was no appointment of a governor. Instead the post of Commissioner was created, the normal practice for uninhabited territory. The post was to be held by the current Governor of the Falkland Islands, as that is the nearest inhabited overseas territory to SGSSI, and the presence of the Royal Navy in the South Atlantic allows the Commissioner to be transported to the territory relatively quickly if necessary.\n The Commissioner retains the same powers as a Governor, and is responsible for domestic affairs within the territory. The British Government retains responsibility for defence and international relations. The Commissioner has his own flag for the territory, a Union Flag defaced with the territory's coat of arms. The arms were authorised for the Commissioner on 14 February 1992.",
  "/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands": "The Turks and Caicos Islands (abbreviated TCI; /t\u025c\u02d0rks/ and /\u02c8ke\u026ak\u0259s, -ko\u028as, -k\u0252s/) are a British Overseas Territory consisting of the larger Caicos Islands and smaller Turks Islands, two groups of tropical islands in the Lucayan Archipelago of the Atlantic Ocean and northern West Indies. They are known primarily for tourism and as an offshore financial centre. The resident population was 31,458 as of 2012[update] of whom 23,769 live on Providenciales in the Caicos Islands; July 2018 estimates put the population at 53,700. It is the third largest of the British overseas territories by population.\n The Turks and Caicos Islands lie southeast of Mayaguana in The Bahamas island chain, northeast of Cuba, and north of the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Cockburn Town, the capital since 1766, is situated on Grand Turk Island about 1,042 kilometres (647\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Miami, United States. The islands have a total land area of 430 square kilometres (170\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[a]\n The Turks and Caicos Islands were inhabited for centuries by native Amerindian peoples. The first recorded European sighting of the islands occurred in 1512. In the subsequent centuries, the islands were claimed by several European powers, with the British Empire eventually gaining control. For many years the islands were governed indirectly through Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973, the islands received their own governor, and have remained a separate autonomous British Overseas Territory since.",
