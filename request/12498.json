The area is distinct from Bow, which lies immediately north and east of the formal boundary between the two, which runs along Bow Road, or near the Lea, slightly to the south of the Road. The area has become better known as Bromley-by-Bow due to Bromley tube station  being renamed to Bromley-by-Bow in 1967, to prevent confusion with Bromley railway station in the London Borough of Bromley. Over time the station's name has become applied to the district itself. The formal boundaries of the area were set when the area became an parish in 1537 when it split from Stepney. The boundaries of the new parish were based on those of much older pre-existing estates. Bromley has a rich history and historical ties with the Commonwealth of Nations, but many of its most historic buildings have been lost.

  "/wiki/Christ_Church,_Spitalfields": "Christ Church Spitalfields is an Anglican church built between 1714 and 1729 to a design by Nicholas Hawksmoor. On Commercial Street in the East End and in today's Central London it is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, on its western border facing the City of London, it was one of the first (and arguably one of the finest) of the so-called Commissioners' Churches built for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, which had been established by an Act of Parliament in 1711.\n The purpose of the Commission was to acquire sites and build fifty new churches to serve London's new settlements. This parish was carved out of the circa 1 square mile (2.6 km2) medieval Stepney parish for an area then dominated by Huguenots (French Protestants and other 'dissenters' who owed no allegiance to the Church of England and thus to the King) as a show of Anglican authority. Some Huguenots used it for baptisms, marriages and burials but not for everyday worship, preferring their own chapels (their chapels were severely plain compared with the bombastic English Baroque style of Christ Church) though increasingly they assimilated into English life and Anglican worship \u2013 which was in the eighteenth century relatively plain.\n The Commissioners for the new churches including Christopher Wren, Thomas Archer and John Vanbrugh appointed two surveyors, one of whom was Nicholas Hawksmoor. Only twelve of the planned fifty churches were built, of which six were designed by Hawksmoor.",
