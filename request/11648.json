From 1946 to 1949, the Browns won each of the league\u2019s four championships. While the National Football League (NFL) does not recognize the Browns\u2019 AAFC championships, the Pro Football Hall of Fame does recognize the team\u2019s championships, which is reflected in this list. When the AAFC folded in 1949, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. The Browns went on to win three NFL championships, nearly dominating the NFL in the 1950s, and won one more NFL championship in 1964. The team has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, however. Overall, the team has won eight championships: four in the AAFC, and four in the NFL.  \n In 1995, then-Browns owner Art Modell made the decision to move the team from Cleveland, Ohio to Baltimore, Maryland. An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team\u2019s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell\u2019s new team would be regarded as an expansion team. The Baltimore Ravens would begin play in 1996, and the Browns would return to the league in 1999. For record-keeping purposes, the Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998, which is reflected in this list.

It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The front office staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.\n The Buccaneers' only Super Bowl championship was won in Super Bowl XXXVII, at the conclusion of the 2002 season.

The second began in 1983 and ended in 1998. During this period, the Broncos had just two losing seasons, were AFC champions five times and were Super Bowl champions for two consecutive years. This second period of success is best remembered for John Elway being the team's quarterback. The most recent run of success began in 2011, lasting until their victory in Super Bowl 50 at the end of the 2015 season.

By chance, these two decades\u2014the 1970s and 1990s\u2014are the only decades in the Bears history that the franchise has not won or played for an NFL Championship or Super Bowl. In the 1969 season, the franchise posted their worst regular season record with a 1\u201313 showing.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Los_Angeles_Chargers_seasons": "The Los Angeles Chargers are a professional American football franchise based in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The Chargers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The club was founded in 1959 by Barron Hilton and played the 1960 season in Los Angeles as part of the American Football League (AFL). In the next season, the Chargers moved to San Diego. In 2017, the Chargers relocated back to the Los Angeles area.\n The franchise has experienced three major periods of success. The first was from 1960 to 1965, when the Chargers were AFL West champions five times and AFL champions once. The second was from 1978 to 1982, when the Chargers had winning seasons (seasons with more wins than losses) in each of these years, and won three consecutive division championships for the second time in franchise history. The most recent accomplishments range from 2004 to 2009, with the franchise reaching the playoffs five times in six years. Their only Super Bowl appearance was in 1994.\n The Chargers have experienced three notable periods of decline. Between 1970 and 1977, the Chargers never won more games than they lost as part of a 13-year period without playing in the postseason, including four consecutive years last in their division from 1972 to 1975, in which year they bottomed out before two late wins avoided the NFL's first 0\u201314 season. From 1983 to 1991, they never placed higher than third in their division and did not make the playoffs. From 1996 to 2003, the team had no winning seasons, and had their worst season ever, winning only one of 16 games in 2000.\n The Chargers have been division champions nine times including 2009, all of them in the AFC West. They have been conference champions six times, but only once since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. As of the end of the 2017 season, the Chargers had played 917 regular and post-season games in 58 seasons, and have appeared in the post-season seventeen times.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Indianapolis_Colts_seasons": "The Indianapolis Colts, formerly the Baltimore Colts, are an American football team playing in the National Football League (NFL). This list documents the season-by-season records of the Colts franchise from 1953 to present, including postseason records and league awards for individual players or head coaches. In 1953, a Baltimore-based group led by Carroll Rosenbloom gained the rights to a new Baltimore franchise. Rosenbloom was granted an NFL team, and was awarded the holdings of the defunct Dallas Texans organization. The new team was named the Colts after the previous team that folded after the 1950 NFL season. After 31 seasons in Baltimore, Colts owner Robert Irsay moved the team to Indianapolis, Indiana.\n The Colts have won two Super Bowl championships (Super Bowl V and Super Bowl XLI). They also played in and lost Super Bowl III and Super Bowl XLIV. Before the AFL and NFL merged in 1970, they won three NFL Championships (1958, 1959, and 1968). By winning Super Bowl XLI the Colts became the first team that played its home games in a domed stadium to win a Super Bowl held in an outdoor stadium.\n After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired Tony Dungy in 2002, the Colts made the playoffs for nine straight seasons. They won five straight AFC South titles from 2003 to 2007 and had seven consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories from 2003 to 2009, the first time that has been achieved in the NFL's 90-year history. Much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager Bill Polian, coach Dungy, and quarterback Peyton Manning.\n In the 2013 season, the Colts secured their first division championship since Manning's departure and first under quarterback Andrew Luck and head coach Chuck Pagano.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Dallas_Cowboys_seasons": "This article is a list of  known as the Dallas Cowboys American football franchise of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents the season-by-season records of the Cowboys' franchise from 1960 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches.  The Cowboys franchise was founded in 1960 as an expansion team. The team has earned 33 postseason appearances, most in the NFL, the longest consecutive streak of winning seasons with 20, the second-most appearances in the NFC Championship Game (14, behind the San Francisco 49ers' 15) and the second-most  Super Bowl appearances (8 with the Denver Broncos and Steelers). The Cowboys have played for 10 NFL Championships and have won 5, all five being Super Bowls.\n The Cowboys won Super Bowls VI, XII, XXVII, XXVIII and XXX. They also played in and lost Super Bowls V, X, and XIII.\n The franchise has experienced two major periods of continued success in their history.  The first period of success came from 1966\u20131985 when the Cowboys played in the postseason 18 times.  During this period, they played in two NFL Championships and five Super Bowls, winning two of them, winning a total of 20 playoff games.  The second period of success was between 1991\u20131996 when the Cowboys captured five straight NFC East Division titles and won three Super Bowls going 12\u20133 in the postseason.\n Outside of these two periods of success, the Cowboys have experienced  short periods of failure in their history. The three most notable periods of failure was from their 1960 inaugural season to 1965, during which the Cowboys did not have a single postseason appearance.  They did not win a single game during their first season, compiling an 0\u201311\u20131 record that is still the worst in franchise history.  Also, they did not have a single winning record in this period. \nBetween 1986 and 1990 the Cowboys had losing records in each season as veteran coach Landry retired and the team was radically overhauled, with the low point being the NFL's second 15-loss season (after the 1980 Saints) in 1989. After losing a Divisional playoff Game in 1996, the Cowboys between 1997 and 2008 lost five consecutive playoff games, one after a franchise-record 13\u20133 season in 2007, during which most predicted the Cowboys would break this streak. This streak finally came to an end when the Cowboys beat their bitter rival, the Philadelphia Eagles 34\u201314 after an 11\u20135 season in 2009.\n Nonetheless, through the 2018 NFL season, the Cowboys holds the league's all-time best winning percentage (.574) and has made more playoff appearances than any other NFL team (33). Also, of the 31 other franchises it has faced, Dallas leads the head to head series in 24 matchups, trail in 4 (Cleveland, Baltimore, Denver and Green Bay) and is tied in 3 others (Oakland, Miami and Los Angeles Rams).",
  "/wiki/List_of_Los_Angeles_Rams_seasons": "This article is a list of seasons completed by the Los Angeles Rams American football franchise (known as the Cleveland Rams from 1936 to 1945 and the St. Louis Rams from 1995 to 2015) in organized play. The list documents the season-by-season records of the Los Angeles Rams franchise from 1936 to present, including conference standings, division standings, postseason records, league awards for individual players or head coaches, and team awards for individual players. The Rams franchise was founded in Cleveland in 1936 when the team was playing in the newly formed American Football League (AFL). The franchise joined the National Football League (NFL) the following year. In 1943 operations were suspended due a depleted player roster due to World War II, and play resumed the following year. The Rams were the only team to suspend completely in 1943. The franchise has changed home cities three times: moving to Los Angeles in 1946, moving to St. Louis in 1995, and returning to Los Angeles in 2016.\n The franchise has had three periods of success in their history. The first period of came as the Cleveland Rams in NFL when they won the NFL Championship. This period continued until the 1950s as the Los Angeles Rams with them making the playoffs a further five times. The second period of success lasted over 20 years between 1966\u20131989 where the Rams made the playoffs 16 times and captured ten NFC Division titles including a then-record run of seven in a row from the 1973 season through the 1979 seasons (the New England Patriots broke the record with nine straight AFC East division titles from the 2009 season through the 2017 season). However, this period of success was marred by the fact that the franchise did not win the Super Bowl and only one Conference Championship. The most recent period of success began in 1999 as the St. Louis Rams when the Rams capped a surprisingly successful season (after going 4\u201312 the previous year) by winning Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. This period continued until 2004 but the franchise failed to win another Super Bowl and suffered a surprise defeat to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI.\n Alternating with their successful periods, the Rams have experienced severe periods of failure. As the NFL Cleveland Rams they failed to record a single winning season until their final year in the city, whilst from 1956 to 1965 they never won as many games as they lost and in 1962 won just one game. Between 1990 and 1998, affected in part by failure to obtain stadium improvements in Los Angeles and a move to Missouri, the Rams had nine consecutive losing seasons, and after the collapse of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" suffered thirteen consecutive seasons without a winning record between 2004 and 2016. Their three-season record between 2007 and 2009 of 6\u201342 was the worst over such a period between the Chicago Cardinals during World War II and the 4\u201344 Cleveland Browns from 2015 to 2017.\n Over the course of the Rams\u2019 71-year history, they have won 15 division titles. They have appeared in the postseason 27 times, winning four NFC Championships. During the Super Bowl era, they have played in four Super Bowls, winning one.",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIII": "Super Bowl LIII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2018 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams, 13\u20133. The game was played on February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. This was the first Super Bowl played at that stadium, and the third one held in Atlanta.\n The Patriots' victory was their sixth, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl championships. New England, after finishing the regular season with a 11\u20135 record, advanced to their 11th Super Bowl appearance, their fourth in five years, and their ninth under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Rams, who finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 record under 33-year-old head coach Sean McVay and third-year quarterback Jared Goff, advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance overall, and their first one since relocating back from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016. Super Bowl LIII was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI, a 20\u201317 Patriots win over the Rams that gave the Belichick\u2013Brady tandem its first Super Bowl championship. Coincidentally, the Patriots reached that Super Bowl with an 11\u20135 record as well. With the Rams now playing in Los Angeles, Super Bowl LIII marked the first Super Bowl appearance of a Los Angeles-based team since the then-Los Angeles Raiders' victory in Super Bowl XVIII and the Rams' first Super Bowl appearance as a Los Angeles-based team since Super Bowl XIV. This marked the 14th meeting in a major sports championship between the Los Angeles and Greater Boston areas.\n Super Bowl LIII was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl game in history, eclipsing the previous record of 14\u20137 held by Super Bowl VII, and the lowest-scoring league championship contest since a 14\u20130 score was recorded during the 1949 NFL Championship Game. It also marked the first Super Bowl with no touchdowns scored by either team in the first three quarters, as the Patriots and the Rams battled to a 3\u20133 tie as they entered the fourth quarter. New England then scored 10 unanswered points for the victory, as their lone touchdown tied them with the New York Jets in Super Bowl III for the fewest touchdowns by a winning Super Bowl team. The Rams ended up as only the second Super Bowl team to not score a touchdown, joining the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI. Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who caught 10 passes for 141 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP.\n The broadcast of the game on CBS, along with the halftime show headlined by U.S. pop group Maroon 5, saw the smallest Super Bowl audience in 10 years.",
  "/wiki/List_of_NFL_franchise_post-season_droughts": "This is a list of current National Football League (NFL) franchise post-season and Super Bowl droughts (multiple consecutive seasons of not winning). Listed here are both appearance droughts and winning droughts in almost every level of the NFL playoff system.\n As of the 2018 NFL season, every active NFL team has qualified for and won a game in the playoffs. Teams that have never made it beyond each successive milestone are listed under the year in which they began NFL play.\n Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl, four (4) are expansion franchises younger than the Super Bowl itself (Bengals, Panthers, Jaguars, and the Texans). The Falcons began playing during the season in which the Super Bowl was first played. The seven (7) other clubs (Cardinals, Lions, Oilers/Titans, Chargers, Browns, Bills, and Vikings) all won an NFL or AFL championship prior to the AFL\u2013NFL merger; in the case of the Vikings, however, the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their league title, leaving them and the Falcons as the only two teams to have existed for as long as or longer than the Super Bowl that have never secured the highest championship available to them. The longest drought since a championship of any kind is that of the Cardinals, at 72 seasons.\n Note that for continuity purposes, the Cleveland Browns are officially considered to have suspended operations for the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons. Since returning 21 years ago,  they have only made the playoffs once, while the Baltimore Ravens are considered to be a separate team that began play in 1996. The Ravens, as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, absorbed the Browns' personnel upon their suspension, but not their history."
