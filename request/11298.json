The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion teams during the league's expansion from six to twelve teams. The Penguins played in the Civic Arena, also known as The Igloo, from the time of their inception through the end of the 2009-10 season, when they moved to the Consol Energy Center, which was later renamed PPG Paints Arena. The 1992-93 Penguins won the franchise's first-ever Presidents' Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. In addition to their eight division titles, they have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times - in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among non-Original Six teams and sixth overall.

The season officially began its regular games on October 7, 2015, with a 3-1 loss against the Montreal Canadiens. Despite stretches of strong play, with the Maple Leafs at one point being within a few points of a playoff spot, they broke the franchise record for most losses in a season with 53 (the previous record was 52 in 1984-85). However, it is important to note the previous record was set when there were only 80 games per season (two have since been added, bringing the total games played yearly to 82 per team). Due to the point awarded for overtime and shootout losses, the Leafs finished the season with 69 points, one more than the previous season. Despite the improved record, the Maple Leafs finished last overall in the NHL standings for the first time since the 1984-85 season. On April 30, 2016, it was announced that the Leafs had won the draft lottery, and would receive the first overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. Auston Matthews was subsequently selected first overall. On July 1, 2015, the Maple Leafs were part of a blockbuster, multi-player deal that centred on Phil Kessel moving to the Pittsburgh Penguins, with one of the key pieces for Toronto being prospect Kasperi Kapanen. Kessel would be a central piece in the Penguins' Stanley Cup win later that season. Months later, another significant trade occurred when captain Dion Phaneuf plus four other players were traded to Ottawa Senators in exchange for four players plus a second round draft pick in 2017. A trade like this was seen as substantial due to the divisional Battle of Ontario rivalry and the NHL salary cap, which typically prevents more than a few players from moving at once.",
