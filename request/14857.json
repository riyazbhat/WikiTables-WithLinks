  "/wiki/Erfworld": "Erfworld was a story-driven fantasy/comedy webcomic and independent published graphic novel about a master strategy gamer summoned into and stuck inside a wargame running from December 2006 to its abrupt cancellation in October of 2019.\n Written with then current memes and pop culture references, the publication schedule was intermittent, rife with artist exits and changes and was an early pioneer in crowdfunding,  while simultaneously suffering from schedule creep and delivery issues.\n The first book, The Battle for Gobwin Knob was written by Rob Balder and illustrated by Jamie Noguchi. Erfworld was recognized as one of the top 10 graphic novels of 2007 by Time Magazine. The second book, Love is a Battlefield was illustrated by Xin Ye. Before his departure, David Hahn was the artist for much of the third book, Hamsterdance versus the Charlie Foxtrot, which will be completed by Xin Ye with colors and inks by Lauri Ahonen and Lillian Chen. A portion of the webcomic series has been animated, Ken-Burns-style, with voice-over work by Arthur Chu.\nErfworld follows a graphic novel format, with a new page added with each update. The setting is Erfworld, a fantasy world that adheres to the rules of a fictional turn-based strategy wargame. The narrative focuses on a complex story about warring factions within this world, but most installments also contain humor, puns, and side-gags about strategy-fantasy video games, role-playing games, and references to history or popular culture. The webcomic's distinctive visual style counters the theme of unending violence with a twee, kawaii artistic sensibility (described by the creators as \"cute\") in which characters are drawn to look like dolls, or anime characters, or toys. Injuries draw no blood in Erfworld, and damage is cured overnight. That same charming aesthetic follows in its lisping use of letter changes in frequently used names, particularly replacing \"r\" with \"w\" (spidews, dwagons, and twolls instead of spiders, dragons, and trolls).  The comic was originally started as an attempt to bring all of author Rob Balder's fantasy-related strips from his other comic, PartiallyClips, into the same universe and tell a story with them.\nErfworld's plot, setting, and characters are released under a Creative Commons Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike license.\n In May 2019, Balder announced that the comic would switch to 3D modeling: The stated goal of this change was to allow Rob himself to more easily create the images needed for the comic and hopefully return to a more rapid update schedule. In the same news post Rob explained that an undisclosed personal tragedy had occurred and, as a result, Erfworld would not be updating again \"for the foreseeable future, possibly the rest of the year.\" This new event was dubbed Horrible Thing II. None the less, updates did resume later in 2019.\n On October 11, 2019 the website's front page was replaced with an announcement, signed by Rob and Linda Balder, which announced the permanent end to Erfworld as a webcomic as a result of a string of personal tragedies. The Erfworld updates previously published remain available in an online archive.  All former functionality of the site was restricted to users with \"heartstrings\" badges. The authors have not yet publicly revealed what spurred the decision to shut down the comic.\nA few days later, the original copy of Book 1 was taken down from the GiantITP website.",
  "/wiki/Johnny_Wander": "Johnny Wander is a former webcomic written by Ananth Hirsh and illustrated by Yuko Ota. It was published bi-weekly. In its earlier days, the comic generally focused on slice of life stories involving Ananth, Yuko, and their friends and family following graduation from college. However, the comic occasionally encompasses unrelated fantasy storylines.  The comic is currently focusing on one of its ongoing fictional storylines, \"Barbarous.\" The name \"Johnny Wander\" is meant to evoke the creators' desire to use the comic to \"wander\" through whatever topics interest them at the moment.\n The webcomic has been generally well-received, with reviewers calling it as a humorous and sweet comic that invites new readers to continue reading. The artwork has also been praised for its depth and quality. The first physical book collection \"Johnny Wander Vol. 1: Don't Burn the House Down\" was published in 2010.",
