  "/wiki/Erfworld": "Erfworld was a story-driven fantasy/comedy webcomic and independent published graphic novel about a master strategy gamer summoned into and stuck inside a wargame running from December 2006 to its abrupt cancellation in October of 2019. Written with then current memes and pop culture references, the publication schedule was intermittent, rife with artist exits and changes and was an early pioneer in crowdfunding, while simultaneously suffering from schedule creep and delivery issues. The first book, The Battle for Gobwin Knob was written by Rob Balder and illustrated by Jamie Noguchi. Erfworld was recognized as one of the top 10 graphic novels of 2007 by Time Magazine. The second book, Love is a Battlefield was illustrated by Xin Ye. Before his departure, David Hahn was the artist for much of the third book, Hamsterdance versus the Charlie Foxtrot, which will be completed by Xin Ye with colors and inks by Lauri Ahonen and Lillian Chen. A portion of the webcomic series has been animated, Ken-Burns-style, with voice-over work by Arthur Chu. Erfworld follows a graphic novel format, with a new page added with each update. The setting is Erfworld, a fantasy world that adheres to the rules of a fictional turn-based strategy wargame. The narrative focuses on a complex story about warring factions within this world, but most installments also contain humor, puns, and side-gags about strategy-fantasy video games, role-playing games, and references to history or popular culture. The webcomic's distinctive visual style counters the theme of unending violence with a twee, kawaii artistic sensibility (described by the creators as cute) in which characters are drawn to look like dolls, or anime characters, or toys. Injuries draw no blood in Erfworld, and damage is cured overnight.",

However, the comic occasionally encompasses unrelated fantasy storylines. The comic is currently focusing on one of its ongoing fictional storylines, Barbarous.

The webcomic has been generally well-received, with reviewers calling it as a humorous and sweet comic that invites new readers to continue reading. The artwork has also been praised for its depth and quality. The first physical book collection Johnny Wander Vol. 1: Don't Burn the House Down was published in 2010.",
