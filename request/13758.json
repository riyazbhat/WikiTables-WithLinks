In the early days of the U.S. Highway System, US\u00a060 was originally to be numbered as US\u00a062. Following extensive lobbying and complaints filed by Kentucky governor William J. Fields to the American Association of State Highway Officials, the route was re-designated as US\u00a060 before the system was finalized. In Kentucky, US\u00a060 parallels the Ohio River (the northern boundary of the state). US\u00a060 enters Kentucky from Cairo, Illinois, traveling northeast to Louisville, then takes a direct eastward route (near Interstate 64, I-64) to rejoin the Ohio River in downtown Ashland, Kentucky. Both US\u00a060 and US\u00a023 run concurrently from Ashland to Catlettsburg where US\u00a060 turns east and enters Kenova, West Virginia.",
