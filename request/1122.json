Smith grew up in Pensacola, Florida and became the second-leading rusher in American high school football history while playing for Escambia High School. Smith played three years of college football for the Florida Gators, where he set numerous school rushing records. After being named a unanimous All-American in 1989, Smith chose to forgo his senior year of eligibility and play professionally. The Cowboys selected Smith in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft.

  "/wiki/1990_NFL_season": "The 1990 NFL season was the 71st regular season of the National Football League. To increase revenue, the league, for the first time since 1966, reinstated bye weeks, so that all NFL teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period. Furthermore, the playoff format was expanded from 10 teams to 12 teams by adding another wild card from each conference, thus adding two more contests to the postseason schedule; this format remains in use today (although there are now four division spots and two wild card spots available with realignment in 2002). During four out of the five previous seasons, at least one team with a 10\u20136 record missed the playoffs, including the 11\u20135 Denver Broncos in 1985; meanwhile, the 10\u20136 San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowl XXIII, leading for calls to expand the playoff format to ensure that 10\u20136 teams could compete for a Super Bowl win. Ironically, the first ever sixth-seeded playoff team would not have a 10\u20136 record, but instead, the New Orleans Saints, with an 8\u20138 record, took the new playoff spot. This was also the first full season for Paul Tagliabue as the league's Commissioner, after taking over from Pete Rozelle midway through the previous season.
