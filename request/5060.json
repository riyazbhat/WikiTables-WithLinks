Most of the seats in the stadium lack weather protection.\n Projects for a new stadium have been put forward, though issues with funding and location have stifled these plans. As a result, the stadium will be gradually redeveloped, with the first phase of improvements completed prior to the 2015\u201316 season, with future work to be carried out if a 99-year lease can be agreed with the city council.\n The first stage improvements included the removal of the pitch side barrier, one of the first Serie A clubs to make this change, along with improved bench facilities for players and the introduction of luxury boxes atop the grandstand. New seating areas for disabled spectators were also added. At the same time, the press box has been lowered and moved towards the pitch. These improvements came with a reduction in overall capacity by around 3,000 seats.\n Atalanta officially acquired the stadium on 8 August 2017, completing an \u20ac8.6 million transaction with the city government.
