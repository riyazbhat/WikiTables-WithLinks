It was home to the Providence Grays of the National League from 1878 to 1885 and of the minor league Providence Grays of the Eastern League in 1886. \n In 1878, the Providence Base Ball Association formed and began scouting around the city for a good location for \"the best baseball plant in the country\".  Team directors visited the old Josiah Chapin farm on city's west side and decided that it fit all of the requirements for a baseball park. It was close to level, it was raised up a few feet from the surrounding roads, and it was easily accessible by street car. \n Construction on Messer Park began on April 1 and took exactly one month to complete; the final nail was hammered a mere five minutes before the opening game got underway on May 1.",

  "/wiki/Troy_Trojans_(MLB_team)": "The Troy Trojans were a Major League Baseball team in the National League for four seasons from 1879 to 1882. Their home games were played at Putnam Grounds (1879) and Haymakers' Grounds (1880\u20131881) in the upstate New York city of Troy, and at Troy Ball Clubs Grounds (1882) across the Hudson in Watervliet, or \"West Troy\" as it was known at the time.\n The first Grand Slam home run in Major League history was hit by Roger Connor of this franchise in 1881 in East Albany (now known as Rensselaer) in what is now the Rensselaer Riverfront Park.  The site in present day Rensselaer was infrequently used to host games when their normal field was unavailable. A baseball diamond in the park is currently in use very close to where the diamond would have been back in the 1880s.  The site of the historic grand slam was only recently discovered as it was previously assumed to have occurred in eastern Albany. Overall, the franchise won 131 games and lost 194. The Trojans, along with the Worcester NL team, were expelled from the league shortly before the end of the 1882 season, as Troy and Worcester were seen as too small for the league's ambitions, but were encouraged to play out the rest of their seasons as lame-duck teams.\n On September 28, 1882, only six fans appeared to watch Worcester host the Trojans in the second-to-last game of the season, then only 25 arrived for the last game between the two teams. Among games that have had at least one paying attendee, the attendance figure of six is the lowest attendance ever recorded at a Major League baseball game. In 1883 the New York Gothams, later known as the Giants, took the Trojans' former slot in the National League. Four of the original Gotham players were former members of the disbanded Trojans, including three Hall of Famers: Buck Ewing, Roger Connor and Mickey Welch.\n A previous team named the Union Base Ball Club of Lansingburgh was organized in 1860, the successor to the Victories of Troy, and was a member of the National Association of Base Ball Players.  That team was given the nickname Haymakers by a defeated New York City team.\n Notable players for the Trojans included Hall of Famers Dan Brouthers, Connor, Ewing, Tim Keefe, and Welch.\n Another Troy Trojans minor league team continued play until at least 1916.",

After a one-year stint with the club, Radbourn joined the Providence Grays. During the 1884 season, Radbourn won 60 games, setting an MLB single-season record that has never been broken, or even seriously approached. He also led the National League (NL) in earned run average (ERA) and strikeouts to win the Triple Crown, and the Grays won the league championship. After the regular season, he helped the Grays win the 1884 World Series, pitching every inning of the three games.\n In 1885, when the Grays team folded, the roster was transferred to NL control, and Radbourn was claimed by the Boston Beaneaters.

  "/wiki/List_of_Providence_Grays_Opening_Day_starting_pitchers": "The Providence Grays were a Major League Baseball team that was based in Providence, Rhode Island and played in the National League from 1878 through 1885.  The Grays used four Opening Day starting pitchers in their eight years as a Major League Baseball franchise.  The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor that is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Grays had a record of five wins and three losses in their Opening Day games.\n The first game in Providence Grays history was played on May 1, 1878 against the Boston Red Caps (now known as the Atlanta Braves). Fred Corey was the Opening Day starting pitcher in that game, which the Grays lost by a score of 1\u20130.  The Grays' last Opening Day game was played on May 2, 1885 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Charles Radbourn was the Grays' Opening Day starting pitcher in that game, which the Grays won by a score of 8\u20132.\n Four pitchers made Opening Day starts for the Grays.  Baseball Hall of Famer Monte Ward made four Opening Day starts in the Grays' eight seasons.  Radbourne, also a Baseball Hall of Famer, made two Opening Day starts for the Grays.  Thus, in six of the Grays' eight seasons (75%), the Grays' Opening Day starting pitcher was a Baseball Hall of Famer.  Corey and Charlie Sweeney each made one Opening Day start for the Grays.\n In their history, the Grays won two National League championships, in 1879 and in 1884.  In 1884, the Grays went on to win the 19th century version of the World Series.  In both years, the Grays' Opening Day opponent was the Cleveland Blues.  In 1879, Ward was the Grays' Opening Day starting pitcher, in a game the Grays won by a score of 15\u20134.  In 1884, Radbourn \u2013 who was the Grays' Opening Day starting pitcher in both 1883 and 1885 \u2013 started 73 of the Grays 114 games.  However, the Grays Opening Day starting pitcher in 1884 was Sweeney, not Radbourn.  The Grays lost their Opening Day game that year by a score of 2\u20131."
