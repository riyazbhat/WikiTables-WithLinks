  "/wiki/Neale_Henderson": "Neale Henderson (June 24, 1930 \u2013 December 27, 2018) was an American Negro League Baseball shortstop. Henderson batted and threw right handed. He was nicknamed \"Bobo\".\n Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Henderson moved with his family to San Diego, California in 1941. In there, he honed his skills at San Diego High School, where he excelled in baseball, football and track and field, winning three titles as an infielder for the Coast League Baseball champion team  and two titles as the starting quarterback of the Coast League Football squad, becoming the first African-American quarterback to earn that accomplishment.\n His introduction to the Negro Leagues came early on in 1937, when he was seven years old, and was used as a batboy for the Kansas City Monarchs in an exhibition game against the Homestead Grays in Fort Smith.\n After graduating in 1949, Henderson signed with the Abilene Ikes, a farm team for the Monarchs. He was promoted to the big team in 1950, where he moved to outfield to make room for a shortstop prospect named Ernie Banks. Henderson was a competent outfielder for the Monarchs during two seasons. In addition, he played from 1951 through 1953 for the Kansas City Travelers, an independent club managed by Cool Papa Bell.\n Henderson ended his baseball career when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War. \nAt this time, he played for baseball and football teams at Camp Roberts in California and Fort Lewis in Washington. Following his discharge, he worked for 39 years at General Dynamics as a supervisor.\n In 2008, Major League Baseball staged a Special Draft of the surviving Negro League players, doing a tribute for the surviving Negro Leaguers who were kept out of the Big Leagues because of their race. Hall of Fame Baseball player Dave Winfield hatched the idea to have this draft, and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig and executive vice president Jimmie Lee Solomon also spearheaded the event, which was held before the 2008 MLB Draft. MLB clubs each selected a former NLB player, and Henderson was drafted as a shortstop by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\n In 2014, Henderson was honored at Petco Park on African American Heritage Night. After the ceremony, he explained in a TV interview about playing in the Negro Leagues.\n Henderson died in 2018 in San Diego, California, at the age of 88.",

They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. The Angels have played home games at Angel Stadium since 1966. The current MLB franchise was established as one of the league's first two expansion teams in 1961 by Gene Autry, the team's first owner. Autry was a famous singing cowboy actor in a series of films in the 1930s to 1950s, and later was the subject of the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum. \n The \"Angels\" name was taken by Autry in tribute to the previous original Los Angeles Angels, a Minor League franchise in the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which played in South Central Los Angeles from 1903 to 1957.  He bought the rights to the Angels name from Walter O'Malley, the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner, who acquired the PCL franchise from Philip K. Wrigley, also the owner of the parent Chicago Cubs at the time, as part of the Dodgers' move to Southern California.",
  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order. Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup. In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.\n More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position, as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly. Like a second baseman, a shortstop must be agile, for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play. Also, like a third baseman, the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield, where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base.",

Wilkinson, they were charter members of the Negro National League from 1920 to 1930. J. L. Wilkinson was the first Caucasian owner at the time of the establishment of the team. In 1930, the Monarchs became the first professional baseball team to use a portable lighting system which was transported from game to game in trucks  to play games at night, five years before any major league team did. The Monarchs won ten league championships before integration, and triumphed in the first Negro League World Series in 1924. The Monarchs had only one season in which they did not have a winning record. The team produced more major league players than any other Negro League franchise. It was  disbanded in 1965.",
  "/wiki/Hubert_Simmons": "Hubert Van Wike Simmons (May 19 1924 \u2013 July 8, 2009) was an American Negro League Baseball pitcher and outfielder. He batted and threw right handed.\n It is documented that Simmons could play all nine positions in baseball. Nevertheless, he was basically a  curveball pitcher that later established his reputation for his nasty knuckleball.\n During his life, Simmons was considered to be an engaging individual, readily willing to share his experiences, talking to adults as well as kids, both African-Americans and white, about playing professional baseball and participating voluntarily in social activities. \n Simmons was born and raised in Tarboro, North Carolina. He grew up watching the likes of Soup Campbell, Snake Henry and Buster Maynard playing with the Class-D Tarboro Serpents at what was then called Bryan Park. Simmons had dreamed of playing on that same field since age seven, but segregation stood ominously in his path. At the time, it was a white park, with only white ball teams playing there. Neverthelees, Simmons learned to play baseball and watched games at the ballpark, which had separate seating for black people.\n After years of using foul balls as his golden ticket into Bryan Park, the teenager Simmons met a groundskeeper that allowed him to shine baseball shoes, and rake the basepaths and the field, which allowed Simmons to watch free the games of his local team.\n Because his high school did not have a baseball team, Simmons just played sandlot ball and in Boy Scout games around his hometown. After graduating from high school in 1941, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a public work relief program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that operated from 1933 to 1942. Simmons was relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he joined the Raleigh Tigers, a semipro team managed by legendary William 'Bill' Foster. \n Simmons spent his time with the Tigers from 1941 to 1942. Afterwards, he continued playing baseball for several teams through 1949, even while serving in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945 and later while attending college at A&T State in Greensboro, North Carolina between 1946 and 1949.\n In between, Simmons served in Europe with the Quartermaster Corps, arriving on the beaches of Normandy landings in June 1944 during the D-Day invasion. Discharged with the rank of sergeant at the end of the war, Simmons attended A&T, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1950. While a student at A&T, he was a member of three championship teams and twice made the all-conference team.\n In addition to the Raleigh Tigers, Simmons played for the Greensboro Red Wings (1946-1948), Farley Stars (1948), Asheville Blues (1949), and finally with the Baltimore Elite Giants of the Negro American League in 1950, in what would be the final season of the storied franchise. Simmons won one game in three pitching appearances for the Elites. After that, he played from 1951 to 1952 for the all-black Yokely Stars, an independent club based in Baltimore, Maryland.\n After retiring from baseball, Simmons settled in Baltimore and worked for the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Post Office before becoming a city school teacher in 1954. He then taught business at Northwestern High School and was appointed department chairman in 1975. He retired in 1984 ater 30 years of service in the Baltimore City Public School System. In his sparetime, he coached baseball at the Little League, high school and college levels for more than 40 years.\n Simmons later owned SimmonsInk, The Logo Specialists, an advertising specialties business, and opened a small sportswear retail store, Simmons Inc., specialized in customized clothing and uniforms for teams, churches, schools and fraternal organizations.\n In 1978, Simmons gained induction into the North Carolina A&T State University Sports Hall of Fame. Thereafter, he was recognized by the Mayor of the City of Baltimore for Outstanding Community Service. For years, he also participated in the Baltimore Orioles' FanFest, being honored in 2004 by throwing out the first pitch at an Orioles home game. \n Prior to the 2008 MLB Draft, the Baltimore Orioles  selected Simmons  as a pitcher in the  Special Draft of the surviving Negro League players. Baseball Hall of Fame player Dave Winfield hatched the idea to have this draft,  which allowed the MLB teams each select a former NLB player to rectify and recognize those ballplayers who did not have the opportunity to play in the major leagues on the basis of race.\n A few days later, the tireless Simmons, along with his wife Audrey L. Simmons and good friend Rayner Banks, gathered a group of relatives, friends, and acquaintances to meet and discuss plans for the development of a Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Baltimore. The timing was perfect as there was a rise in interest surrounding the Negro Leagues and its ball players after the Special Draft. As a result, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum of Maryland Inc. (NLBMM) became incorporated in the State of Maryland and was recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit, charitable corporation in September 2008.\n Soon after, Simmons continued a normal life until he suddenly became ill. He died on July 8, 2009 in Baltimore at the age of 85. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving player of the Baltimore Elite Giants.\n On March 27, 2014, Baltimore County officials, former Negro League Baseball players and fans formally unveiled the Hubert V. Simmons Museum of Negro Leagues Baseball (SMNLB) in the Owings Mills branch of the Baltimore County Public Library to honor Simmons. The previously named Negro Leagues Baseball Museum of Maryland Inc. had been housed in various temporary locations until the county offered to give it a permanent home in the newly founded BCPL branch.",

As one of the American League's eight charter teams in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri, to become the St. Louis Browns in 1902. After 52 years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current owner is American trial lawyer Peter Angelos.\n The Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including another AL charter member franchise also named the \"Baltimore Orioles,\" which moved north in 1903 to eventually become the New York Yankees. Nicknames for the team include the  \"O's\" and the \"Birds\".\n The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983, when they made six World Series appearances, winning three of them (1966, 1970, 1983). This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman Brooks Robinson, outfielder Frank Robinson, starting pitcher Jim Palmer, first baseman Eddie Murray, shortstop Cal Ripken Jr., and manager Earl Weaver. The Orioles have won a total of nine division championships (1969\u20131971, 1973\u20131974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014), six pennants (1966, 1969\u20131971, 1979, 1983), and three wild card berths (1996, 2012, 2016). Since moving to Baltimore in 1954, the franchise has a win-loss record of 5306-5174 (with a winning \"percentage\" of .506) as of the end of the 2019 season.\n After suffering a stretch of 14 straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011, the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette, including a division title and advancement to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 17 years in 2014. However, the 2018 team finished with a franchise-worst record of 47\u2013115, prompting the team to move on from Showalter and Duquette following the season's conclusion. The Orioles' current manager is Brandon Hyde, while Mike Elias serves as general manager and executive vice president.\n The Orioles are also well known for their influential ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which opened in 1992 in downtown Baltimore.",
  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer.\n Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position.",

These defenders are the left fielder, the center fielder, and the right fielder. As an outfielder, their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances, if there is any runners on the bases. As an outfielder, they normally play behind the six players located in the field.\nBy convention, each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered. The outfield positions are 7 (left field), 8 (center field) and 9 (right field).

In addition, they won the 1904 American League pennant, but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912. The \"Red Sox\" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, circa 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"Boston Red Stockings\", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves.\n The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history, dubbed the \"Curse of the Bambino\" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in 2004. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including Enos Slaughter's \"mad dash\" in 1946, the \"Impossible Dream\" of 1967, Carlton Fisk's home run in 1975, and Bill Buckner's error in 1986. Following their victory in the 2018 World Series, they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century, with championships in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2018. The team's history has also been marked by the team's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.\n The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group, which also owns Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League in England. They are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance. From May 15, 2003 to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game\u2014a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record.

Content with playing locally, it was not until after he received an offer to play in the Negro Leagues. Presswood then was assigned to the Cleveland Buckeyes in 1948 and immediately he was installed as their shortstop, playing alongside such greats as Webbo Clarke, Sam Jethroe and Sam 'Toothpick' Jones.\n It was a great step for the 26-year old rookie while joining the lineup of the defending champions of the Negro American League, just one year after Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, Hank Thompson, Willard Brown and Dan Bankhead had broken the color barrier in the Major Leagues. \n Presswood played with the Buckeyes until they folded in the 1950 season. Following a year off, he was picked up by the Kansas City Monarchs, who were managed by the legendary Buck O\u2019Neil. Presswood played with the Monarchs as a third baseman from 1952 to 1953, in a time when Ernie Banks was their regular shortstop.

The White Sox are owned by Jerry Reinsdorf, and play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South Side. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago Cubs of the National League (NL) Central division.\n One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the franchise was established as a major league baseball club in 1901. The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings, but this was soon shortened to Chicago White Sox. The team originally played home games at South Side Park before moving to Comiskey Park in 1910, where they played until Guaranteed Rate Field (originally known as Comiskey Park and then known as U.S. Cellular Field) opened in 1991.\n The White Sox won the 1906 World Series with a defense-oriented team dubbed \"the Hitless Wonders\", and the 1917 World Series led by Eddie Cicotte, Eddie Collins, and Shoeless Joe Jackson. The 1919 World Series was marred by the Black Sox Scandal, in which several members of the White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to fix games. In response, Major League Baseball's new Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned the players from Major League Baseball for life. In 1959, led by Early Wynn, Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and manager Al L\u00f3pez, the White Sox won the American League pennant.

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base \u2014  the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number '5'.\n The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, as he is often the closest infielder (roughly 90\u2013120 feet) to the batter. The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base. The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play. The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory.\n Third base is known as the \"hot corner\", because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction. A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour (201 km/h). Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected, creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply. As with middle infielders, right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base. Mike Squires, who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983, is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty. Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast.\n Expectations of how well a third baseman should be able to hit have varied a great deal over time; in the early years of the sport, these expectations were similar to those for shortstops, the third baseman being merely the less skilled defensive player. Players who could hit with more ability often were not suited for third base, either because they were left-handed or because they were not mobile enough for the position. However, the beginning of the live-ball era in the 1920s created a greater demand for more offense, and third basemen have since been expected to hit either for a high average (.290 or better) or with moderate to substantial power.  Since the 1950s the position has become more of a power position with sluggers such as Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Ron Santo becoming stars.\n There are fewer third basemen in the Baseball Hall of Fame than there are Hall of Famers of any other position. Furthermore, with the notable exception of John McGraw and Bobby Cox, few third basemen have gone on to have successful managing careers, with Jimmy Dykes and Negro Leaguer Dave Malarcher being perhaps the next most prominent managers who began their careers at third base.",

The team's spring training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona. Since their establishment as a major league franchise in 1901, the team has won 10 Central Division titles, six American League pennants, and two World Series championships, (in 1920 and 1948). The team's current 71-year World Series championship drought is the longest active among all 30 current Major League teams.\n The name \"Indians\" originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace \"Cleveland Naps\" following the departure of Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season. It was a revival of the nickname that fans gave to the Cleveland Spiders while Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, was playing for the team.  Common nicknames for the Indians include the \"Tribe\" and the \"Wahoos\", the latter referencing their former logo, Chief Wahoo. The team's mascot is named \"Slider.\"\n The franchise originated in 1894 as the Grand Rapids Rustlers, a minor league team in the Western League. The team relocated to Cleveland in 1900 and was renamed the Cleveland Lake Shores. The Western League itself was renamed the American League while continuing its minor league status.

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket, but in cricket, wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities.\n Positioned behind home plate, the catcher can see the whole field, and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.\n Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game's strategies, the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, including such prominent examples as Connie Mack, Steve O'Neill, Al L\u00f3pez, Mike Scioscia, and Joe Torre. The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season, and can have a negative effect on their offensive output.\n Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching, if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills, teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses. A knowledgeable catcher's ability to work with the pitcher, via pitch selection and location, can diminish the effectiveness of the opposing team's offense. Many great defensive catchers toiled in relative anonymity, because they did not produce large offensive numbers. Notable examples of light-hitting, defensive specialists were Ray Schalk, Jim Hegan, Jim Sundberg and Brad Ausmus. Schalk's career batting average of .253 is the lowest of any position player in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base, or 1B, is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player's team. A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\n Also called first sacker or cornerman, the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes. Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders, the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls. In order for the runner to be called out, the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base. First base is often referred to as \"the other hot corner\"\u2014the \"hot corner\" being third base\u2014and therefore, like the third baseman, he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line, mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field.

The team's board voted 6\u20131 on the name, with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman, who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him.\n Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots, the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman. The franchise was established following the actions of Stuart Symington, then-United States Senator from Missouri, who demanded a new franchise for the city after the Athletics (Kansas City's previous major league team that played from 1955 to 1967) moved to Oakland, California in 1968. Since April 10, 1973, the Royals have played at Kauffman Stadium, formerly known as Royals Stadium.\n The new team quickly became a powerhouse, appearing in the playoffs seven times from 1976 to 1985, winning one World Series championship and another AL pennant, led by stars such as Amos Otis, Hal McRae, John Mayberry, George Brett, Frank White, Willie Wilson, and Bret Saberhagen. The team remained competitive throughout the early 1990s, but then had only one winning season from 1995 to 2012. For 28 consecutive seasons (1986\u20132013), the Royals did not qualify to play in the MLB postseason, one of the longest postseason droughts during baseball's current wild-card era.

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball, second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play.   In addition, second basemen are usually right-handed; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.\n Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on, or moving towards the base to cover. On a batted ball to right field, the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay. Due to these requirements, second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game, but there are hitting stars as well.",

In addition, the team was originally owned by the Labatt Brewing Company, makers of the popular beer Labatt's Blue. Colloquially nicknamed the \"Jays\", the team's official colours are royal blue, navy blue, red, and white. An expansion franchise, the club was founded in Toronto in 1977. Originally based at Exhibition Stadium, the team began playing its home games at SkyDome upon its opening in 1989. Since 2000, the Blue Jays have been owned by Rogers Communications and in 2004, SkyDome was purchased by that company, which renamed it Rogers Centre.

In 1983, the team had its first winning season and two years later, they became division champions.

  "/wiki/Bob_Mitchell_(baseball)": "Bob Mitchell (November 12, 1932 \u2013 June 12, 2019) was an African American pitcher who played in Negro League Baseball.\n Born and raised in West Palm Beach, Florida, Mitchell was fascinated with baseball since he was an 11-year-old while watching the all-black West Palm Beach Yankees club, often through knotholes in the grandstand or earning a close-up look by selling peanuts. In his spare time, he swatted tennis balls with broom handles or just tuned his fastball tossing rocks at targets on train tracks.\n Mitchell graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1951. Even though he had an interest in writing, his main motivation was to play baseball. The same year, he made his bid for the Florida Negro League, winning a spot with his beloved West Palm Beach team. In 1952, he pitched for the Florida Cubans based in Lakeland, Florida, home field and training center of the major league Detroit Tigers. Mitchell spent two seasons with the team, including a showdown with the Kansas City Monarchs and a highly touted prospect named Ernie Banks. After the game, Mitchell was approached by the Monarchs manager Buck O'Neil, who showed interest in his pitching abilities. Mitchell then was invited to throw batting practice to the Monarchs and earned a contract to join the team, which had a strong pitching staff featuring the legendary Satchel Paige.\n Mitchell debuted with the Monarchs in 1954 and made his first appearance against the Indianapolis Clowns, in which he gave them a taste of his fastball and his curveball. That was also the first start of his four-year career with the Kansas City club. In 1956, Mitchell asked the then manager Jelly Taylor to let him pitch the game that evening in Canada, something pitchers did not do. Then he would proceed to pitch a complete game victory while striking out 13 batters in his nine innings of work. He finished his Negro American League career with a 30-14 record.\n Afterwards, Mitchell retired in 1957 to marry his pregnant fianc\u00e9. He then worked for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft United Technologies from 1964 to 1993. \n Yet Mitchell never forgot his former Negro League ballplayers, becoming an advocate for those men whose careers in the Negro Leagues did not pave the way for inclusion into organized baseball. In 1993, he successfully lobbied Major League Baseball for a pension plan for black players who were excluded after 1947, the year Jackie Robinson integrated white baseball, getting about 85 players were granted an annual pension. While some MLB teams added black players to their rosters during the decade after Robinson's breakthrough, most only signed one or two black players at a time. Those actions denied most Negro Leaguers the chance to show off their skills in the majors and also denied them the pensions afforded those players.\n But Mitchell persevered and continued the fight for those who continued playing in the Negro Leagues ball after 1947. As a result, additional black players became eligible to receive supplementary financial assistance from MLB in 2004, including survivor benefits for widows and supplementary financial assistance. As of late 2003, 41 Negro Leagues players were drawing the annual $10,000 pension while supplying health insurance for an additional 34 Negro Leagues players and spouses, included in the separate 1993 deal.\n In his third attempt to aid Negro Leaguers, Mitchell managed to get MLB to finally decide that players on segregated black baseball teams in the late 1940s and 1950s were discriminated against because the so-called white leagues did not fully integrate until 1959.\n Mitchell received his due recognition in 2008, when he was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the MLB Special Draft of the surviving Negro League players. Hall of Fame Baseball player Dave Winfield hatched the idea to have this draft while MLB clubs each selected a former NLB player.\n Furthermore, Mitchell settled in Tampa Bay, Florida and took an active role in teaching children the essentials of reading, writing, and arithmetic as well as moral values and the importance of faith. He died on June 12, 2019.",
