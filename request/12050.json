It turns on two indelicate plot devices: a rake's trick of pretending near impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women, and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young \"country wife\", with her discovery of the joys of town life, especially the fascinating London men.\nThe implied condition the Rake, Horner, claimed to suffer from was, he said, contracted in France whilst \"dealing with common women\".
