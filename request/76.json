  "/wiki/Electric_car": "An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries. The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles.\n From 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban air quality. Several national and local governments have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles, tax credits, subsidies, and other incentives to promote the introduction and adoption in the mass market of new electric vehicles, often depending on battery size, their electric range and purchase price. The current maximum tax credit allowed by the US Government is US$7,500 per car. Compared with internal combustion engine cars, electric cars are quieter, and have no tailpipe emissions and lower emissions in general. In January 2019 and updated in April, a Reuters analysis of 29 global automakers concluded that automakers are planning on spending $300 billion over the next 5 to 10 years on electric cars, with 45% of that investment projected to occur in China.\n Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations, these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas. The Tesla Model 3 was the world's best selling EV from 2018 to 2019 and had a maximum electric range of 500 km (310 miles) according to the EPA.\n As of December 2018[update], there were about 5.3 million light-duty all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in use around the world. Despite the rapid growth experienced, the global stock of plug-in electric cars represented just about 1 out of every 250 vehicles (0.40%) on the world's roads by the end of 2018. The plug-in car market is shifting towards fully electric battery vehicles, as the global ratio between annual sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) rose from 56:44 in 2012, to 60:40 in 2015, and 69:31 in 2018.",

The Impala is Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and is generally among the better selling American made automobiles in the United States.\n For its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-size model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8\u2013powered version of the Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan.\n In 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive car. As of February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked #1 among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings. When the tenth generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the ninth generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The current-generation Impala is also sold in the Middle East, China, and South Korea.",
  "/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle": "A hybrid electric vehicle  (HEV) is a type of hybrid vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE)  system with an electric propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better performance. There is a variety of HEV types, and the degree to which each functions as an electric vehicle (EV) also varies. The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) and buses also exist.\n Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving technologies such as regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's kinetic energy to electric energy, which is stored in a battery or supercapacitor. Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to turn an electrical generator, which either recharges the vehicle's batteries or directly powers its electric drive motors; this combination is known as a motor\u2013generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting down the engine at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less tailpipe emissions than a comparably sized gasoline car, since the hybrid's gasoline engine is usually smaller than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle. If the engine is not used to drive the car directly, it can be geared to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.\n Ferdinand Porsche developed the Lohner-Porsche in 1901. But hybrid electric vehicles did not become widely available until the release of the Toyota Prius in Japan in 1997, followed by the Honda Insight in 1999. Initially, hybrid seemed unnecessary due to the low cost of gasoline. Worldwide increases in the price of petroleum caused many automakers to release hybrids in the late 2000s; they are now perceived as a core segment of the automotive market of the future.\n As of January 2017[update], over 12 million hybrid electric vehicles have been sold worldwide since their inception in 1997. Japan has the world's largest hybrid electric vehicle fleet with 7.5 million hybrids registered as of March 2018[update]. Japan also has the world's highest hybrid market penetration with hybrids representing 19.0% of all passenger cars on the road as of March 2018[update], both figures excluding kei cars. As of April 2016[update], the U.S. ranked second with cumulative sales of over 4 million units since 1999, and Europe with about 1.5 million hybrids delivered since 2000.\n Global sales are led by the Toyota Motor Company with more than 10 million Lexus and Toyota hybrids sold as of January 2017[update], followed by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. with cumulative global sales of more than 1.35 million hybrids as of June 2014[update];  As of January 2017[update], worldwide hybrid sales are led by the Toyota Prius liftback, with cumulative sales of almost 4 million units.

  "/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle": "A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or, more commonly, by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy.\n As of 2019[update], there are three models of hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai, the Hyundai Nexo, and the Honda Clarity. Several other companies are working to develop hydrogen cars.\n As of 2019, 98% of hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming, which emits carbon dioxide. It can be produced by thermochemical or pyrolytic means using renewable feedstocks, but that is an expensive process. Various technologies are being developed that aim to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas. The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high carbon emissions intensity when produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, low energy content per unit volume at ambient conditions, production and compression of hydrogen, the investment required in filling stations to dispense hydrogen, transportation of hydrogen to filling stations and lack of ability to produce or dispense hydrogen at home.",
  "/wiki/Fuel_cell_car": "A fuel cell vehicle (FCV) or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is a type of electric vehicle which uses a fuel cell, instead of a battery, or in combination with a battery or supercapacitor, to power its on-board electric motor. Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity to power the motor, generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen.  Most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat. As compared with internal combustion vehicles, hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production, where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas.  Transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants.\n Fuel cells have been used in various kinds of vehicles including forklifts, especially in indoor applications where their clean emissions are important to air quality, and in space applications. The first commercially produced hydrogen fuel cell automobile, the Hyundai Tucson FCEV, was introduced in 2013, Toyota Mirai followed in 2015 and then Honda entered the market. Fuel cells are being developed and tested in trucks, buses, boats, motorcycles and bicycles, among other kinds of vehicles.\n As of 2017, there was limited hydrogen infrastructure, with 36 hydrogen fueling stations for automobiles publicly available in the U.S., but more hydrogen stations are planned, particularly in California, where, as of 2019, according to Hydrogen View, there have been over 7,500 FCEVs sold or leased. Critics doubt whether hydrogen will be efficient or cost-effective for automobiles, as compared with other zero emission technologies, and in 2019, USA Today stated \"what is tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market.\"",

  "/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid": "A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery can be recharged by plugging it into an external source of electric power, as well as by its on-board engine and generator. Most PHEVs are passenger cars, but there are also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles.\n Similarly to all-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids displace emissions from the car tailpipe to the generators powering the electricity grid. These generators may be renewable, or may have lower emission than an internal combustion engine. Charging the battery from the grid can cost less than using the on-board engine, helping to reduce operating cost.\n Mass-produced plug-in hybrids were available to the public in China and the United States in 2010.

Specific types of microcars include bubble cars, cycle cars, quadricycles and voiturettes, and the Japanese equivalent is the kei car.\n Microcars are often covered by separate regulations to normal cars, having relaxed requirements for registration and licensing. Most microcars are powered by petrol or diesel engines, however electric-powered microcars have become more common in recent years.",
  "/wiki/Isetta": "The Isetta is an Italian-designed microcar built under license in a number of different countries, including Argentina, Spain, Belgium, France, Brazil, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Because of its egg shape and bubble-like windows, it became known as a bubble car, a name also given to other similar vehicles.\n In 1955, the BMW Isetta became the world's first mass-production car to achieve a fuel consumption of 3 L/100 km (94 mpg\u2011imp; 78 mpg\u2011US).[a] It was the top-selling single-cylinder car in the world, with 161,728 units sold.\n Initially manufactured by the Italian firm Iso SpA, the name Isetta is the Italian diminutive form of Iso, meaning \"little Iso\".",

  "/wiki/Pony_car": "Pony car is an American car classification for affordable, compact, highly styled coup\u00e9s or convertibles with a \"sporty\" or performance-oriented image. Common characteristics include rear-wheel drive, a long hood, a short decklid, a wide range of options to individualize each car and use of mass-produced parts shared with other models.\n The popularity of pony cars is largely due to the launch of the Ford Mustang in 1964. Currently produced pony cars are the Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger.",
  "/wiki/Ford_Mustang": "The Ford Mustang is an American car manufactured by Ford.  It was originally conceived by Lee Iacocca.  The Mustang debuted in 1964 with a price of $2,368, with estimated annual sales of 100,000.   First year sales were over 400,000 units and one million within two years.\n The Mustang created the \"pony car\" class of American muscle cars, distinguished as affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks, and gave rise to competitors such as the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin, Chrysler's revamped Plymouth Barracuda, and the second generation Dodge Challenger. The Mustang is also credited for inspiring the designs of coup\u00e9s such as the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri, which were imported to the United States.\n It was originally based on the platform of the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a \"1964\u00bd\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A. The Mustang has undergone several transformations to its current sixth generation.\n The Ford Mustang began production five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates in August 1964 at the formal start of the 1965 production year contribute to tracking 1964\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). with production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan, on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.\n The Mustang is the only original model to remain in uninterrupted production over five decades of development and revision.\nAs of August 2018[update], over 10 million Mustangs have been produced in the U.S.",
  "/wiki/Nissan_Z-car": "The Nissan Z-car is a sports car which has been manufactured by Nissan Motors Ltd, in six generations, since 1969.\n The original Z was sold from October 1969 in Japan, as the Nissan Fairlady Z, at Nissan Exhibition dealerships that previously sold the Nissan Bluebird. It was exported as the Datsun 240Z. Since 2009, Nissan has manufactured the newest Z, the Nissan 370Z.\n The earlier models of the Nissan Z were built at the Nissan Shatai plant in Hiratsuka until 2000, while the later models (350Z and 370Z) are built at Oppama (2002\u20132004) and Tochigi (2004\u2013present). Enthusiasts praise the cars for their looks, reliability, performance, and affordability.

  "/wiki/Convertible": "A convertible, cabriolet or spyder/spider  (/\u02cck\u00e6brio\u028a\u02c8le\u026a/) is a passenger car that can be driven with or without a roof in place. The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary between models.\nA convertible allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. Potential drawbacks of convertibles are reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car's roof) and cargo space.\n The majority of convertible roofs are a folding construction made from cloth. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk).",
  "/wiki/Mazda_MX-5": "The Mazda MX-5 is a lightweight two-passenger roadster manufactured and marketed by Mazda with a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The convertible is marketed as the Mazda Roadster (\u30de\u30c4\u30c0\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc, Matsuda R\u014ddosut\u0101) or Eunos Roadster (\u30e6\u30fc\u30ce\u30b9\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc, Y\u016bnosu R\u014ddosut\u0101) in Japan, and as the Mazda MX-5 Miata (/mi\u02c8\u0251\u02d0t\u0259/) in North America, where it is widely known as the Miata.\n Manufactured at Mazda's Hiroshima plant, the MX-5 debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show and was conceived and executed under a tightly focused design credo, Jinba ittai (\u4eba\u99ac\u4e00\u4f53), meaning \"oneness of horse and rider\". Widely noted for its small, light, technologically modern, dynamically balanced and minimally complex design, the MX-5 is the spiritual successor to 1950s and '60s Italian and British sports cars, prominently the Lotus Elan.\n Generations were internally designated with a two-letter code, beginning with the first generation, the NA. The second generation, (NB), launched in 1998 for MY 1999; followed by the third generation (NC) in 2005 for MY 2006, and the fourth generation (ND) in 2015 for MY 2016 (along with \"ND2\" being the designation for MY 2019). \n As the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in history, the MX-5 has been marketed globally, with production exceeding one million, as of early 2016. The name miata derives from Old High German for \"reward\".[N 1]",
  "/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2": "The Volkswagen Type 2, known officially (depending on body type) as the Transporter, Kombi or Microbus, or, informally, as the Bus (US) or Camper (UK), P\u00e3o de Forma (Loaf of Bread) (Portugal) is a forward control light commercial vehicle introduced in 1950 by the German automaker Volkswagen as its second car model. Following \u2013 and initially deriving from \u2013 Volkswagen's first model, the Type 1 (Beetle), it was given the factory designation Type 2.\n As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans, the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s, including the Ford Econoline, the Dodge A100, and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan, the latter adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1 layout.\n European competition included the 1947\u20131981 Citro\u00ebn H Van, the 1959\u20131980 Renault Estafette (both FF layout), and the 1953\u20131965 FR layout Ford Transit.\n Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles, such as the Nissan Caravan, Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar.\n Like the Beetle, the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide, including the \"microbus\", \"minibus\", and, because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s, \"Hippie van/bus\" has become its most popular.\n Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T2 series of Type 2, which ceased production on 31 December 2013, due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country. This (after the 2002 termination of its T3 successor in South Africa) marked the end of the era of rear-engine Volkswagens, which originated in 1935 with their Type 1 prototypes.",
  "/wiki/List_of_best-selling_automobiles": "Best selling automobiles are those passenger cars and light trucks which, since the introduction of the Benz Patent Motorwagen in 1886, can lay claim to being the highest selling vehicles in the markets they compete in.\n While references to verify the manufacturers' claims have been included, there is always the possibility of inaccuracy or hyperbole. Also note that a single vehicle can be sold concurrently under several nameplates in different markets, as with for example the Nissan Sunny; in such circumstances manufacturers often provide only cumulative units sold figures for all models. As a result, there is no definitive standard for measuring units sold; \nChrysler minivans has sold over 16 million worldwide. Volkswagen has claimed its Beetle as the bestselling car in history as it did not substantially change throughout its production run. By contrast, Toyota has applied the Corolla nameplate to 13 generations since 1966, which have sold over 44 million through 2016."
