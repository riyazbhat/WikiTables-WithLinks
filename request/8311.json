  "/wiki/Pycard": "Pycard, also spelt Picard and Picart (late 14th century \u2013 early 15th century) was an English or French Medieval and Renaissance transitional composer.\n He may have served in John of Gaunt's household in the 1390s as 'Jehan Pycard alias Vaux'. The name \"Picard\" suggests a French origin, but his music is regarded as being in an English tradition. He is one of the most prolific composers represented in the Old Hall Manuscript (British Library: Additional 57950), with nine works from it attributed to him. His music is in the ars nova style, and is unusual in its virtuosity.",
  "/wiki/Leonel_Power": "Leonel Power (also spelled Lionel, Lyonel, Leonellus, Leonelle; Polbero; 1370 to 1385 \u2013 5 June 1445) was an English composer of the late Medieval and early Renaissance eras.  Along with John Dunstaple, he was one of the major figures in English music in the early 15th century.",
  "/wiki/Roy_Henry": "Roy Henry (\"King\" Henry) (fl. around 1410) was an English composer, almost certainly a king of England: probably Henry V, but also possibly Henry IV.  His music, two compositions in all, appears in a position of prominence in the Old Hall Manuscript.\n Musicologists have not been able to agree on which English monarch wrote the two mass movements which appear, at the head of their respective sections, in the Old Hall Manuscript.  Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, was in his early forties when the music was most likely written, since stylistic evidence places it around 1410. However, by 1410 Henry IV was suffering from a disfiguring disease and struggling to maintain his regal power. Therefore, it is unlikely that he, albeit a talented musician, could be the composer of the two pieces. Whereas Henry V, despite being extremely 'busy on campaigns' after his succession, was recorded to never have ceased in his fondness for music. In 1420 the Pell Rolls recorded payments for two new harps to be shipped to the King in France. And the King even went so far as to take his chapel to the Agincourt campaign. This, as well as being substantial evidence for his piety, suggests that the latter is the composer.\n Henry V, who reigned from 1413 to 1422, was known to have cultivated music in his youth. Payment for a harp along with 'swords and books on Latin verses' for the young lord Henry was recorded when he was merely six years old.  An early biography of Henry V states:\n \u2026he was in his youth a diligent follower of idle practices, much given to instruments of music, and fired with the torches of Venus herself.\nRecent research has shown that work on the Old Hall Manuscript probably ceased on the death of Thomas, Duke of Clarence, in 1421. And the last piece of music in the Manuscript was doubtlessly written for the wedding of Henry and Catherine.  Since Thomas was King Henry V's brother, and his chapel's musicians are now known to have included Leonel Power, and the manuscript itself passed to Henry V's chapel on the death of Thomas, and the composers included some members of the King's Royal Chapel, most notably John Dunstable. Obviously the manuscript could not have been passed to the long-dead Henry IV at this time, yet this is not a conclusive argument. But it is worth noting that Henry V's extraordinary piety - outdoing even his father in matters of religion - is consistent with the composition of sacred music, and we can be sure of his musical education. It is impossible to say for certain which man was the composer without further evidence.\n Roy Henry's music consists of two movements of the ordinary of the mass:  a Gloria and a Sanctus, both for three voices, and written in a fairly low register.  The music itself is skillfully written, and unusually for the time, no specific plainchant can be identified as a source; both pieces may be freely composed, or the underlying chant may be part of the enormous lost repertory of music from the early 15th century, hence unidentifiable (the vast majority of manuscripts of the time were destroyed in the 1530s during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries).",
  "/wiki/Byttering": "Byttering (also Bytering, Bytteryng, or Biteryng; possible first name Thomas) (fl. c. 1400 \u2013 1420) was an English composer during the transitional period from Medieval to Renaissance styles.  Five of his compositions have survived, all of them in the Old Hall Manuscript.\n A possible identification of Byttering with a Thomas Byteryng has been made. Byteryng was a canon at Hastings Castle between 1405 and 1408, and was a rector somewhere in London in 1414. There is no information on the composer in the Old Hall Manuscript other than that his surname is attached to several pieces. Those pieces stand out from many of the works in the manuscript by their relatively advanced stylistic traits.\n Byttering's music includes three mass sections \u2013 two Glorias and a Credo \u2013 a motet based on Nesciens Mater, and a substantial three-voice, isorhythmic wedding motet, En Katerine solennia/Virginalis contio/Sponsus amat sponsum, his best-known work, which was almost certainly written for the wedding, on 2 June 1420, of King Henry V and Catherine of Valois.\n The four-voice Gloria, No. 18 in the Old Hall MS, is one of the most complex canons of the early 15th century, and represents what was probably the extreme of stylistic differentiation between English and continental practice.  Canons in continental sources are extremely rare, but there are seven in the Old Hall MS, and Byttering's is the only one with the standard arrangement of the same tune in all four voices.",
  "/wiki/John_Dunstaple": "John Dunstaple (or Dunstable, c. 1390 \u2013 24 December 1453) was an English composer of polyphonic music of the late medieval era and early Renaissance periods. He was one of the most famous composers active in the early 15th century, a near-contemporary of Leonel Power, and was widely influential, not only in England but on the continent, especially in the developing style of the Burgundian School.\n The spelling \"Dunstaple\" is preferred by Margaret Bent, since it occurs in more than twice as many musical attributions as that of \"Dunstable\". The few English musical sources are equally divided between \"b\" and \"p\"; however, the contemporary non-musical sources, including those with a claim to a direct association with the composer, spell his name with a \"p.\" Both spellings remain in common usage.",
  "/wiki/John_Plummer_(composer)": "John Plummer (also Plomer, Plourmel, Plumere, Polmier, Polumier; c. 1410 \u2013 c. 1483) was an English composer who flourished during the reign of Henry VI of England.\n Not many of Plummer's compositions survive. The motets Anna mater matris Christi (Anne, mother of the mother of Christ) and Tota Pulchra Es (My Love is Wholly Beautiful) are widely available and recorded.  A number of Plummer's compositions appear in the manuscript Brussels Bilioth\u00e8que Royale MS 5557.  During his own lifetime, knowledge and performance of his works spread at least as far as the present-day Czech Republic, where pieces such as Tota Pulchra Es were copied into the Codex Speci\u00e1ln\u00edk (c. 1500).  These pieces are unaccompanied sacred vocal music written for use in the great royal and noble chapels of northern Europe.\n Plummer was a member of the English Chapel Royal at least from 1438, and was also apparently the first to hold the office of Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1444 to 1455. He left the royal household towards the end of his career and moved to St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor, where he was a verger. This post is likely to have supported him in his declining years.",

  "/wiki/William_Horwood_(composer)": "William Horwood, also Horewud, was an English polyphonic vocal composer in the late-medieval period (c. 1430 \u2013 1484). In 1470, he was a singer at Lincoln Cathedral, in 1476, he was a vicar choral at Lincoln, and from 1477 until 1484, he was the Cathedral choirmaster. He has three complete pieces and one incomplete piece in the Eton Choirbook, and one incomplete piece in a York manuscript.\n Horwood's \"Magnificat secundi toni a 5\" bears a strong resemblance to compositions of his near contemporary Josquin des Prez (c. 1440\u20131521), so much so that he might easily be mistaken for Josquin upon first audition. No mention is made of Horwood among the listing of Josquin's contemporaries in Grout; neither is the Eton Choirbook mentioned in Grout.\n A very scanty on-line article \u2013 only a thumbnail description of the composer \u2013 is present on (FM 99.5, New York) WBAI producer Chris Whent's Here of a Sunday Morning site.

  "/wiki/William_Hawte": "Sir William Hawte (also Haute or Haut) (c. 1430- 2 Jul 1497) was a prominent member of a Kentish gentry family of long standing in royal service, which, through its near connections to the Woodville family, became closely and dangerously embroiled in the last phases of the Wars of the Roses.\n It is claimed that he is the same Sir William Hawte who was a composer of liturgical and devotional choral music (who flourished c. 1460\u20131470), represented in a number of manuscript choirbooks that survive to this day. Two settings of the Benedicamus Domino are found in the Pepys Manuscript, and another work attributed to him, a Stella coeli, extirpavit (a Latin prayer to the Virgin, for protection from plague) exists in the Ritson Manuscript.",

While only two compositions of this late 15th-century composer have survived, one of them, a five-voice setting of the Salve Regina Marian antiphon, has attracted interest from musicologists because of its close relationship to music being written at the same time on the continent, as well as its high level of workmanship.",
  "/wiki/Gilbert_Banester": "Gilbert Banester (c. 1445 \u2013 1487) was an English composer and poet of Flemish influences.\n Possibly a native of London, he was Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1478 to 1490. His works are found in a number of Tudor manuscript collections of church music, including the Pepys Manuscript; there is also an antiphon by his hand in the Eton Choirbook. Stylistically the work is similar to those of William Horwood in the same book, but is unusual in that it is written to a prose text. Two poems have been ascribed to Banester, the Miracle of St Thomas of 1467 and a translation of Boccaccio, dating to 1450, that is the first known in the English language.\n Little else is known of Banester's life. He was recorded as the \"king's servant\" in 1471. In addition, it is known that Edward IV provided him with corrodies for two Abbeys, and he was made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1475. In 1478 he became master of the choristers. He died in 1487.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Renaissance_composers": "This is a list of composers active during the Renaissance period of European history. Since the 14th century is not usually considered by music historians to be part of the musical Renaissance, but part of the Middle Ages, composers active during that time can be found in the List of Medieval composers. Composers on this list had some period of significant activity after 1400, before 1600, or in a few cases they wrote music in a Renaissance idiom in the several decades after 1600."
