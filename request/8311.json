  "/wiki/Pycard": "Pycard, also spelt Picard and Picart (late 14th century - early 15th century) was an English or French Medieval and Renaissance transitional composer. He may have served in John of Gaunt's household in the 1390s as 'Jehan Pycard alias Vaux'. The name Picard suggests a French origin, but his music is regarded as being in an English tradition. He is one of the most prolific composers represented in the Old Hall Manuscript (British Library: Additional 57950), with nine works from it attributed to him. His music is in the ars nova style, and is unusual in its virtuosity.",
  "/wiki/Leonel_Power": "Leonel Power (also spelled Lionel, Lyonel, Leonellus, Leonelle; Polbero; 1370 to 1385 - 5 June 1445) was an English composer of the late Medieval and early Renaissance eras. Along with John Dunstaple, he was one of the major figures in English music in the early 15th century.",
  "/wiki/Roy_Henry": "Roy Henry (King Henry) (fl. around 1410) was an English composer, almost certainly a king of England: probably Henry V, but also possibly Henry IV. His music, two compositions in all, appears in a position of prominence in the Old Hall Manuscript. Musicologists have not been able to agree on which English monarch wrote the two mass movements which appear, at the head of their respective sections, in the Old Hall Manuscript. Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, was in his early forties when the music was most likely written, since stylistic evidence places it around 1410. However, by 1410 Henry IV was suffering from a disfiguring disease and struggling to maintain his regal power. Therefore, it is unlikely that he, albeit a talented musician, could be the composer of the two pieces. Whereas Henry V, despite being extremely 'busy on campaigns' after his succession, was recorded to never have ceased in his fondness for music. In 1420 the Pell Rolls recorded payments for two new harps to be shipped to the King in France. And the King even went so far as to take his chapel to the Agincourt campaign. This, as well as being substantial evidence for his piety, suggests that the latter is the composer. Henry V, who reigned from 1413 to 1422, was known to have cultivated music in his youth.",
  "/wiki/Byttering": "Byttering (also Bytering, Bytteryng, or Biteryng; possible first name Thomas) (fl. c. 1400 - 1420) was an English composer during the transitional period from Medieval to Renaissance styles. Five of his compositions have survived, all of them in the Old Hall Manuscript. A possible identification of Byttering with a Thomas Byteryng has been made. Byteryng was a canon at Hastings Castle between 1405 and 1408, and was a rector somewhere in London in 1414. There is no information on the composer in the Old Hall Manuscript other than that his surname is attached to several pieces. Those pieces stand out from many of the works in the manuscript by their relatively advanced stylistic traits. Byttering's music includes three mass sections - two Glorias and a Credo - a motet based on Nesciens Mater, and a substantial three-voice, isorhythmic wedding motet, En Katerine solennia/Virginalis contio/Sponsus amat sponsum, his best-known work, which was almost certainly written for the wedding, on 2 June 1420, of King Henry V and Catherine of Valois. The four-voice Gloria, No. 18 in the Old Hall MS, is one of the most complex canons of the early 15th century, and represents what was probably the extreme of stylistic differentiation between English and continental practice. Canons in continental sources are extremely rare, but there are seven in the Old Hall MS, and Byttering's is the only one with the standard arrangement of the same tune in all four voices.",
  "/wiki/John_Dunstaple": "John Dunstaple (or Dunstable, c. 1390 - 24 December 1453) was an English composer of polyphonic music of the late medieval era and early Renaissance periods. He was one of the most famous composers active in the early 15th century, a near-contemporary of Leonel Power, and was widely influential, not only in England but on the continent, especially in the developing style of the Burgundian School. The spelling Dunstaple is preferred by Margaret Bent, since it occurs in more than twice as many musical attributions as that of Dunstable. The few English musical sources are equally divided between b and p; however, the contemporary non-musical sources, including those with a claim to a direct association with the composer, spell his name with a p. Both spellings remain in common usage.",
  "/wiki/John_Plummer_(composer)": "John Plummer (also Plomer, Plourmel, Plumere, Polmier, Polumier; c. 1410 - c. 1483) was an English composer who flourished during the reign of Henry VI of England. Not many of Plummer's compositions survive. The motets Anna mater matris Christi (Anne, mother of the mother of Christ) and Tota Pulchra Es (My Love is Wholly Beautiful) are widely available and recorded. A number of Plummer's compositions appear in the manuscript Brussels Bilioth\u00e8que Royale MS 5557. During his own lifetime, knowledge and performance of his works spread at least as far as the present-day Czech Republic, where pieces such as Tota Pulchra Es were copied into the Codex Speci\u00e1ln\u00edk (c. 1500). These pieces are unaccompanied sacred vocal music written for use in the great royal and noble chapels of northern Europe. Plummer was a member of the English Chapel Royal at least from 1438, and was also apparently the first to hold the office of Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1444 to 1455. He left the royal household towards the end of his career and moved to St Georges Chapel, Windsor, where he was a verger. This post is likely to have supported him in his declining years.",
  "/wiki/Henry_Abyngdon": "Henry Abyngdon, Abingdon or Abington (ca. 1418 - 1 September 1497) was an English ecclesiastic and musician, perhaps the first to receive a university degree in music.",
  "/wiki/Walter_Frye": "Walter Frye (died 1474?) was an English composer of the early Renaissance.",
  "/wiki/William_Horwood_(composer)": "William Horwood, also Horewud, was an English polyphonic vocal composer in the late-medieval period (c. 1430 - 1484). In 1470, he was a singer at Lincoln Cathedral, in 1476, he was a vicar choral at Lincoln, and from 1477 until 1484, he was the Cathedral choirmaster. He has three complete pieces and one incomplete piece in the Eton Choirbook, and one incomplete piece in a York manuscript. Horwood's Magnificat secundi toni a 5 bears a strong resemblance to compositions of his near contemporary Josquin des Prez (c. 1440-1521), so much so that he might easily be mistaken for Josquin upon first audition. No mention is made of Horwood among the listing of Josquin's contemporaries in Grout; neither is the Eton Choirbook mentioned in Grout. A very scanty on-line article - only a thumbnail description of the composer - is present on (FM 99.5, New York) WBAI producer Chris Whent's Here of a Sunday Morning site. (The link Partial William Horwood Discography has no content.) Virtually no other information is available on the internet.",
  "/wiki/John_Hothby": "John Hothby (Otteby, Hocby, Octobi, Ottobi, c. 1410-1487), also known by his Latinised names Johannes Ottobi or Johannes de Londonis, was an English Renaissance composer and musical theorist who travelled widely in Europe and gained an international reputation for his work.",
  "/wiki/William_Hawte": "Sir William Hawte (also Haute or Haut) (c. 1430- 2 Jul 1497) was a prominent member of a Kentish gentry family of long standing in royal service, which, through its near connections to the Woodville family, became closely and dangerously embroiled in the last phases of the Wars of the Roses. It is claimed that he is the same Sir William Hawte who was a composer of liturgical and devotional choral music (who flourished c. 1460-1470), represented in a number of manuscript choirbooks that survive to this day. Two settings of the Benedicamus Domino are found in the Pepys Manuscript, and another work attributed to him, a Stella coeli, extirpavit (a Latin prayer to the Virgin, for protection from plague) exists in the Ritson Manuscript.",
  "/wiki/Richard_Hygons": "Richard Hygons (also Higons, Huchons, Hugo; c. 1435 - c. 1509) was an English composer of the early Renaissance. While only two compositions of this late 15th-century composer have survived, one of them, a five-voice setting of the Salve Regina Marian antiphon, has attracted interest from musicologists because of its close relationship to music being written at the same time on the continent, as well as its high level of workmanship.",
  "/wiki/Gilbert_Banester": "Gilbert Banester (c. 1445 - 1487) was an English composer and poet of Flemish influences. Possibly a native of London, he was Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1478 to 1490. His works are found in a number of Tudor manuscript collections of church music, including the Pepys Manuscript; there is also an antiphon by his hand in the Eton Choirbook. Stylistically the work is similar to those of William Horwood in the same book, but is unusual in that it is written to a prose text. Two poems have been ascribed to Banester, the Miracle of St Thomas of 1467 and a translation of Boccaccio, dating to 1450, that is the first known in the English language. Little else is known of Banester's life. He was recorded as the king's servant in 1471. In addition, it is known that Edward IV provided him with corrodies for two Abbeys, and he was made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1475. In 1478 he became master of the choristers. He died in 1487.",
  "/wiki/Walter_Lambe": "Walter Lambe (1450-1? - after Michaelmas 1504) was an English composer. His works are well represented in Eton Choirbook. Also Lambeth and Caius Choirbook include his works. Born in Salisbury, elected King's Scholar at Eton College in August 1467 aged 15. [a] By 1477 Lambe was a clerk at Holy Trinity College, Arundel[b] and in 1479 he moved to St George's Chapel, Windsor as a clerk of the choir there.",
  "/wiki/Hugh_Kellyk": "Hugh Kellyk (fl.c.1480) was an English composer, whose two surviving works are preserved in the Eton Choirbook. These two works are a five-part Magnificat and a seven-part Gaude flore virginali, which appear to be among the earlier pieces in the choirbook. Gaude Flore Virginali was recorded by The Sixteen in 1994, the Magnificat by Tonus Peregrinus.",
  "/wiki/Edmund_Turges": "Edmund Turges (c. 1450-1500) thought to be also Edmund Sturges (fl. 1507-1508) was an English Renaissance era composer who came from Petworth, was ordained by Bishop Ridley in 1550, and joined the Fraternity of St. Nicholas (the London Guild of Parish Clerks) in 1522. Several works are listed in the name of Turges in the Eton Choirbook, which survived Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541. Turges also has a Magnificat extant in the Caius Choirbook, and compositions in the Fayrfax Boke. A Kyrie and Gloria are ascribed to Sturges in the Ritson Manuscript. At least two masses and three Magnificat settings have been lost, as well as eight six-part pieces listed in the 1529 King's College Inventory."
