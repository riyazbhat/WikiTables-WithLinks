He joined the Nazi Party in 1928 and was elected to the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic in 1930. Prior to 1929, Dietrich was Adolf Hitler's chauffeur and bodyguard. He received rapid promotions in the SS after his participation in the extrajudicial executions of political opponents during the 1934 purge known as the Night of the Long Knives. Despite having no formal staff officer training, Dietrich was, along with Paul Hausser, the highest-ranking officer in the Waffen-SS, the paramilitary branch of the SS. Reaching the rank of Oberst-Gruppenf\u00fchrer, he commanded units up to army level during World War II. As commanding officer of the 6th Panzer Army during the Battle of the Bulge, Dietrich bore responsibility for the Malmedy massacre, the murder of U.S. prisoners of war in December 1944. After the war, Dietrich was convicted of war crimes at the Malmedy massacre trial, conducted by the U.S. military tribunal, and later in West Germany for his involvement in the 1934 purge.",

KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat, but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes, murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism. KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval, air and support troops. Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 (dagger) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events.

The SS used the rank of Sturmhauptf\u00fchrer from 1930 to 1934 at which time, following the Night of the Long Knives, the name of the rank was changed to Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer although the insignia remained the same. Sturmhauptf\u00fchrer remained an SA rank until 1945. Some of the most infamous SS members are known to have held the rank of Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer. Among them are Josef Mengele, the infamous doctor assigned to Auschwitz; Klaus Barbie, Gestapo Chief of Lyon; Joseph Kramer, commandant of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp; Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann's assistant; and Amon G\u00f6th, who was sentenced to death and hanged for committing multiple waves of mass murder (liquidations of the ghettos at Tarn\u00f3w and Krak\u00f3w, the camp at Szebnie, the Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp, as portrayed in the film Schindler's List). The insignia of Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer was three silver pips and two silver stripes on a black collar patch, worn opposite a unit insignia patch.",

  "/wiki/Hans_Dorr": "The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of the Nazi Germany during World War II. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. [Note 1] This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the Order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of Nazi Germany. These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 \u2014 Die Inhaber der h\u00f6chsten Auszeichnung des Zweiten Weltkrieges aller Wehrmachtteile \u2014 The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945 \u2014 The Owners of the Highest Award of the Second World War of all Wehrmacht Branches. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Knight's_Cross_of_the_Iron_Cross_with_Oak_Leaves,_Swords_or_Diamonds_recipients_of_the_Waffen-SS": "The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its variants were the highest award in the military of the Third Reich. During or shortly after World War II, 457 German servicemen of the Waffen-SS, including volunteers from Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands and Norway, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 411 presentations were formally made and evidence of the award is still available in the German Federal Archives. One recipient, Hermann Fegelein, was court-martialed and executed on 29 April 1945. According to German law he was deprived of rank and all awards previously. Fegelein must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient. A further 46 Knight's Cross, nine Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and four Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords recipients are either lacking the evidence to sustain their listings or received the award under questionable legal terms. However, all of them were accepted by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger des Eisernen Kreuzes e.V.)"
