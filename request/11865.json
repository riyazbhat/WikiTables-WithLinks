  "/wiki/\u010cern\u00e9_jezero": "\u010cern\u00e9 jezero in the Bohemian Forest is the largest and deepest natural lake in the Czech Republic.\n This triangular lake surrounded with spruce forest is located about 6 km northwest of \u017delezn\u00e1 Ruda under a 300-metre-high cliff on Jezern\u00ed hora (1,343 m). It is of glacial origin, a product of the W\u00fcrm glaciation. The water in the lake is oligotrophic. There is a natural outflow through \u010cern\u00fd potok, a short stream which is a tributary of the \u00dahlava River. The main European water divide runs across the mountain just above the lake. As a consequence, \u010cern\u00e9 jezero belongs to the water basin of the Elbe, which finds the North Sea, while \u010certovo jezero just 2 km away drains into the Danube and thence the Black Sea.\n The oldest pumped-storage hydroelectric plant in the Czech Republic (built 1929-1930) is located here; the lake serves as its upper reservoir.",

  "/wiki/B\u00edlina_River": "The B\u00edlina (Czech pronunciation: [\u02c8bi\u02d0l\u026ana]; German: Biela) rises on the slopes of the Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic, north of Chomutov. The river flows between the Czech Central Mountains and the Ore Mountains to the north-east, and empties into the Elbe in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem.\n The catchment area of the river covers an area of 1,082 km\u00b2, and its total length is 82.0 km. In the upper part it flows through a man-made riverbed which was created when lignite mining in the area around Most started. At the same time, the former Lake Komo\u0159any was drained.\n A substantial part of the flow was extracted for use in chemical plants in Z\u00e1lu\u017e\u00ed u Litv\u00ednova. The highly polluted output killed all fish. The situation improved significantly during the 1990s. The flow rate is currently artificially increased by redirection of water from the catchment area of the Oh\u0159e. However, the B\u00edlina is still one of the most polluted rivers in the Czech Republic.\n For most of the river's length it flows through open, treeless countryside. The river bed is 5 to 10 metres wide, mostly regulated. The river has no major tributaries. Towns located on the river include Jirkov, Most, B\u00edlina and \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem.",
