He was an important organizer of the Hungarian Communists' power (for example, organizing the State Protection Authority (\u00c1VH)), but he eventually fell victim to M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi's show trials.",
  "/wiki/Hungarian_Working_People's_Party": "The Hungarian Working People's Party (Hungarian: Magyar Dolgoz\u00f3k P\u00e1rtja, MDP) was the ruling communist party of Hungary from 1948 to 1956. It was formed by a merger of the Hungarian Communist Party (MKP) and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party.  Ostensibly a union of equals, the merger had actually occurred as a result of massive pressure brought to bear on the Social Democrats by both the Hungarian Communists, as well as the Soviet Union.  The few independent-minded Social Democrats who had not been sidelined by Communist salami tactics were pushed out in short order after the merger, leaving the party as essentially the MKP under a new name.\n Its leader was M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi until 1956, then Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 in the same year for three months, and eventually J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r until the party's dissolution. Other minor legal Hungarian political parties were allowed to continue as independent coalition parties until late 1949, but were completely subservient to the MDP.\n During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the party was reorganised into the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) by a circle of communists around K\u00e1d\u00e1r and Imre Nagy.  The new government of Nagy declared to assess the uprising not as counter-revolutionary but as a \"great, national and democratic event\" and to dissolve State Security Police (\u00c1VH). Hungary's declaration to become neutral and to exit the Warsaw Pact, caused the second Soviet intervention on 4 November 1956.\nAfter 8 November 1956, the MSZMP, under K\u00e1d\u00e1r's leadership, fully supported the Soviet Union.",

An ardent Stalinist, his government was very loyal to the Soviet Union, and he presided over the mass imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian people and the deaths of thousands.",
  "/wiki/Joseph_Stalin": "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[b] (born Ioseb Besarionis dz\u0435 Jughashvili;[a] 18 December\u00a0[O.S. 6 December]\u00a01878 \u2013 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician who led the Soviet Union from the mid\u20131920s until 1953 as the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131952) and premier of the Soviet Union (1941\u20131953). Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become the country's de facto dictator by the 1930s. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism\u2013Leninism, while his own policies are known as Stalinism.\n Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution and created a one-party state under Lenin's newly renamed Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death. Under Stalin, \"Socialism in One Country\" became a central tenet of the party's dogma. Through the Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. This led to significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the famine of 1932\u201333. To eradicate accused \"enemies of the working class\", Stalin instituted the \"Great Purge\", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had complete personal control over the party and state.\n Stalin's government promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, it signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German incursion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The Soviets annexed the Baltic states and helped establish Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as global superpowers. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc which became known as the Cold War. Stalin led his country through the post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon in 1949. In these years, the country experienced another major famine and an anti-semitic campaign peaking in the doctors' plot. After Stalin's death in 1953 he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced his predecessor and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society.\n Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his totalitarian government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, deportations, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines which killed millions.",

His 32-year term as General Secretary covered most of the period the People's Republic of Hungary existed. Due to K\u00e1d\u00e1r's age, declining health and declining political mastery, he retired as General Secretary of the party in 1988 and a younger generation consisting mostly of reformers took over.\n K\u00e1d\u00e1r was born in Fiume to a poor family. He never met his father, who left his mother when he was young. After living in the countryside for some years, K\u00e1d\u00e1r and his mother moved to Budapest. After quitting school, K\u00e1d\u00e1r joined the Communist Party of Hungary's youth organisation, KIMSZ. K\u00e1d\u00e1r would go on to become a prominent figure in the pre-World War II communist party, even becoming First Secretary. As leader, he dissolved the party and reorganised it as the Peace Party. This new party failed to win any popular support for the communist cause and he would later be accused of dissolving the Hungarian communist party. With the German invasion of Hungary, the Peace Party tried again to win support from the Hungarian populace, but failed. At the time of the Soviet occupation, the communist movement led by K\u00e1d\u00e1r was small.\n As the Communists took over Hungary in 1947\u201348, K\u00e1d\u00e1r rose quickly through the Party ranks, serving as Interior Minister from 1948 to 1950. He took part in the trial and interrogation of former secret police chief L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk, one of the most infamous show-trials in the post-war Eastern bloc. In 1951, he was imprisoned by the Stalinist regime of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi, but was released in 1954 by reformist Prime Minister Imre Nagy and became a rising star in the Party once again.  On 25 October 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution, K\u00e1d\u00e1r replaced Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 as General Secretary of the Party, taking part in Nagy's short-lived revolutionary government. However, on 1 November he broke with Nagy over the latter's decision to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact; secretly defecting to the Soviets. When the Soviets crushed the Revolution on 4 November, they selected K\u00e1d\u00e1r as the next leader of Hungary. After the Revolution was crushed, K\u00e1d\u00e1r initially presided over a reign of terror, ordering the execution of many participants in the Revolution (including Imre Nagy and his close associates) and the imprisonment of many others. However, he gradually softened his approach as the years passed, often granting individual amnesties, and moderating his regime's overall governing style. By 1963, the last prisoners from the Hungarian Revolution had been released.\n As leader of Hungary, K\u00e1d\u00e1r was a team player and took care to consult his colleagues before acting or making decisions and his tenure saw an attempt at liberalising the economic system to put greater effort to build up industries aimed at consumers. His rule was marked by what later became known as Goulash Communism. A significant increase in consumer expenditures because of the New Economic Mechanism (NEM), a major economic reform, reintroduced certain market mechanisms into Hungary. As a result of the relatively high standard of living, a favorable human rights policy and more relaxed travel restrictions than those present in other Eastern Bloc countries, Hungary was generally considered the best country to live in Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War, also expressed in the informal term \"the happiest barrack\". On 6 July 1989, an ill K\u00e1d\u00e1r died after having been forced to retire. K\u00e1d\u00e1r was succeeded by K\u00e1roly Gr\u00f3sz as General Secretary on 22 May 1988. Gr\u00f3sz would only serve a year in this post due to the fall of communism in Europe in 1989.\n While at the helm of the People's Republic of Hungary, K\u00e1d\u00e1r pushed for an improvement in the standard of living. K\u00e1d\u00e1r engaged in increased international trade with non-communist countries, in particular those of Western Europe. K\u00e1d\u00e1r's policies differed significantly from those of other communist leaders such as Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, Enver Hoxha and Wojciech Jaruzelski, all of whom favored authoritarian governments that suppressed and punished opposition severely. However, K\u00e1d\u00e1r's policies could not overcome the inherent limitations of the communist system and were viewed with distrust by the conservative leadership of Leonid Brezhnev in the Soviet Union. K\u00e1d\u00e1r's legacy remains disputed, but he was voted in a survey carried out by Median in Hungary in 2007 as the third most competent politician behind Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi and Lajos Kossuth who could solve the problems of Hungary.",
  "/wiki/General_Secretary": "Secretary is a title often used in organizations to indicate a person having a certain amount of authority, power, or importance in the organization. Secretaries announce important events and communicate to the organization. The term is derived from the Latin word secernere, \"to distinguish\" or \"to set apart\", the passive participle (secretum) meaning \"having been set apart\", with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential, as with the English word secret. A secretarius was a person, therefore, overseeing business confidentially, usually for a powerful individual (a king, pope, etc.).\n The official title of the leader of most communist and socialist political parties is the \"General Secretary of the Central Committee\" or \"First Secretary of the Central Committee\". When a communist party is in power, the General Secretary is usually the country's de facto leader (though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions to monopolize power, such as a presidency or premiership in order to constitute de jure leadership of the state), such as China and Cuba.\n In England, the term secretarius was used \"from the beginning of the thirteenth century in the varying meanings of a confidential clerk, an ambassador, or a member of the king's council\". In the fourteenth century, the title became strongly associated with the keeper of the king's signet. From the Renaissance to the late 19th century, men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful assumed the title of secretary. With time, like many titles, the term was applied to more and varied functions, leading to compound titles to specify the authority associated with its use, like general secretary or financial secretary.\n In some countries, such as the United States, the term secretary is used to indicate the holder of a cabinet-level post. There are a number of popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has a high degree of authority, such as general secretary (or, following usage in the Norman language, secretary-general), first secretary, and executive secretary.\n In a club or society, the secretary is also considered to be, in most cases, the third person in charge of the organization, after the president/chairman and vice president/vice chairman.  In smaller organizations, the secretary typically takes meeting minutes, notifies members of meetings, contacts various persons in relation to the society, administers the day-to-day activities of the organization, and creates the order of business. The secretary of a non-governmental organization or international non-governmental organization can combine the function with that of vice president/vice chairman.",

After the split between Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, the latter instigated a wave of \"purges\" of the respective Communist Party leaderships, to prevent more splits between the Soviet Union and its Central European \"satellite\" countries. In Czechoslovakia, Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd was one of 14 leaders arrested in 1951 and put on show trial en masse in November 1952, charged with high treason.

He married L\u00edda P\u00e1tkov\u00e1, the daughter of a branch director of the Czech Mortgage Bank in Bratislava, in March 1933. He became a Communist MP in 1935. Before the beginning of World War II, in 1938, he emigrated to Paris. His criticism of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in 1939, contradicted the policies of the Czechoslovak Communist Party exiled to Moscow and triggered an intra-party investigation overseen by Viliam \u0160irok\u00fd (who came to Paris from Moscow).\n At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, he was put into prison as a known Communist, and later evacuated to a British internment camp. After his release, he decided to spend the war in London, where he broadcast speeches on the radio calling for all Slovaks to fight against the Nazis. Returning in 1945, he became Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs under the first post-war government. As a representative of Czechoslovakia, he signed the UN Charter in San Francisco on 26 June 1945. After a coup d'\u00e9tat, which he helped organise, he succeeded Jan Masaryk as Foreign Minister. In 1948, in his new role, he played a decisive role in organising Czechoslovakia's part in Operation Balak by providing assistance to the newly founded Israeli Air Force. In 1950, he was forced to resign amid accusations of being a \"deviationist\".

  "/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union": "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)[b] was the founding and ruling political party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies modified Article 6 of the most recent 1977 Soviet constitution, which had granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system.\n The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks, a majority faction detached from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, who seized power in the October Revolution of 1917. After 74 years, it was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory, soon after a failed coup d'\u00e9tat by hard-line CPSU leaders against Soviet president and party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. It was completely outlawed three months later on 6 November 1991 on Russian territory.\n The CPSU was a Communist party, organized on the basis of democratic centralism. This principle, conceived by Lenin, entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The highest body within the CPSU was the Party Congress, which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo, (previously the Presidium), the Secretariat and the Orgburo (until 1952). The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary, Premier or head of state, or some of the three offices concurrently\u2014but never all three at the same time. The party leader was the de facto chairman of the CPSU Politburo and chief executive of the Soviet Union. The tension between the party and the state (Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union) for the shifting focus of power was never formally resolved, but in reality the party dominated and a paramount leader always existed (first Lenin and thereafter the General Secretary).\n After the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, Lenin had introduced a mixed economy, commonly referred to as the New Economic Policy, which allowed for capitalist practices to resume under the Communist Party dictation in order to develop the necessary conditions for socialism to become a practical pursuit in the economically undeveloped country. In 1929, as Joseph Stalin became the leader of the party, Marxism\u2013Leninism, a fusion of the original ideas of German philosopher and economic theorist Karl Marx, and Lenin, became formalized as the party's guiding ideology and would remain so throughout the rest of its existence. The party pursued state socialism, under which all industries were nationalized and a command economy was implemented. After recovering from the Second World War, reforms were implemented which decentralized economic planning and liberalized Soviet society in general under Nikita Khrushchev. By 1980, various factors, including the continuing Cold War, and ongoing nuclear arms race with the United States and other Western European powers and unaddressed inefficiencies in the economy, led to stagnant economic growth under Alexei Kosygin, and further with  Leonid Brezhnev and a growing disillusionment. After the younger, vigorous Mikhail Gorbachev (b. 1931), assumed leadership in 1985, (following two short-term elderly leaders who quickly died in succession), rapid steps were taken to transform the tottering Soviet economic system in the direction of a market economy once again. Gorbachev and his allies envisioned the introduction of an economy similar to Lenin's earlier New Economic Policy through a program of \"perestroika\", or restructuring, but their reforms, along with the institution of free multi-candidate elections led to a decline in the party's power, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the banning of the party by later last RSFSR President Boris Yeltsin and subsequent first President of an evolving democratic and free market economy of the successor Russian Federation.\n A number of causes contributed to CPSU's loss of control and the dissolution of the Soviet Union during the early 1990s. Some historians have written that Gorbachev's policy of \"glasnost\" (political openness) was the root cause, noting that it weakened the party's control over society. Gorbachev maintained that perestroika without glasnost was doomed to failure anyway. Others have blamed the economic stagnation and subsequent loss of faith by the general populace in communist ideology. In the final years of the CPSU's existence, the Communist Parties of the federal subjects of Russia were united into the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After the CPSU's demise, the Communist Parties of the Union Republics became independent and underwent various separate paths of reform. In Russia, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation emerged and has been regarded as the inheritor of the CPSU's old Bolshevik legacy into the present day.",

He was tried together with ten others in Sofia from 7 December till 14 December 1949. Two days later he was executed. Kostov was the leading figure of the Bulgarian Communist Party.\n On 31 March 1949 Kostov was dismissed from his post of acting President of the Council of Ministers and President of the Economic-Financial Committee of the Council of Ministers. Fifteen days later he was appointed Director of the Bulgarian National Library in Sofia. At a plenum of the Central Committee held on 11 and 12 June 1949, Vasil Kolarov delivered an indictment of Kostov's anti-Party activity.\n Kostov was accused of tolerating and spreading anti-Soviet sentiment in the Party because of his nationalistic deviation, of using anti-Party methods in the Party and Government leadership and trying to kindle a fractional struggle in the Party, of attempting to cause mistrust in the Communist Party and the Party leader, Georgi Dimitrov. Kostov was dismissed from the Central Committee, expelled from the Party and deprived of his seat in the National Assembly. He was arrested on 20 June 1949.\n In December 1949, together with Traicho Kostov, 10 other prominent Communists were tried. Kostov was sentenced to death on the grounds that he had organized the headquarters of an underground organization aiming to overthrow the government by violence, had committed actions aiming at the worsening of the friendly relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union and the other people's democracies, had placed himself under the orders of the British, American and Yugoslav intelligence services for espionage, that while fulfilling state duties and instructions before foreign governments he had deliberately performed his services and carried out his instructions to the detriment of the state and he had committed acts aiming at the disorganization of the national economy and the supply system of the country and that he had close political connections with Tito, who had broken with Stalin. Kostov repudiated his written confession and the trial proceeded in his absence.\n A further indictment was Kostov's outspoken criticism of the USSR's economic practices in Eastern Europe. At the time, the USSR was buying Bulgarian tobacco at an incredibly low price and then flooding the world market with it - at prices which undercut Bulgaria (G. and N. Swain, 2003). Another example of this type is Polish coal. The other 10 accused prominent Communists, among them ministers and high Party officials, received life imprisonment, 15 or 12 years sentences.\n Kostov's trial was followed in 1950 and 1951 by several other trials against his adherents. During the preparation of these staged trials most inhuman types of interrogation methods were used and more than 30 prominent Communists were sentenced to long term imprisonment.\n The start of open de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union led to a reassessment of the Kostovite trials. On 11 April 1956, at a Sofia City Communist Party meeting it was stated that: a harmful consequence of the personality cult had been the infringement of the laws, as a result of which innocent people were unjustly accused and sentenced.\n The accusations contained in the indictment and in other materials presented at the Traicho Kostov trial and at other trials that followed, in which those sentenced were unjustly accused of espionage, sabotage and criminal relations with Yugoslav state organisations and leaders, were dismissed as being fabricated and not true. All those detained because of these trials had been set free. A commission of the Central Committee had been entrusted with checking the materials on the trials, so that all innocently accused would be rehabilitated.\n A decision of the Central Committee, published on 19 September 1956, approved the statements and the conclusions of the commission which had reviewed the Kostov trial and the trials connected with it.  It also legally rehabilitated and restored party membership to all those convicted in the trials.  Kostov himself was posthumously rehabilitated and readmitted to the party.\n The legal annulment of the sentences had been made by the Bulgarian Supreme Court on 6 November 1956. This decision of the Court was not made public in the Bulgarian press.",

The Bulgarian Communist Party had dominated the Fatherland Front coalition that took power in 1944, late in World War II, after it led a coup against Bulgaria's tsarist regime in conjunction with the Red Army's crossing the border. It controlled its armed forces, the Bulgarian People's Army.\n The BCP was organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle introduced by Russian Marxist scholar Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the BCP was the Party Congress, convened every fifth year. When the Party Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader has held the offices of General Secretary.\n BCP was committed to Marxism-Leninism, an ideology consisted of the writings of the German philosopher Karl Marx and Lenin that was introduced in 1929 by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in which the industries in Bulgaria were nationalized and a planned economy was implemented. In the 1960s, the BCP announced some economic reforms, which allowed the free sale of production that exceeded planned amounts. After Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985, the BCP underwent political and economic liberalization which promptly liquidated the party and dissolved the Bulgarian People's Republic completely. After the end of the BCP, the party was renamed to the Bulgarian Socialist Party in 1990, which retained connections with Russia.",

During World War II, he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. He also served as the President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 14 January 1953 to 4 May 1980. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito has been seen by most as a benevolent dictator.\n He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, alongside Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.\n Broz was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in the village of Kumrovec, Austria-Hungary (now in Croatia). Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during World War I, he was sent to a work camp in the Ural Mountains. He participated in some events of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and subsequent Civil War. \n Upon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (1939\u20131980). During World War II, after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the Partisans (1941\u20131945). \n After the war, he was selected as Prime Minister (1944\u20131963), and President (later President for Life) (1953\u20131980) of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of Marshal of Yugoslavia, serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both Cold War blocs, he received some 98 foreign decorations, including the Legion of Honour and the Order of the Bath.\n Tito was the chief architect of the second Yugoslavia, a socialist federation that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of Cominform, he became the first Cominform member to defy Soviet hegemony in 1948. He was the only leader in Joseph Stalin's time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's own socialist program, which contained elements of market socialism. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born Jaroslav Vanek and Yugoslav-born Branko Horvat, promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the Illyrian model. Firms were socially owned by their employees and structured on workers' self-management; they competed in open and free markets. \n Tito built a very powerful cult of personality around himself, which was maintained by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia after his death.\n Tito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution defined SFR Yugoslavia as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of brotherhood and unity in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to self-determination and secession if done through legal channels. Lastly, Kosovo and Vojvodina, the two constituent provinces of Serbia, received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the Serbian parliament. \n Ten years after his death,  Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe, and Yugoslavia descended into civil war.",

The 1952 show trial involved the Communist Party General Secretary, Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, and his thirteen co-defendants. They were arrested, unjustly accused, tried, and executed as traitors and western spies.

He first studied at a gymnasium, and later at a business college from which he was expelled after discovery of his activism for the communist party. In the 1930s, Reicin became a functionary of a communist youth organization and contributor of the party newspaper Rud\u00e9 Pr\u00e1vo. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1939, he was imprisoned by the Gestapo. He was released after seven months and, in 1940, he managed to flee into the Soviet Union. There he worked as a radio propagandist. After the attack by Germany on Soviet Union, he was interned (as were many people having Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia citizenship). In February 1942, he joined the newly formed First Czechoslovak Army Corps and soon became a propaganda officer there. In 1945, Reicin was named the head of the counter-intelligence service of the Corps, a role he reprised after the war.

Successor to the pro-Bolshevik wing of the Socialist Party of Romania, it gave ideological endorsement to a communist revolution to overthrow the Kingdom of Romania. The PCR was a minor and illegal grouping for much of the interwar period, and submitted to direct Comintern control.

In the early 1950s, the PCR's dominant wing around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, with support from Joseph Stalin, defeated all the other factions and achieved full control over the party and country. After 1953, the Party gradually theorized a \"national path\" to Communism. At the same time, however, the party delayed the time to join its Warsaw Pact brethren in de-Stalinization. The PCR's nationalist and national communist stance was continued under the leadership of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu. Following an episode of liberalization in the late 1960s, Ceau\u0219escu again adopted a hard line, and imposed the \"July Theses\", re-Stalinizing the party's rule by intensifying the spreading of communist ideology in Romanian society and at the same time consolidating his grip on power whilst using the Party's authority to brew a persuasive personality cult. Over the years, the PCR massively and artificially increased in size, becoming entirely submitted to Ceau\u0219escu's will. From the 1960s onward, it had a reputation for being somewhat more independent of the Soviet Union than its brethren in the Warsaw Pact. However, at the same time it became one of the most hardline parties in the Eastern Bloc. It collapsed in 1989 in the wake of the Romanian Revolution.\n The PCR coordinated several organizations during its existence, including the Union of Communist Youth, and organized training for its cadres at the \u0218tefan Gheorghiu Academy. In addition to Sc\u00eenteia, its official platform and main newspaper between 1931 and 1989, the Communist Party issued several local and national publications at various points in its history (including, after 1944, Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103).",
  "/wiki/Securitate": "The Securitate (pronounced\u00a0[sekuri\u02c8tate], Romanian for Security) was the popular term for the Departamentul Securit\u0103\u021bii Statului (Department of State Security), the secret police agency of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Previously, before the communist regime, Romanian secret police was called Siguran\u021ba Statului. It was founded on 30 August 1948, with help from the Soviet NKVD, while Romania was practically under the Red Army's occupation. Following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu in 1989, the DSS lived on until 1991, when Parliament approved a law reorganizing the DSS into various subdivisions. \n The Securitate was, in proportion to Romania's population, one of the largest secret police forces in the Eastern bloc.  The first budget of the Securitate in 1948 stipulated a number of 4,641 positions, of which 3,549 were filled by February 1949: 64% were workers, 4% peasants, 28% clerks, 2% persons of unspecified origin, and 2% intellectuals.[citation needed] By 1951, the Securitate's staff had increased fivefold, while in January 1956, the Securitate had 25,468 employees. At its height, the Securitate employed some 11,000 agents and had a half-million informers for a country with a population of 22 million by 1985. Under Ceau\u0219escu, the Securitate was one of the most brutal secret police forces in the world, responsible for the arrests, torture and deaths of thousands of people.",
  "/wiki/Ana_Pauker": "Ana Pauker (born Hannah Rabinsohn; 13 February 1893 \u2013 3 June 1960) was a Romanian communist leader and served as the country's foreign minister in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Ana Pauker became the world's first female foreign minister when entering office in December 1947. She was also the unofficial leader of the Romanian Communist Party immediately after World War II.",
  "/wiki/Rootless_cosmopolitan": "Rootless cosmopolitan (Russian: \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442, romanized:\u00a0bezrodnyi kosmopolit) was a pejorative Soviet euphemism widely used during the anti-Semitic campaign of 1946\u20131953, which culminated in the \"exposure\" of the non-existent Doctors' plot.  The term \"rootless cosmopolitan\" referred mostly to Jewish intellectuals, as an accusation of their lack of patriotism, i.e., lack of full allegiance to the Soviet Union. The campaign against \"rootless cosmopolitans\" began in 1946, when Joseph Stalin in his speech in Moscow attacked writers who were ethnic Jews. The expression was coined in the 19th century by Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky to describe writers who lacked Russian national character.",

  "/wiki/Vasile_Luca": "Vasile Luca (born L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Luka; 8 June 1898 \u2013 23 July 1963) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian and Soviet communist politician, a leading member of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) from 1945 and until his imprisonment in the 1950s. Noted for his activities in the Ukrainian SSR in 1940\u20131941, he sided with Ana Pauker during World War II, and returned to Romania to serve as the minister of finance and one of the most recognizable leaders of the Communist regime. Luca's downfall, coming at the end of a conflict with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, signaled that of Pauker.\n He was married to Elisabeta Luca (n\u00e9e Betty Birman), a volunteer in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, who was also imprisoned following her husband's arrest.",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Bloc_politics": "Eastern Bloc politics followed the Red Army's liberation of much of eastern Europe at the end of World War II and the Soviet Union's installation of Soviet-controlled Marxist\u2013Leninist governments in the Eastern Bloc through a process of bloc politics and repression. The resulting governments contained vestiges of representative democracy (such as parliaments, elections, and sometimes even multiple political parties) to initially conceal the process.\n Once in power, each country's Soviet-controlled Communist Party took permanent control of the administration, political organs, police, societal organizations and economic structures to ensure that no effective opposition could arise and to control socioeconomic and political life therein. Party and social purges were employed along with the extensive use of secret police organizations modeled on the Soviet KGB to monitor and control local populations. While multiple political parties continued to nominally exist in some countries, they were all subordinated to the government, and supported government policies. While elections continued to be held, voters were usually presented with a single candidate. The national parliaments composed of representatives elected in this manner met infrequently and always approved government proposals."
