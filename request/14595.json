He is best remembered for leading NCAA Division I in scoring as a senior in 1978\u201379 and then getting selected by the Chicago Bulls in that year's NBA draft, although he ultimately never played a game in the league. Lawrence was from Glasgow, Missouri and played college basketball at Western Texas Community College for two years before playing at Idaho State for his final two seasons.\n In Lawrence's junior year, his first at Idaho State, he averaged 23.8 points in 26 games played, which led the conference in scoring. The following season, Lawrence's per-game scoring average jumped to 30.1, beating out future Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Bird of Indiana State for the national scoring title. He was the first ever recipient of the Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year award and was selected to play in the Aloha Classic Basketball All-Star Game, in which the nation's top players were chosen to play. Butler scored a game-high 18 points as his West team defeated the Midwest team, 119\u2013107.\n After his collegiate career had ended, the Chicago Bulls selected him as the 11th pick in the second round (33rd overall) but he never made the team's final roster.

The Cornhuskers traveled to the Kibbie Dome in early January, led by former Vandal head coach Joe Cipriano, stricken with cancer. The attendance was 5,500, the second-largest attendance for basketball on campus at the time.\n Idaho lost their first three conference games in early January, then won nine of eleven to end the regular season at 9\u20135 and 17\u20139 overall. An NIT invitation was likely if they won their first game of the Big Sky tourney at Ogden, Utah (and an NCAA tourney berth with two wins).\n The Vandals met Montana in the semifinals, whom they had swept in the regular season, but lost the third meeting on the neutral court. Sensing that Montana was a less formidable opponent in the finals for host Weber State, the Ogden fans sided with Montana and the Grizzlies outscored the Vandals 16\u20132 in the final five minutes and won by ten points.

The defending champions of the Big Sky Conference, Vandals were led by fourth-year head coach Don Monson and played their home games on campus at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Idaho.\n The 1982 basketball team was the most successful in the school's history, and has yet to be surpassed. Building upon the success of the previous season, the Vandals won their first 16 games and went 24\u20132 in the regular season.  They defeated Gonzaga and all four Pac-10 teams from the Northwest. Idaho won the eight-team Far West Classic in Portland in late December 1981, winning all three games by at least 19 points (over Iowa State, Oregon State, and Oregon).\n The Vandals' only setbacks during the regular season were consecutive two-point road losses in late January. The first was to rival Montana on a raucous Saturday night in Missoula on a tip-in at the buzzer. The second was to Notre Dame in South Bend two days later, ending a three-games-in-four-nights road trip, which included multiple weather-related travel delays and re-routes, and a 4:30 am arrival in South Bend on game day. Although the Vandals hit 14 of their first 15 shots to jump to 28\u201310 lead over the Irish, Notre Dame regrouped at home to win by two in overtime. Idaho was awarded just four free throws in the 45 minutes of play and missed them all. Notre Dame was led by future NBA guard John Paxson in 1982. The Vandals then won eight straight games to conclude the regular season, and won the four-team conference tournament, which they hosted for the second straight year as regular season champions.\n Their 26\u20132 record after the Big Sky tournament (& ten straight victories) earned the Vandals a #8 national ranking and a #3 seed in the West region of the 48-team NCAA tournament, which included a first round bye.\n Idaho's first game (in the second round) was nearly a home game, played just eight miles (13 km) west at Beasley Coliseum in Pullman on a Sunday afternoon.  The opponent was 16th-ranked Iowa of the Big Ten, the region's sixth seed, then coached by Lute Olson.  A Final Four team two years earlier, Iowa won their first-round game handily, but Idaho won this close game by two points, 69\u201367 in overtime, and advanced to the Sweet 16 at the West regional in Provo, Utah.  There the Vandals met the nation's fourth-ranked team, Oregon State, the #2 seed in the West region.  Idaho had defeated the Beavers by 22 points in December at the Far West Classic in Portland, but this time the result was far different, as the Beavers won 60\u201342.  OSU was defeated two days later by the region's #1 seed Georgetown, led by freshman center Patrick Ewing. (Georgetown advanced to the national final, where they lost by a point to North Carolina.)\n The Vandals ended the 1982 season at 27\u20133 (.900), and were ranked as high as sixth in the nation (AP and UPI polls) at the end of the regular season at 24\u20132. They entered the top twenty at #18 in early January and two weeks later were up to eighth, but the two losses dropped them back to fifteenth. Eight straight wins elevated them to sixth prior to the Big Sky tournament, and were eighth in both final polls entering the NCAA tournament.\n The 1982 starters Ken Owens (6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)) and Brian Kellerman (6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)) in the backcourt, with forwards Phil Hopson and Gordie Herbert and center Kelvin Smith, all at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m). Just before their two losses in January, the team was featured in a two-page article in Sports Illustrated. (team photo)  The alley-oop was a frequently used play against man-to-man defenses.\n Monson was named the Kodak Coach of the Year in Division I in 1982 (photo) and rumors were rampant that he would jump to a higher league, maybe to struggling Arizona in the Pac-10.  That position was eventually filled by Lute Olson (a year later), and Monson chose to stay for another year at Idaho. With a salary of about $40,000 in 1982 and a one-year contract, an \"appreciation fund\" was set up by local fans to entice him to stay in Moscow. The 1982 team was inducted into the Vandal Athletics Hall of Fame, as was Monson.",
  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football, a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer (association football). They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game.\n A point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills. Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team, or sometimes for themselves. Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates. This involves setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score, and controlling the tempo of the game. A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets. Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders. A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock, the score, the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams, etc.\n Among the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is Ben Simmons, who at 6\u2019 10\u201d won the 2018 National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year Award. Behind him is Magic Johnson, who at 6\u2019 9\u201d (2.06 m) won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award three times in his career. Other point guards who have been named NBA MVP include Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook, and two-time winners Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. In the NBA, point guards are usually about 6' 4\" (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 1\" (1.85 m) without shoes whereas in the WNBA, point guards are usually 5' 8\" (1.73 m) or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. At 5'3\" the shortest player in NBA history, Muggsy Bogues enjoyed a 14 year career as a point guard. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling. \n After an opponent scores, it's typically the point guard who brings the ball down court to begin an offensive play. Passing skills, ball handling, and court vision are crucial. Speed is important; a speedy point guard is better able to create separation and space off the dribble, giving themselves room to work. Point guards are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. Another major evaluation factor is assist-to-turnover ratio, which reflects the decision-making skills of the player. Still, a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective jump shot.",

  "/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)": "The power forward (PF), also known as the four, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. Power forwards play a role similar to that of center. They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, one of which is rebounding. Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m).  Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals.\n In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 (1.98 m) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 (2.08 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 (1.83 m) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 (1.91 m). Despite the averages, a variety of players fit \"tweener\" roles which finds them in the small forward or center position depending on matchups and coaching decisions.[citation needed] Some power forwards often play the center position and have the skills, but lack the height that is usually associated with that position.\n Power forwards that are inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Karl Malone, Denise Curry, Dolph Schayes, Kevin McHale, Charles Barkley, Elvin Hayes, Bob Pettit, Dennis Rodman, and Katrina McClain Johnson.",

  "/wiki/Center_(basketball)": "The center (C), also known as the five position, or the big man, is one of the five positions in a basketball game.

In the NBA, the center is usually 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) or taller and usually weighs 240 pounds (110 kg) or more. They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post. \n Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency. In the 1950s and 1960s, George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979\u201380 season, however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished.

In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6' 4\" (1.93 m) to 6' 8\" (2.03 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, small forwards are usually between 5' 10\" (1.78 m) to 6' 1\" (1.85 m). \n Small forwards are responsible for scoring points, defending and often as secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center, although a few have considerable passing responsibilities. Many small forwards in professional basketball are prolific scorers.\n The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely. Some players at the position are very accurate shooters, others prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players, and still others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots. In some cases, small forwards position on the baseline or as off-the-ball specialists. Small forwards who are defensive specialists are very versatile as they can often guard multiple positions using their size, speed, and strength.\n Small forwards that are inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Julius Erving, Cheryl Miller, Larry Bird, Sheryl Swoopes, James Worthy, Elgin Baylor, Scottie Pippen, Dominique Wilkins and Rick Barry.",
