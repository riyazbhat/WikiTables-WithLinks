  "/wiki/Dreamlanders": "Dreamlanders are the cast and crew of regulars whom John Waters has used in his films. The term comes from the name of Waters' production company, Dreamland Productions.\n Many of the original Dreamlanders were friends of Waters from his native Baltimore, Maryland.

This crowd was drawn to downtown Baltimore by the gay scene, where Divine introduced Waters to David Lochary.",
  "/wiki/Brandy_in_the_Wilderness": "Brandy in the Wilderness is a 1971 American drama film directed by Stanton Kaye. On December 18, 2013, the Library of Congress announced that this film had been selected for the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\n The film is a partly fictionalized account of the real-life professional and intimate relationship that developed between prodigious filmmaker Kaye and aspiring artist Michaux French, which began when they met in 1965. Kaye's character is named Simon Weiss and French is named Brandy, while their actual parents and other friends and acquaintances appear in the film, uncredited and often unnamed. Most of the scenes are depicted with either voiceover or without sound; only a limited number of moments feature live dialogue being delivered by the participants. These are occasional interjections of stock footage from major film productions, still photos of family members and well-known performers, and moments of blank screen featuring hand-dyed colors (which Kaye chose and supervised himself).",

  "/wiki/Pink_Flamingos": "Pink Flamingos is a 1972 American exploitation comedy film directed, written, produced, narrated, filmed, and edited by John Waters. By far Waters' best-known movie, it is part of what Waters has labelled the Trash Trilogy, which also includes Female Trouble (1974) and Desperate Living (1977). The film stars the countercultural drag queen Divine as a criminal living under the name of Babs Johnson, who is proud to be the filthiest person alive. While living in a trailer with Edie (Edith Massey) and Crackers (Danny Mills)\u2014her mother and son respectively\u2014and her companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), Divine is confronted by the Marbles (David Lochary and Mink Stole), a pair of criminals envious of her reputation who try to outdo her in filth. The characters engage in several grotesque, bizarre, and explicitly crude situations. The movie was filmed in and in the vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland; Waters grew up in suburban Baltimore. Displaying the tagline An exercise in poor taste, Pink Flamingos is notorious for its outrageousness, nudity, profanity, and pursuit of frivolity, scatology, sensationology  [sic] and skewed epistemology. It features a number of increasingly revolting scenes that centre on exhibitionism, voyeurism, sodomy, masturbation, gluttony, vomiting, rape, incest, murder, cannibalism, castration, foot fetishism, and concludes, to the accompaniment of How Much Is That Doggy in the Window?",
  "/wiki/Reefer_Madness_(1936_film)": "Reefer Madness (originally made as Tell Your Children and sometimes titled as The Burning Question, Dope Addict, Doped Youth, and Love Madness) is a 1936 American film about drugs revolving around the melodramatic events that ensue when high-school students are lured by pushers to try marijuana\u2014from a hit and run accident, to manslaughter, suicide, attempted rape, hallucinations, and descent into madness from marijuana addiction. The film was directed by Louis J. Gasnier and featured a cast of mainly little-known actors.\n Originally financed by a church group under the title Tell Your Children, the film was intended to be shown to parents as a morality tale attempting to teach them about the dangers of cannabis use. But soon after the film was shot, it was purchased by producer Dwain Esper, who re-cut the film for distribution on the exploitation film circuit, exploiting vulgar interest while escaping censorship under the guise of moral guidance, beginning in 1938\u20131939 through the 1940s and 1950s.\n The film was rediscovered in the early 1970s and gained new life as an unintentional satire among advocates of cannabis policy reform. However, critics have called it one of the worst films ever made. Today, it is in the public domain in the United States.",
  "/wiki/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre[note 1] is a 1974 American slasher film directed by Tobe Hooper and written and co-produced by Hooper and Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate; although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional. Hooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($700,000 adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually aqcuired by Louis Perano of Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.",
