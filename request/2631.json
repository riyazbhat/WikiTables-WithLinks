  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",
  "/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center": "Alta Wind Energy Center (AWEC), also known as Mojave Wind Farm, is the third largest onshore wind energy project in the world. The Alta Wind Energy Center is a wind farm located in Tehachapi Pass of the Tehachapi Mountains, in Kern County, California. As of 2013, it is the largest wind farm in the United States, with a combined installed capacity of 1,550\u00a0MW (2,080,000\u00a0hp). The project, being developed near Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm\u2014 site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s\u2014is \"a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects\".\nSouthern California Edison has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1,500\u00a0MW (2,000,000\u00a0hp) or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the Tehachapi area. The project will \"reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons, which is equivalent to taking 446,000 cars off the road\". A total of 3,000\u00a0MW (4,000,000\u00a0hp) is planned.\n The wind farm was developed by Terra-Gen Power which closed a US$1.2\u00a0billion financing deal in July 2010 with partners that included Citibank, Barclays Capital, and Credit Suisse. After many delays, the first phase began construction in 2010. Financing for additional phases of $650 million was secured in April 2012. Construction of the Alta Wind Energy Center is expected to create more than 3,000\u00a0domestic manufacturing, construction, and maintenance jobs, and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy.
