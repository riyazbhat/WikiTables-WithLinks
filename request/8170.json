  "/wiki/John_Ash_House": "The John Ash House, also known as Rowan House, Coker House and Rickles House, is a historic residence near Ashville, Alabama.  John Ash emigrated from York County, South Carolina, first to Georgia, later settling in what is today St. Clair County, Alabama in 1817.  Ash became a successful farmer, and served as a judge and member of the first Alabama State Senate.  In 1821 Ash was one of five local leaders appointed to oversee the construction of a county courthouse and jail; the county seat was later named Ashville in his honor.  Ash built a one-story dogtrot log house around 1820.  In the 1830s, the house was extensively modified: three rooms and a second story were added to the house, and the exterior was covered with frame siding.  The central dogtrot was filled in, and the main portion now resembled an I-house.  A triangular pedimented gable adorns the front of the house, and each side has a brick chimney.  A porch was added to the front of the house in the early 1900s.  The house was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1990 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.",

The area around the \"Big Spring\" remained sparsely populated from 1814, when the land was ceded to the United States by the Creek Nation, until after the Civil War.  A post office was established in 1834, and a sawmill was founded in 1861, but development did not begin in earnest until the coming of the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad in 1870.  Now connected to Atlanta and Columbus, Mississippi, business and industry began to center in Springville, and the town was a center for moving ore from the surrounding hills to industrial centers in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa.\n The town was incorporated in 1881, and it is from this period that the district's oldest buildings date.  Several high-style Victorian houses, including some Queen Anne, are spread throughout the town, including the town's first school.  Many commercial buildings from this time were destroyed in a fire in 1897.  The commercial core was rebuilt and expanded over the next few decades, mostly in simple brick styles, but some (including the Presley Store built in 1902) with more elaborate details.  Later houses were mostly bungalows and cottages with Victorian elements, although some Craftsman houses were built as well.  In addition, several churches, a cotton mill, and a Masonic temple are still in existence.\n The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.",
  "/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway": "The Norfolk Southern Railway (reporting mark NS) is a Class I freight railroad in the United States. With headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, the company operates 19,420 miles (31,250 km) route miles in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia, and has rights in Canada over the Albany to Montr\u00e9al route of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and previously on CN from Buffalo to St. Thomas. NS is responsible for maintaining 28,400 miles (45,700 km), with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance. The most common commodity hauled on the railway is coal from mines in Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The railway also offers the largest intermodal network in eastern North America.\n NS is a major transporter of domestic and export coal. The railway's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, as well as the Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the \"Clearfield Cluster\". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N&W double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railways. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers (highway truck trailers with interchangeable wheel sets).\n Norfolk Southern is the namesake and leading subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Corporation, also based in Norfolk. Norfolk Southern Corporation was incorporated on July 23, 1980, in the Commonwealth of Virginia and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol NSC. The primary business function of Norfolk Southern Corporation is the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods across the Southeast, East, and Midwest United States.
