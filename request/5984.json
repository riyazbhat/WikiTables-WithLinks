  "/wiki/Pendant": "The word pendant derives from the Latin word pendere and Old French word pendr, both of which translate to \"to hang down\". It comes in the form of a loose-hanging piece of jewellery, generally attached by a small loop to a necklace, which may be known as a \"pendant necklace\". A pendant earring is an earring with a piece hanging down.  In modern French, pendant is the gerund form of pendre (\" to hang\") and also means \"during\". The extent to which the design of a pendant can be incorporated into an overall necklace makes it not always accurate to treat them as separate items.",
  "/wiki/Almandine": "Almandine (/\u02c8\u00e6lm\u0259nd\u026an/), also known as almandite, is a species of mineral belonging to the garnet group.

Viewed through the spectroscope in a strong light, it generally shows three characteristic absorption bands.",
  "/wiki/Treasure_of_Nagyszentmikl%C3%B3s": "The Treasure of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s is an important hoard of 23 early medieval gold vessels, in total weighing 9.945\u00a0kg (about 22\u00a0lbs), found in 1799 near the modern Romanian town of S\u00e2nnicolau Mare, then in Austria-Hungary. The town was called then Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s in Hungarian or Gro\u00df-Sankt-Niklaus in German, all meaning \"Great St Nicholas\". After the excavation, the treasure was transferred to Vienna, the capital of the empire. Ever since, it has been in the possession of the Kunsthistorisches Museum there, where it is on permanent display. A wide range of views continue to be held as to the dating and the origins of the styles of the pieces, and the context in which they were made, which may well vary between the pieces. Unusually, the inscriptions on some pieces have increased the complexity of the arguments rather than reduced them. Recently,[when?] Romanian officials have asked the Austrian government for the treasure's repatriation.",
