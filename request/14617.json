After the war Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous  Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\n It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\n Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\n Because of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\n Along with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011.

  "/wiki/List_of_medieval_stone_churches_in_Finland": "This is a list of medieval stone churches in Finland. A total number of 104 fieldstone churches were built between the 13th and 16th century, of which 83 have been preserved. Numbers include the sacristies of uncompleted churches as well as three churches in Vyborg which is now part of Russia.\n The construction years for each church are listed in accordance with the 1994 PhD thesis of historian Markus Hiekkanen, \"Suomen keskiajan kivikirkot\" (Finnish medieval stone churches), although since the publication of his thesis it has emerged that some historians disagree with some of the dates he offers. Until Hiekkanen's research, most of the churches were generally considered 100\u2013200 years older.\n The provinces in this list refer to the historical provinces of Finland which differ from the modern regions of Finland."
