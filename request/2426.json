After the election of his uncle to the papacy (1 September 1181) he was named Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church (ca.1182/84), and then cardinal-deacon of S. Adriano (probably in December 1182). He signed the papal bulls between 2 January 1183 and 19 April 1204. He was Cardinal Vicar General of Rome from 1184 until 1188. He participated in the papal election, 1191 and papal election, 1198.

  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Ravenna": "This page is a list of Roman Catholic bishops and archbishops of Ravenna and, from 1985, of the Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.

  "/wiki/Pelagio_Galvani": "Pelagio Galvani (b. ca. 1165, Gusendos, Le\u00f3n - d. 30 January 1230, Montecassino) was a Leonese Cardinal, and canon lawyer. He became a papal legate and leader of the Fifth Crusade. His early life is little known. It is repeatedly claimed that he entered the Order of Benedictines but this is not proven. Pope Innocent III created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Lucia in Septisolio around 1206. Later, he was promoted to the rank of Cardinal-Priest of S. Cecilia (probably on 2 April 1211), and finally opted for the suburbicarian see of Albano in the spring of 1213. He subscribed the papal bulls between 4 May 1207 and 26 January 1230. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople in 1213. During this two-year mission he attempted to close Orthodox churches and imprison the clergy, but this caused such domestic upset that Henry of Flanders, the Latin Emperor, reversed his actions which had caused the tempest which held the city of Constantine in its grip, as noted a contemporary historian. Three years later he was elected Latin Patriarch of Antioch but his election was not ratified by the Holy See. Dispatched by Pope Honorius III to lead the Fifth Crusade at Damietta in Egypt, he made a poor strategic decision in turning down peace offers made by Al-Kamil.",

  "/wiki/Cathedral_chapter": "According to both Anglican and Catholic canon law, a cathedral chapter is a college of clerics (chapter) formed to advise a bishop and, in the case of a vacancy of the episcopal see in some countries, to govern the diocese during the vacancy. These chapters are made up of canons and other officers, while in the Church of England chapters now includes a number of lay appointees; in the Roman Catholic Church their creation is the purview of the pope. [citation needed] They can be numbered, in which case they are provided with a fixed prebend, or unnumbered, in which case the bishop indicates the number of canons according to the rents. In some Church of England cathedrals there are two such bodies, the lesser and greater chapters, which have different functions. The smaller body usually consists of the residentiary members and is included in the larger one. Originally, it referred to a section of a monastic rule that was read out daily during the assembly of a group of canons or other clergy attached to a cathedral or collegiate church. Later it came to be applied to the group of clergy itself.",
