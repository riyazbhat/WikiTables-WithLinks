  "/wiki/Burra_Burra_Mine_(Ducktown,_Tennessee)": "The Burra Burra Mine is a copper mine located in Ducktown, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States.  Named for the famous mine in Australia, the Burra Burra Mine extracted over 15 million tons (14 million metric tons) of copper ore during its 60 years of operation between 1899 and 1959.  The mine's remaining structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Burra Burra Mine Historic District.  The site is also home to the Ducktown Basin Museum, and the museum and mine are a Tennessee State Historic Site operated in partnership with the Tennessee Historical Commission.\n The Burra Burra Mine was one of a number of mining operations in the Copper Basin from 1850 to 1987 that produced substantial amounts of copper ore that contained sulfur. Trees were cut to smelt the ore and burn off the sulfur.  Both the tree-harvesting and the sulfuric acid pollution left more than 32,000 acres (50\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\u2014(13,000 hectares (130\u00a0km2)\u2014 of the basin eroded and virtually devoid of life, though the area has begun to recover after decades of re-greening efforts.",

  "/wiki/Copperhill,_Tennessee": "Copperhill is a city in Polk County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 354 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n Starting around the time of the Civil War, the production method for removing the Sulphur from the copper ore mined in the area required building bonfires, throwing in the ore, and burning off the Sulphur.  This necessitated cutting most of the trees in the valley for the bonfires.  The acid rain caused by the burning of the Sulphur inhibited additional vegetation from growing, and the topsoil consequently washed off the hilly terrain due to lack of vegetation to hold it.  Though acid plants were later built to convert the Sulphur into a useful product, the result of the earlier activities was that for years, up until the 1980s, the area was denuded of any greenery, and the red clay soil remaining gave it a Martian appearance.  The area has now been greatly reforested, due to a multimillion-dollar effort by the successor companies to the original copper company.  The copper and acid plants have been permanently closed and most of the plant infrastructure already removed and sold overseas.  Much of the scrap metals from the site have been removed and sold to China.  Glenn Springs Holdings has cleaned and purified all the surrounding creeks and waterways, and water quality is now back to near pristine condition according to published EPA and Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation studies.\n The town these days is a tourist attraction, with near daily rail excursions from Blue Ridge, Georgia, on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway, and near daily rail excursions from The Gee Creek Wilderness on the Hiwassee River train route.  Whitewater rafting on the Ocoee River also attracts many people and other outdoor activities such as Mountain Biking and Hiking are also popular in the area. The area was the host for the whitewater portion of the 1996 Summer Olympics.",

  "/wiki/Kimsey_Junior_College": "Located in Ducktown, Tennessee, Kimsey Junior College was originally constructed in 1933 by the Fourth Fractional Township with the intention of serving as a junior college for the region.  The building is named for one of the commissioners of the township at the time its construction was commissioned.  Due to the isolation of the Copper Basin from major population centers in the state, the building was never used for its intended purpose.  \n The Kimsey Junior College building remained vacant until 1938 when Ducktown High School and Ducktown Elementary School relocated to the site.  The High School remained in the building until 1956.  The elementary school remained in the facility until 2006 when an agreement was reached to consolidate Ducktown and Turtletown Elementary Schools. Although the site was more centrally located for consolidation, concerns over ownership and maintenance costs led to the decision to choose another site. The new location chosen was the old Copper Basin High School building thus the Kimsey Junior College building was vacated.   In September 1992, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  \n Since 2007, the site has remained vacant although there has been interest expressed in the building for use as a community center, office space, and an assisted living facility.  The building is still owned and maintained by the Fourth Fractional Township, one of the last remaining entities of its kind in the state.  The township consists of a three-person board which provides security for the site and maintenance of the 150 acre tract the building occupies.\n Kimsey Junior College is noted for the construction materials as well as its architecture.  Designed by architect Reuben H. Hunt as a Collegiate Gothic style building, Kimsey Junior College is the only structure designed by an architect in the Copper Basin. The inside of the building also shows the expense used in its construction and contains a large auditorium and gymnasium. \n The site is beginning to show signs of disrepair due to its age and vacancy.  The parking lot in front of the building is becoming overgrown, several windows and doors are damaged, and remnants of the elementary school are still inside the building.  In 2008, the building was placed on Tennessee\u2019s list of most endangered historic sites on the national register by the Tennessee Preservation Trust. In 2009, grant funds from the National Park Service were used to make repairs to the roof and walls of the structure; however work is still required to complete roof repairs.\n The site is now blocked off to the public until it is proven safe enough for entrance, it is still unknown as to what this building will be in the future.",

  "/wiki/Ocoee_River": "The Toccoa River and Ocoee River are the names in use for a single 93-mile-long (150\u00a0km) river that flows northwestward through the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States. It is a tributary of the Hiwassee River, which it joins in Polk County, Tennessee, near the town of Benton. Three power generating dams are operated along it.\nIt is famous for its whitewater rapids on the Tennessee side.\n The river is called the Toccoa for its 56 miles (90\u00a0km) through Georgia, until it reaches the twin cities of McCaysville, Georgia and Copperhill, Tennessee, at the truss bridge which connects Georgia 5 (Blue Ridge Street) with Tennessee 68 and Georgia 60 (Ocoee Street and Toccoa Street).  The remainder is called the Ocoee through Tennessee, known for its whitewater rafting, and host to whitewater slalom events during the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics held primarily in Atlanta, about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) to the south.\n The name Ocoee originates from the Cherokee name for Passiflora incarnata, ocoee. Toccoa comes from the Cherokee term for \"where the Catawbas lived\"  or \"beautiful\".\n On February 16, 1990 flooding of the river submerged much of the central business district of the riverfront towns of Copperhill, Tennessee and McCaysville, Georgia. The area was once heavily mined for copper ore from the Copper Basin and polluted by smelting operations. Extensive logging and plant destroying smog depleted topsoil and polluted acid and metals into the area's streams. The area has since been cleaned and greened. Olympic kayaker Joe Jacobi led a successful effort to bring the Atlanta Olympic white-water event to the Ocoee River in 1996, and his wife Lisa, a former CNN news producer, left her job to open a downtown bed-and-breakfast and become a local internet entrepreneur.",
