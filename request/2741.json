  "/wiki/Hawaii_Belt_Road": "The Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road is a modern name for the M\u0101malahoa Highway and consists of Hawai\u02bbi state Routes 11, 19, and 190 that encircle the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. The southern section, between Hilo and Kailua-Kona is numbered as Route 11. The section between Hilo and Waimea is Route 19. Between Waimea and Kailua-Kona, the road is split in two: the original \"mauka\" route (now Route 190) and a \"makai\" Route 19, completed in 1975, which serves as access to the Kona and Kohala Coast resorts. In the Hawaiian language, mauka means \"towards the mountain\" and makai means \"towards the sea\". These terms are commonly used in travel directions.\n Parts of the southern half of the Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road were known during the Territorial days as the Ka\u02bb\u016b Belt Road.

  "/wiki/Hawaii_Volcanoes_National_Park": "Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park, established on August 1, 1916, is an American national park located in the U.S. state of Hawaii on the island of Hawaii. The park encompasses two active volcanoes: K\u012blauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa, the world's most massive shield volcano. The park provides scientists with insight into the birth and development of the Hawaiian Islands, and ongoing studies into the processes of volcanism. For visitors, the park offers dramatic volcanic landscapes, as well as glimpses of rare flora and fauna.\n In recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park was designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987. In 2012, the park was depicted on the 14th quarter of the America the Beautiful Quarters series.\n On May 11, 2018, the park was closed to the public in the K\u012blauea volcano summit area, including the visitor center and park headquarters, due to explosions and toxic ash clouds from Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu, as well as earthquakes and road damage. Portions of the park, including the visitor center, reopened to the public on September 22, 2018. As of 2019[update], most of the park is open; however, some road segments and trails, the Thurston Lava Tube, and the Jaggar Museum of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory remain closed to visitors.\n Eruptive activity, ground collapses and explosions in the park ceased in early August of 2018, and the lull in eruptive activity at K\u012blauea continues.",
  "/wiki/Ainahou_Ranch": "The Shipman family leased 6,324 acres (2,559\u00a0ha) of land near the K\u012blauea volcano in 1937 from the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, which they called the Ainahou Ranch. The name \u02bbaina hou means \"new land\". An older ranch called Keauhou (not to be confused with the community of Keauhou, on the western side of the island) had been established here in 1921, so a primitive trail existed, and the Chain of Craters Road had recently been built within a few miles. Herbert C. Shipman built a house on the remote ranch in 1941 for the family as a refuge for the anticipated Japanese invasion of Hawaii. It was used as a working cattle ranch, raising beef for the military during World War II.\n After a tsunami in 1946 devastated the Puna Shipman property, killing half the endangered n\u0113n\u0113 he was raising there, he built pens at Ainahou to continue raising them. After the war, it was estimated only about 30 birds existed in the wild. Herbert Shipman reintroduced two pairs to the Pohakuloa Training Area, and worked with British ornithologist Peter Scott to expand the breeding program to England, possibly saving the species from extinction. The shipman family also kept many exotic plants at the ranch, including some of the first orchids raised on the island. Herbert (president of the Hawaii Orchid Society) was awarded a gold medal in 1957 by the American Orchid Society for contributions to the industry.\n After being threatened by a lava flow in 1969, the house was evacuated. The family reached an agreement for the National Park Service to purchase the land and house in 1971 to become part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, under the authority of the Endangered Species Act. Ainahou ranch was listed on the state register of historic places on December 5, 1973, as site 10-62-19429, and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on June 23, 1978, as site 78001013. and the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on February 8, 1995, as site 94001619.",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War\u00a0II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries\u2014including all the great powers\u2014eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War\u00a0II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.\n Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with China by 1937,[b] though neither side had declared war on the other. World War\u00a0II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the Fall of France in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire. War in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz, and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This Eastern Front trapped the Axis, most crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the United States as well as European colonies in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.\n The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in Central China, South China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6\u00a0and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the Germans and against the Japanese.\n World War\u00a0II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014became the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.",
  "/wiki/Hawaiian_goose": "The nene (Branta sandvicensis or sandwicensis), also known as n\u0113n\u0113 and Hawaiian goose, is a species of bird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The official bird of the state of Hawai\u02bbi, the nene is exclusively found in the wild on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Kaua\u02bbi, Molokai, and Hawai\u02bbi.\n The Hawaiian name n\u0113n\u0113 comes from its soft call. The specific name sandvicensis refers to the Sandwich Islands, a former name for the Hawaiian Islands.\n It is thought that the nene evolved from the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), which most likely arrived on the Hawaiian islands about 500,000 years ago, shortly after the island of Hawai\u02bbi was formed. This ancestor is the progenitor of the nene as well as the prehistoric Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose(Branta rhuax) and n\u0113n\u0113-nui (Branta hylobadistes). The n\u0113n\u0113-nui was larger than the nene, varied from flightless to flighted depending on the individual, and inhabited the island of Maui. Similar fossil geese found on O\u02bbahu and Kaua\u02bbi may be of the same species. The Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose was restricted to the island of Hawai\u02bbi and measured 1.2\u00a0m (3.9\u00a0ft) in length with a mass of 8.6\u00a0kg (19\u00a0lb), making it more than four times larger than the nene. It is believed that the herbivorous Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose occupied the same ecological niche as the goose-like ducks known as moa-nalo, which were not present on the Big Island. Based on mitochondrial DNA found in fossils, all Hawaiian geese, living and dead, are closely related to the giant Canada goose (B. c. maxima) and dusky Canada goose (B. c. occidentalis).",

The largest subaerial volcano in both mass and volume, Mauna Loa has historically been considered the largest volcano on Earth, dwarfed only by Tamu Massif. It is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000\u00a0km3), although its peak is about 125 feet (38\u00a0m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea. Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor and very fluid, and they tend to be non-explosive.\n Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000\u00a0years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000\u00a0years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000\u00a0years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which has been responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years.

Historically, K\u012blauea is the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawai\u02bbi. Located along the southeastern shore of the island, the volcano is between 210,000 and 280,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago.\n It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, K\u012blauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Structurally, K\u012blauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending 125\u00a0km (78\u00a0mi) east and the other 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) west, as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20\u00a0mm (0.1 to 0.8\u00a0in) per year.\n K\u012blauea erupted nearly continuously from 1983 to 2018, causing considerable property damage, including the destruction of the towns of Kalapana and Kaim\u016b along with the renowned black sand beach, in 1990. During the 2018 lower Puna eruption, two dozen lava vents erupted downrift from the summit in Puna. The eruption was accompanied by a strong earthquake on May 4 of Mw 6.9, and nearly 2,000 residents were evacuated from the rural Leilani Estates subdivision and nearby areas.\n On May 17, 2018 the volcano explosively erupted at the summit in Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu, throwing ash 30,000 feet into the air. Continued explosive activity at the summit caused a months-long closure of the K\u012blauea section of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Vigorous eruptive lava fountains in lower Puna sent destructive rivers of molten rock into the ocean in three places. The lava destroyed Hawaii's largest natural freshwater lake, covered substantial portions of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, and completely inundated the communities of Kapoho, Vacationland Hawaii and most of the Kapoho Beach Lots. Lava also filled Kapoho Bay and extended new land nearly a mile into the sea. The County of Hawaii reported that 716 dwellings were destroyed by lava.  By early August the eruption subsided substantially, and the last active lava was reported at the surface on September 4, 2018. On December 5, 2018, after 90 days of inactivity from the volcano, the eruption that began in 1983 was declared to have ended.",
