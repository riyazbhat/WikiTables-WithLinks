  "/wiki/Hawaii_Belt_Road": "The Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road is a modern name for the M\u0101malahoa Highway and consists of Hawai\u02bbi state Routes 11, 19, and 190 that encircle the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. The southern section, between Hilo and Kailua-Kona is numbered as Route 11. The section between Hilo and Waimea is Route 19. Between Waimea and Kailua-Kona, the road is split in two: the original mauka route (now Route 190) and a makai Route 19, completed in 1975, which serves as access to the Kona and Kohala Coast resorts. In the Hawaiian language, mauka means towards the mountain and makai means towards the sea. These terms are commonly used in travel directions.\n Parts of the southern half of the Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road were known during the Territorial days as the Ka\u02bb\u016b Belt Road. The names Hawai\u02bbi Belt Road and M\u0101malahoa Highway refer to the road system that encircles the entire island; many sections are also referenced by local names.",
  "/wiki/Hawaii_Volcanoes_National_Park": "Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park, established on August 1, 1916, is an American national park located in the U.S. state of Hawaii on the island of Hawaii. The park encompasses two active volcanoes: K\u012blauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa, the world's most massive shield volcano. The park provides scientists with insight into the birth and development of the Hawaiian Islands, and ongoing studies into the processes of volcanism. For visitors, the park offers dramatic volcanic landscapes, as well as glimpses of rare flora and fauna. In recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park was designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987. In 2012, the park was depicted on the 14th quarter of the America the Beautiful Quarters series. On May 11, 2018, the park was closed to the public in the K\u012blauea volcano summit area, including the visitor center and park headquarters, due to explosions and toxic ash clouds from Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu, as well as earthquakes and road damage. Portions of the park, including the visitor center, reopened to the public on September 22, 2018.",
  "/wiki/Ainahou_Ranch": "The Shipman family leased 6,324 acres (2,559 ha) of land near the K\u012blauea volcano in 1937 from the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, which they called the Ainahou Ranch. The name \u02bbaina hou means new land. An older ranch called Keauhou (not to be confused with the community of Keauhou, on the western side of the island) had been established here in 1921, so a primitive trail existed, and the Chain of Craters Road had recently been built within a few miles. Herbert C. Shipman built a house on the remote ranch in 1941 for the family as a refuge for the anticipated Japanese invasion of Hawaii. It was used as a working cattle ranch, raising beef for the military during World War II. After a tsunami in 1946 devastated the Puna Shipman property, killing half the endangered n\u0113n\u0113 he was raising there, he built pens at Ainahou to continue raising them. After the war, it was estimated only about 30 birds existed in the wild. Herbert Shipman reintroduced two pairs to the Pohakuloa Training Area, and worked with British ornithologist Peter Scott to expand the breeding program to England, possibly saving the species from extinction.",

The original road, built in 1928, connected Crater Rim Drive to Makaopuhi Crater. The road was lengthened to reach the tiny town of Kalapana in 1959. As of 2018, the road has had parts covered by lava in 41 of the past 53 years, due to eruptions of K\u012blauea volcano.",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries\u2014including all the great powers\u2014eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war. Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with China by 1937,[b] though neither side had declared war on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom.",
  "/wiki/Hawaiian_goose": "The nene (Branta sandvicensis or sandwicensis), also known as n\u0113n\u0113 and Hawaiian goose, is a species of bird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The official bird of the state of Hawai\u02bbi, the nene is exclusively found in the wild on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Kaua\u02bbi, Molokai, and Hawai\u02bbi. The Hawaiian name n\u0113n\u0113 comes from its soft call. The specific name sandvicensis refers to the Sandwich Islands, a former name for the Hawaiian Islands. It is thought that the nene evolved from the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), which most likely arrived on the Hawaiian islands about 500,000 years ago, shortly after the island of Hawai\u02bbi was formed. This ancestor is the progenitor of the nene as well as the prehistoric Giant Hawai\u02bbi goose(Branta rhuax) and n\u0113n\u0113-nui (Branta hylobadistes). The n\u0113n\u0113-nui was larger than the nene, varied from flightless to flighted depending on the individual, and inhabited the island of Maui. Similar fossil geese found on O\u02bbahu and Kaua\u02bbi may be of the same species.",

Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor and very fluid, and they tend to be non-explosive. Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000 years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000 years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000 years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which has been responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years.

The population was 43,263 according to the 2010 census. Hilo is the county seat of the County of Hawai\u02bbi and is in the District of South Hilo. The town overlooks Hilo Bay, at the base of two shield volcanoes, Mauna Loa, an active volcano, and Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano. Mauna Kea is the site of some of the world's most important ground-based astronomical observatories. Much of the city is at risk from lava flows from Mauna Loa, and the bayfront was twice destroyed by tsunamis. The majority of human settlement in Hilo stretches from Hilo Bay to Wai\u0101kea-Uka, on the flanks of the volcanoes.

Historically, K\u012blauea is the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawai\u02bbi. Located along the southeastern shore of the island, the volcano is between 210,000 and 280,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago. It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, K\u012blauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Structurally, K\u012blauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending 125 km (78 mi) east and the other 35 km (22 mi) west, as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20 mm (0.1 to 0.8 in) per year. K\u012blauea erupted nearly continuously from 1983 to 2018, causing considerable property damage, including the destruction of the towns of Kalapana and Kaim\u016b along with the renowned black sand beach, in 1990. During the 2018 lower Puna eruption, two dozen lava vents erupted downrift from the summit in Puna.",
