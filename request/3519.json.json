  "/wiki/Exchange_matrix": "In mathematics, especially linear algebra, the exchange matrix (also called the reversal matrix, backward identity, or standard involutory permutation) is a special case of a permutation matrix, where the 1 elements reside on the counterdiagonal and all other elements are zero. In other words, it is a 'row-reversed' or 'column-reversed' version of the identity matrix.",
  "/wiki/Binary_matrix": "A logical matrix, binary matrix, relation matrix, Boolean matrix, or (0,1) matrix is a matrix with entries from the Boolean domain B = {0, 1}.  Such a matrix can be used to represent a binary relation between a pair of finite sets.",
  "/wiki/Permutation_matrix": "In mathematics, particularly in matrix theory, a permutation matrix is a square binary matrix that has exactly one entry of 1 in each row and each column and 0s elsewhere. Each such matrix, say P, represents a  permutation of m elements and, when used to multiply another matrix, say A, results in  permuting the rows (when pre-multiplying, to form PA) or columns (when post-multiplying, to form AP) of the matrix A.",

  "/wiki/Identity_matrix": "In linear algebra, the identity matrix, or sometimes ambiguously called a unit matrix, of size n is the n \u00d7 n square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It is denoted by In, or simply by I if the size is immaterial or can be trivially determined by the context. (In some fields, such as quantum mechanics, the identity matrix is denoted by a boldface one, 1; otherwise it is identical to I.) Less frequently, some mathematics books use U or E to represent the identity matrix, meaning \"unit matrix\" and the German word Einheitsmatrix respectively.",

There are three ways to achieve this: as either an upper-triangular matrix, a lower-triangular matrix (triangular matrices), or a symmetric matrix. The 5\u00d75 truncations of these are shown below.",
  "/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle": "In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in India, Persia (Iran), China, Germany, and Italy.",
