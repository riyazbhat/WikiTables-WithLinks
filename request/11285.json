The capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the Roman Empire, a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years. The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear. It was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe.

  "/wiki/Sultan": "Sultan (/\u02c8s\u028clt\u0259n/; Arabic: \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 sul\u1e6d\u0101n, pronounced [s\u028al\u02c8t\u02e4\u0251\u02d0n, sol\u02c8t\u02e4\u0251\u02d0n]) is a position with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning strength, authority, rulership, derived from the verbal noun \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 sul\u1e6dah, meaning authority or power (cognate with the Hebrew word Shilton \u05e9\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05df which retained that meaning to the present). Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjective form of the word is sultanic, and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate (\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u0629 sal\u1e6danah). The term is distinct from king (\u0645\u0644\u0643 malik), despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. The use of sultan is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular king, which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. In recent years, sultan has been gradually replaced by king by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957.",
