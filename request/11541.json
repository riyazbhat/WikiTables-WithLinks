  "/wiki/Mid-levels": "Mid-Levels (Chinese: \u534a\u5c71\u5340; Sidney Lau: boon3 saan1 kui1; literally: 'mid mountain area') is an affluent residential area on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. It is located between Victoria Peak and Central. Residents are predominantly more affluent Hong Kong locals and expatriate professionals. The Mid-Levels is further divided into four areas: Mid-Levels West (near Central, Sheung Wan and Sai Wan including Bonham Road, Caine Road, and Conduit Road, stretching from University of Hong Kong in the west to Garden Road in the east), Mid-Levels Central (near Admiralty and Wan Chai, including Macdonnell Road, Kennedy Road and Bowen Road), stretching from Garden Road in the west to Happy Valley in the east), Mid-Levels East (near Causeway Bay, including Jardine's Lookout and Mount Butler), and Mid-Levels North (near North Point including Braemar Hill). Aside from the panoramic view of Victoria Harbour or the rest of the city or both, it is also close to Central and Admiralty, which are both significant business areas, thus providing easy and convenient access for the business people living in Mid-Levels. An added attraction of the Mid-Levels is its close proximity to nature and comparatively better air quality than many parts of the Hong Kong Island. Many wealthy people in Hong Kong are willing to pay higher residential property price for a residence that is away from pollution and yet remain so close to the centre of the city. Many streets are named after former Governors of Hong Kong.",
