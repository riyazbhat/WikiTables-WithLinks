  "/wiki/F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet": "The Boeing F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet are twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft variants based on the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced derivatives of the F/A-18C and D Hornet. The Super Hornet has an internal 20 mm M61 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface weapons. Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external air refueling system. Designed and initially produced by McDonnell Douglas, the Super Hornet first flew in 1995. Low-rate production began in early 1997 with full-rate production starting in September 1997, after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing the previous month. The Super Hornet entered service with the United States Navy in 2001, replacing the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which was retired in 2006; the Super Hornet serves alongside the original Hornet. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which has operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984, ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging F-111C fleet.",

  "/wiki/E-2_Hawkeye": "The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather, carrier-capable tactical airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft. This twin-turboprop aircraft was designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy as a replacement for the earlier, piston-engined E-1 Tracer, which was rapidly becoming obsolete. The aircraft's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B, and E-2C versions, where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics. The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D, which first flew in 2007. The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role, as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe, such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry. Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960, giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft. The E-2 also received the nickname Super Fudd because it replaced the WF (later E-1) Willy Fudd. In recent decades, the E-2 has been commonly referred to as the Hummer because of the distinctive sounds of its turboprop engines, quite unlike that of turbojet and turbofan jet engines.",

On January 15, 2013, HSL-42 was re-designated HSM-72 and relocated to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, reflecting the squadron\u2019s shift from the SH-60B to the MH-60R, and departure from the expeditionary construct, entering the world of Carrier Air Wing operations. In 2013, Proud Warriors were assigned to Carrier Air Wing SEVEN (CVW-7) and departed on their maiden Carrier Air Wing deployment in November 2015, with Carrier Strike Group EIGHT (CSG-8). In November 2016, HSM-72 transitioned to Carrier Air Wing ONE (CVW-1), remaining in CSG-8 and deployed in support of the USS HARRY S TRUMAN Carrier Strike Group tasking, executing Department of the Navy\u2019s inaugural Dynamic Force Employment operations to the U.S. SECOND and SIXTH Fleet in 2018, with a follow-on deployment in 2019 to the U.S. SIXTH and FIFTH Fleet Areas of Responsibility. In the Carrier Air Wing construct, Proud Warriors are dispersed between the Carrier Element embarked the nuclear aircraft carrier, and three Combat Elements embarked the three Strike Group escort ships. In support of Carrier Strike Group, Combined and Joint Task Forces, United Nations, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations, the MH-60R is utilized to execute the primary mission sets of surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare, command and control, and non-combat operations. During an illustrious history, Proud Warriors have conducted deployed operations across the globe, from South America, to the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean, throughout the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, off the Horn of Africa, and to the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf."
