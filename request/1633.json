The reservoir was named after Lake Caniapiscau that was flooded in 1981 during the formation of the reservoir. The name comes from the Cree or Innu term kaniapiskau or kaneapiskak which means rocky point or place where there is a rocky point. Albert Peter Low had noted in 1895 that a high rocky headland jutts into the lake. He probably referred to the northwest facing peninsula that gives the reservoir the shape of an arc as we know it now. In the 19th century, Lake Caniapiscau was frequented by hunters and fur traders. In 1834, the Hudson's Bay Company opened there an outpost to link its facilities in the James Bay region with those of Ungava Bay. The Kaniapiskau Post closed its doors in 1870.",
