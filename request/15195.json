  "/wiki/Weird_Tales": "Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom would go on to be popular writers, but within a year the magazine was in financial trouble.  Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger and refinanced Weird Tales, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor.  The first issue under Wright's control was dated November 1924.  The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks it prospered over the next fifteen years.  Under Wright's control the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \"The Unique Magazine\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction.",
