Canada's climate varies widely across its vast area, ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.

Managed for most of its history by Al Leader, it was originally the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL), which had absorbed three teams from the Western Canada Senior Hockey League for the 1951-1952 season before renaming itself one year later. During the 1960s, the WHL moved into a number of large west coast markets including Los Angeles and San Francisco. There was speculation that the WHL could grow into a major league capable of rivalling even the long-entrenched National Hockey League. In the 1965\u201366 and 1967\u201368 seasons, the WHL played an interlocking schedule with the American Hockey League. Fears that the WHL (or a WHL/AHL merger) could become a rival major league was among the factors that finally convinced the National Hockey League to expand for the 1967\u201368 season. Several factors led to the WHL's decision to cease operations after the 1973\u201374 season. The NHL and World Hockey Association had moved into many of its traditional markets, and the talent pool had become strained by the fast growth in the number of professional teams.",
