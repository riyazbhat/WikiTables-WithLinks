  "/wiki/Nelson_complexity_index": "The Nelson complexity index (NCI) is a measure to compare the secondary conversion capacity of a petroleum refinery with the primary distillation capacity.  The index provides an easy metric for quantifying and ranking the complexity of various refineries and units. To calculate the index, it is necessary to use complexity factors, which compare the cost of upgrading units to the cost of crude distillation unit.",
  "/wiki/Barrel_(unit)": "A barrel is one of several units of volume applied in various contexts; there are dry barrels, fluid barrels (such as the U.K. beer barrel and U.S. beer barrel), oil barrels and so forth. For historical reasons the volumes of some barrel units are roughly double the volumes of others; volumes in common usage range approximately from 100 to 200 litres (22 to 44\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 26 to 53\u00a0US\u00a0gal). In many connections the term \"drum\" is used almost interchangeably with \"barrel\".\n Since medieval times the term barrel as a unit of measure has had various meanings throughout Europe, ranging from about 100 litres to about 1000 litres. The name was derived in medieval times from the French baril, of unknown origin, but still in use, both in French and as derivations in many other languages such as Italian, Polish and Spanish. In most countries such usage is obsolescent, increasingly superseded by SI units. As a result, the meaning of corresponding words and related concepts (vat, cask, keg etc.) in other languages often refers to a physical container rather than a known measure.\n In the international oil market context, however, prices in United States dollars per barrel are commonly used, and the term is variously translated, often to derivations of the Latin/Teutonic root fat (for example vat or Fass).\n In other commercial connections, barrel sizes such as beer keg volumes also are standardised in many countries.",
  "/wiki/Wood_River_Refinery": "The Wood River Refinery is an oil refinery located in Roxana, Illinois, approximately 15 miles (24\u00a0km) north of St. Louis, Missouri, on the east side of the Mississippi River. The refinery is currently owned by Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy and operated by the joint-venture company WRB Refining, LLC (WRB).  WRB was formed on 1 July 2007, with Encana taking a 49% interest in Wood River and also Phillips 66's Borger refinery. Encana subsequently spun off oil sands producer Cenovus and ConocoPhillips spun off Phillips 66.  In return for a 49% stake in the refinery, ConocoPhillips gained a joint interest in two Alberta oil sands (bitumen) heavy oil projects: Christina Lake (Alberta) and Foster Creek. ConocoPhillips\u2019 interest was sold to Cenovus in May 2017, leaving Cenovus the sole owner and operator of the assets. Cenovus uses SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage) technology at those sites.\n The complex is capable of refining 380,000 barrels (60,000\u00a0m3) of crude oil per day and is the largest refinery operated by Phillips 66. Oil is supplied from the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and domestic sources through pipelines. The facility produces 165,000 barrels per day (26,200\u00a0m3/d) of gasoline, 90,000 barrels per day (14,000\u00a0m3/d) of diesel and jet fuels, as well as other products including asphalt, propane, and chemical feedstocks.\n A new four-drum coker, part of Wood River Refinery's Coker and Refinery Expansion (CORE) was completed in November 2011. The new coker has a capacity of 75,000 barrels per day and is expected to expand the capacity to handle the bitumen from the Alberta oil sands by nearly 700%. The new Wood River coker's processing capacity is approximately 200,000 - 220,000 barrels per day. The CORE project took about three years to build, with a total cost of US $3.8 billion (US $1.9 billion to Cenovus), and has increased clean product yield by 5% to approximately 85%. While the expansion was undertaken specifically to handle heavy oil imported from Alberta, the refined transportation fuels products are destined for the U.S. Midwest market, including St. Louis and Chicago not Canada.\n An RO filtration system upgrade to treat boiler water was also completed in 2011. 3500 total feet of pipe on 800 feet of modular pipe rack was installed along movable trailers containing the filtration system. This expansion increased the amount of steam available to the refinery.  Thermal cracking, stripping and power generation are some of the major processes within a refinery that use steam.\n Wood River Refinery was originally built by Shell in 1917.  In the late 1990s, Shell and Texaco merged their downstream segments to form the Motiva (with Saudi national oil company Saudi ARAMCO) and Equilon joint ventures.  During a prolonged period of low refining profit margins, Equilon sold the refinery to Tosco in 2003.  Shortly thereafter, Phillips Petroleum acquired Tosco.  When Conoco and Phillips merged, the refinery became an asset of ConocoPhillips.  Multiple ownership of refineries is not uncommon in the United States, where many refineries (in original form) predate World War II.",

Located in Linden and Elizabeth, New Jersey, and bisected by Morses Creek, it is the northernmost refinery on the East Coast of the United States. The oil refinery converts crude oil (supplied by tanker ships from the North Sea, Canada and West Africa and by rail from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota) into gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, propane and heating oil. As of 2007, the facility processed approximately 238,000\u00a0bbl/d (37,800\u00a0m3/d) of crude oil, producing 145,000\u00a0bbl/d (23,100\u00a0m3/d) of gasoline and 110,000\u00a0bbl/d (17,000\u00a0m3/d) of distillates. Its products are delivered to East Coast customers via pipeline transport, barges, railcars and tank trucks.\n The facility also houses a petrochemical plant which produces lubricants and additives and a polypropylene plant that produces over 775 million pounds of polypropylene per year.  The refinery has its own railway container terminal and heliport.\n The workers at the plant have been unionized under the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Local No. 877) since 1960.\n The refinery has had and continues to have environmental issues, culminating in the major $225 million Exxon Mobil-New Jersey Environmental Contamination settlement. A 2010 investigative report conducted by WABC-TV, the ABC flagship station in New York City, characterizes the Bayway Refinery as a \"repeat offender\" of environmental regulations.",

The plant is located in the Cherry Point Industrial Zone, west of Ferndale, WA. Its secondary processing facilities include a fluid catalytic cracker, an alkylation unit, hydotreating units and a naphtha reformer. The plant follows a 10-5-3-2 crack spread, meaning that for 10 barrels of crude feedstock the refinery produces 5 barrels of gasoline, 3 barrels of distillate and 2 barrels of fuel oil.\n The Ferndale Refinery was the first of five currently operating in Washington state, built by General Petroleum Corp in 1954. The original capacity was rated at 35,000 barrels per stream day. General Petroleum was a subsidiary of Socony (Standard Oil Company of New York) and was integrated into Mobil Chemical Co when the company formed in 1960.\n BP took control of the refinery in 1988 when its wholly owned subsidiary, Sohio, received the plant from Mobil Oil in exchange for $152.5 million and crude oil inventories.\n In 1993, Tosco Corp, a California-based downstream and marketing corporation, bought the refinery from BP. The deal included BP\u2019s retail stations and marketing assets across Washington and Oregon. BP left the Northwest refining market only five years after entry.\n Phillips Petroleum Company purchased Tosco for $7 billion in February 2001, and assumed control of the refinery thereafter. With the deal\u2019s close, Phillips became the second largest refiner in the U.S. and obtained refineries on both coasts. Even after the Tosco purchase, Phillips sought further expansion. Phillips and Conoco Inc announced a merger in November 2001, forming ConocoPhillips, the new controlling entity of the Ferndale Refinery. This new supermajor boasted the nation's largest downstream system (as of 2001). In 2012 ConocoPhillips spun off its downstream and midstream assets as a new independent energy company, Phillips 66, which still operates the Ferndale Refinery. ConocoPhillips became the second company to abandon the vertically integrated model, following Marathon Oil Corporation\u2019s decision to spin off its downstream assets in 2011.\n The Ferndale refinery receives a portion of its crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America, a concern of many environmentalists.
