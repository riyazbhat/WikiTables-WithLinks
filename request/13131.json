  "/wiki/9_to_5_(Sheena_Easton_song)": "9 to 5 (or Morning Train) is the title of a popular song written by British songwriter Florrie Palmer and recorded by Sheena Easton in 1980, becoming her biggest hit. It peaked at number three in the United Kingdom in August 1980 and was certified gold. It was released in the United States and Canada under the title Morning Train (9 to 5) to avoid confusion with Dolly Parton's recent hit 9 to 5) in February 1981. It reached number one in both countries, becoming Easton's only chart-topper in those nations. Easton had released one single prior to 9 to 5: Modern Girl. This had failed to chart highly, but after exposure on the BBC documentary, The Big Time, Pop Singer, both 9 to 5 and Modern Girl were propelled into the top ten at the same time, making her the second female artist (after Ruby Murray) to achieve this feat. 9 to 5 became a top three hit and was one of the best-selling singles of the year. Early in 1981, EMI Records decided to launch Easton in the US and released 9 to 5 as her debut single. The title of the song was changed to Morning Train (Nine to Five) to avoid confusion with the Dolly Parton song of the same name, which charted nearly simultaneously with Easton's record. Easton's song went to #1 on both the U.S. pop and adult contemporary charts; it remained at the top for two weeks on Billboard's pop chart. On Billboard's 1981 year-end charts, it came in as the twelfth-biggest pop and thirteenth-biggest AC hit of the year 1981. It also topped the RPM magazine pop and AC charts in Canada, reigning over the former for two weeks in May 1981, while also reaching the summit in New Zealand, before being replaced by Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart.",

The song was accompanied by a music video that featured footage of Parton and her band performing, intercut with clips from the film.",

It was recorded in London at Master Rock studios late 1992 and early 1993 and was produced by Ed Buller. At the time the fastest-selling debut album in British history in almost a decade, Suede debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, won the 1993 Mercury Music Prize, and is often cited as one of the first Britpop records. Displaying a sound of Britishness and glam rock, its music and lyrical content has been compared to The Smiths and early David Bowie. The album was preceded by what Rolling Stone called its triptych of instantly classic singles. The three singles, The Drowners, Metal Mickey and Animal Nitrate helped to create a media buzz leading to significant hype for a year leading up to the album's release. It was met with generally favourable reviews both in the UK and in the US. Although it remains the group's biggest-selling album in the US, it struggled to make headway commercially compared to the success in the UK.

In 1992, Suede were dubbed by Melody Maker as The Best New Band in Britain, and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album Suede went to the top of the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster 'Britpop' as a musical movement, though the band distanced themselves from the term. The recording sessions for their second album, Dog Man Star, were fraught with difficulty and ended with original guitarist Bernard Butler departing after confrontations with the other members. The album was completed without Butler, and the band toured the record with replacement Richard Oakes. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has over time been lauded as one of rock music's great albums. In 1994, Suede would become a component of the Britpop big four, along with Oasis, Blur and Pulp. In 1996, following the recruitment of keyboard player Neil Codling, Suede went on to greater commercial success with Coming Up. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide.

  "/wiki/Impossible_Princess": "Impossible Princess (retitled Kylie Minogue in Europe for a temporary period) is the sixth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It was first released in Japan by BMG on 22 October 1997, and distributed worldwide by Mushroom and Deconstruction months later. The singer asserted partial creative control over the project - taking part as a co-producer and composer to the material - and was assisted by various musicians and producers, namely Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan. Sonically, Impossible Princess is a departure from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence from the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiment with cultural elements like Middle Eastern and Celtic music. Lyrically, the album's central focus is Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips around Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the freedom of expression, relationships and emotions. Upon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided by regions, particularly between the UK, and throughout Australasia and the Americas. In retrospect, the record has achieved critical acclaim for its status as an underrated release, and was highlighted for Minogue's creative input and mixture of genres. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland and the United Kingdom, and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 70,000 units; however, its lack of success in Europe was further scrutinised by the British media. Five singles were released from the album: Some Kind of Bliss, Did It Again, Breathe, Too Far (only as promotional single), and Cowboy Style, all of which experienced moderate success. After a small promotional tour in 1997, Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in Australia and the UK the following year, which was a commercial and critical success.",
  "/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales": "In the early hours of 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales died in a hospital after being injured in a car crash in a road tunnel in Paris, France. Her partner, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. Their bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, survived with serious injuries. Media blamed the erratic behaviour of paparazzi following the car, as reported by the BBC contributed to the crash. In 1999, a French investigation found that Paul, who lost control of the vehicle at high speed while intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs, was solely responsible for the crash. He was the deputy head of security at the H\u00f4tel Ritz and had earlier goaded paparazzi waiting for Diana and Fayed outside the hotel. Anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his blood may have worsened Paul's inebriation. No evidence was found that paparazzi were near the car when it crashed. In 2008, the jury at a British inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving by Paul and following vehicles. It was also found that none of the occupants of the car was wearing a seat belt. Diana was 36 years old when she died.
