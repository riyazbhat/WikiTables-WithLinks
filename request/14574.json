The motto of Glenrothes is Ex terra vis, meaning From the earth strength, which dates back to the founding of the town. Planned in the late 1940s as one of Scotland's first post-second world war new towns, its original purpose was to house miners who were to work at a newly established coal mine, the Rothes Colliery.
