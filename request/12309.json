  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12\u201312.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, ductility, or machinability.",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. The word \"granite\" comes from the Latin granum, a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. Strictly speaking, granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume, and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar, although commonly the term \"granite\" is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar.",
  "/wiki/Crown_Hill_Cemetery": "Crown Hill Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery located at 700 West Thirty-Eighth Street in Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana. The privately owned cemetery was established in 1863 at Strawberry Hill, whose summit was renamed \"The Crown\", a high point overlooking Indianapolis. It is approximately 2.8 miles (4.5\u00a0km) northwest of the city's center. Crown Hill was dedicated on June 1, 1864, and encompasses 555 acres (225\u00a0ha), making it the third largest non-governmental cemetery in the United States. Its grounds are based on the landscape designs of Pittsburgh landscape architect and cemetery superintendent John Chislett Sr. and Adolph Strauch, a Prussian horticulturalist. In 1866 the U.S. government authorized a U.S. National Cemetery for Indianapolis. The 1.4-acre (0.57\u00a0ha) Crown Hill National Cemetery is located in Section 10.",
  "/wiki/Marble": "Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite. Marble is typically not foliated, although there are exceptions. In geology, the term \"marble\" refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone. Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.",
  "/wiki/Limestone": "Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, foraminifera, and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). A closely related rock is dolomite, which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2. In old USGS publications, dolomite was referred to as magnesian limestone, a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones.",
  "/wiki/Eastman_Monument": "The Eastman Monument is a public artwork by an unknown artist, located at Crown Hill National Cemetery, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America. It is a monument with a white marble angel standing against a granite cross that is standing upon three steps. The angel is dressed in a cloth gown and stands with its hands spread out and its head turned down to the ground. The first step has \"EASTMAN\" written across it.",
  "/wiki/Hildebrand_Monument": "The Hildebrand Monument is a public artwork fabricated by Joyce & Diener and located at Crown Hill National Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. The monument marks the graves of Henry W. Hildebrand and his three children, William H., Louisa E., and George H. Hildebrand. It features an eighteen-foot column mounted on a rectangular base made of granite with a cornice that is peaked and a tiered bottom section. On top of the cornice is a full-sized statue of Henry W. Hildebrand (c. 1836-1876) wearing a frockcoat. In his left hand is an anchor and his right hand is upraised in the air. Behind him is a tree stump.",
  "/wiki/Holcomb_Mausoleum_Door": "Holcomb Mausoleum Door is a public artwork by American fabricator Amick & Wearley Monuments, located in  Crown Hill Cemetery, which is near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Holcomb Mausoleum Door is bronze and glass and is approximately 78 x 39 x 4\u00a0inches. The door features a full-length female figure, seen from behind. The figure is portrayed wearing a draping dress, with the proper left shoulder bare. The background of the door consists of stalks, also in bronze, with the figure's proper right hand raised toward the stalks, and her proper left hand placed on the door handle. The figure is looking downward, over her right shoulder.",
  "/wiki/Glass": "Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics. Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form, some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring.  The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are \"silicate glasses\" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand.  Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, account for around 90% of manufactured glass. The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology. Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material.",
