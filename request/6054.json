It emerged from the popular op\u00e9ras comiques en vaudevilles of the Fair Theatres of St Germain and St Laurent (and to a lesser extent the Com\u00e9die-Italienne), which combined existing popular tunes with spoken sections. Associated with the Paris theatre of the same name, op\u00e9ra comique is not always comic or light in nature; Carmen, perhaps the most famous op\u00e9ra comique, is a tragedy.",

In 1762 the company was merged with, and for a time took the name of its chief rival the Com\u00e9die-Italienne at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, and was also called the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien up to about 1793, when it again became most commonly known as the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Today the company's official name is Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique, and its theatre, with a capacity of around 1,248 seats, sometimes referred to as the Salle Favart (the third on this site), is located in Place Bo\u00efeldieu, in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Palais Garnier, one of the theatres of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. The musicians and others associated with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique have made important contributions to operatic history and tradition in France, and to French opera. Its current mission is to reconnect with its history, and discover its unique repertoire, to ensure production and dissemination of operas for the wider public. Mainstays of the repertory at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique during its history have included the following works which have each been performed more than 1,000 times by the company: Cavalleria Rusticana, Le chalet, La dame blanche, Le domino noir, La fille du r\u00e9giment, Lakm\u00e9, Manon, Mignon, Les noces de Jeannette, Le pr\u00e9 aux clercs, Tosca, La boh\u00e8me, Werther and Carmen, the last having been performed more than 2,500 times.",
