As the former Abbey National Building Society, it was the first building society in the United Kingdom to demutualise, doing so in July 1989.

Abbey National launched an online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000. In September 2003, the bank rebranded as Abbey, and in November 2004, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group, with a rebrand following in February 2005. In January 2010, the savings business of Bradford & Bingley was combined with the bank, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc.
