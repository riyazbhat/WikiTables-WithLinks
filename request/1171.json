  "/wiki/Extreme_Makeover:_Home_Edition": "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition (EM:HE; sometimes informally referred to as Extreme Home Makeover) is an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools. The original run of the show on ABC was hosted by former model, carpenter and television personality Ty Pennington. Each episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life-threatening illness, in need of new hope. The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation (paid for by the show's producers) and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely. The show's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it. The materials and labor are donated. Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house. EM:HE is considered a spin-off of Extreme Makeover, an earlier series providing personal makeovers (often including plastic surgery) to selected individuals. Unusual for a spin-off, Home Edition outlasted its mother show by several seasons. This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone's space.",
