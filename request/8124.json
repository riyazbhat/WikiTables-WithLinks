The cycle consists of four r\u00edmur, the first in stafhent and the rest in ferskeytt meter. The r\u00edmur are preserved in only one medieval manuscript, Sta\u00f0arh\u00f3lsb\u00f3k.",

Ukko is held the most significant god of Finnish mythology, although it is disputed by scholars whether this is accountable to later Christian influence. In the folk poems and prayers he is also given the epithet Ylijumala (English: Supreme God), probably in reference to his status as the most highly regarded god and on the other hand his traditional domain in the heavens. Other names for Ukko include Pitk\u00e4nen (pitk\u00e4, \"long\"), Is\u00e4inen (is\u00e4, \"father\"), Isoinen (iso, archaic form of the above, modern meaning \"great\", \"big\" or \"large\"). Although portrayed active in myth, Ukko makes all his appearances in legend solely by natural phenomena when appealed to. According to Martti Haavio, the name Ukko was sometimes used as a common noun or generalised epithet for multiple deities instead of denoting a specific god.",
