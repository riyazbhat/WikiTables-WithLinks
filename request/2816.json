Abdullajanov was detained at Boryspil International Airport (near Ukrainian capital Kiev) on the request of the Tajik authorities upon arriving from Los Angeles on 5 February 2013.

Abdullajanov was also charged with organizing a riot in the Sughd Province which claimed dozens of lives in 1998. Abdullajanov has denied any involvement in his interviews to Western media. On 4 April 2013 Ukraine  freed Abdullajanov from detention and refused a request to extradite him to his homeland.\n Rumors have circulated that \"Abdullajanov would support an opposition candidate who has not yet declared his participation\" in the November 2013 Tajikistani presidential election, but because Abdullajanov has not been interviewed for a long time his stand on the issue is unclear.",
