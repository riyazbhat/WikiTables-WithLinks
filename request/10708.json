  "/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race": "The Sunday Times Golden Globe Race was a non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world yacht race, held in 1968\u20131969, and was the first round-the-world yacht race. The race was controversial due to the failure of most competitors to finish the race and because of the suicide of one entrant; however, it ultimately led to the founding of the BOC Challenge and Vend\u00e9e Globe round-the-world races, both of which continue to be successful and popular.\n The race was sponsored by the British Sunday Times newspaper and was designed to capitalise on a number of individual round-the-world voyages which were already being planned by various sailors; for this reason, there were no qualification requirements, and competitors were offered the opportunity to join and permitted to start at any time between 1 June and 31 October 1968. The Golden Globe trophy was offered to the first person to complete an unassisted, non-stop single-handed circumnavigation of the world via the great capes, and a separate \u00a35,000 prize was offered for the fastest single-handed circumnavigation.\n Nine sailors started the race; four retired before leaving the Atlantic Ocean. Of the five remaining, Chay Blyth, who had set off with absolutely no sailing experience, sailed past the Cape of Good Hope before retiring; Nigel Tetley sank with 1,100 nautical miles (2,000\u00a0km) to go while leading; Donald Crowhurst, who, in desperation, attempted to fake a round-the-world voyage to avoid financial ruin, began to show signs of mental illness, and then committed suicide; and Bernard Moitessier, who rejected the philosophy behind a commercialised competition, abandoned the race while in a strong position to win and kept sailing non-stop until he reached Tahiti after circling the globe one and a half times.  Robin Knox-Johnston was the only entrant to complete the race, becoming the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world.  He was awarded both prizes, and later donated the \u00a35,000 to a fund supporting Crowhurst's family.",

  "/wiki/Around_the_world_sailing_record": "The first around the world sailing record for circumnavigation of the world was Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano and the remaining members of Ferdinand Magellan's crew who completed their journey in 1522. The first solo record was set by Joshua Slocum in the Spray (1898).\n The current record holders are IDEC 3, skippered by Francis Joyon in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds for a crewed journey, and Fran\u00e7ois Gabart with Macif in 42 days, 16 hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds for a solo journey.\n Most races or solo attempts start from Europe. Due to the configuration of the continents, sailing around the world consists of sailing on the Southern Ocean around the Antarctica continent, passing south of Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope and Cape Leeuwin. Since 1918 the Panama Canal is an option but the locks must be entered and exited using engine power. Large stretches of the canal can be crossed under sail power.\n Sailing around the world can be done by two directions: eastward or westward. The dominant winds and currents (outside tropical areas) make the voyage eastwards on the Southern hemisphere faster, most skippers and yachts who race prefer this route. Today, the multihulls perform much better than monohulls and hold the best times. Leisure yacht skippers who prefer tropical seas more often go westward, using the trade winds (and the Panama canal).\nThe Jules Verne Trophy is awarded to the skipper who breaks the outright record, starting from an imaginary line between the Cr\u00e9ac'h lighthouse on Ouessant (Ushant) Island, France, and the Lizard Lighthouse, UK.\n The records are homologated by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC).\n According to the WSSRC, for around the world sailing records, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600\u00a0nmi calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63\u00b0S. The great-circle distance formulas are to be used, assuming that the great circle length is 21,600\u00a0nmi. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track. The equator must be crossed. In reality, this means that the boat should pass a waypoint at or not far from the antipode of the starting port of the journey (the exact position depends on how short the shortest possible track is). For example, the Vend\u00e9e Globe starts at 46\u00b0N 2\u00b0W, has a waypoint at 57\u00b0S 180\u00b0E, and barely makes the distance requirement. The participants don't have to go to the antipode at 46\u00b0S 178\u00b0E since the rounding of Africa gives extra distance."
