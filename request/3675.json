  "/wiki/Crow_Creek_Water_Ditch": "The Crow Creek Water Ditch is a historic water transportation system which brought water from Eureka Creek to where it was needed in gold placer mining in the Indian Creek drainage area where gold was discovered in 1866. It is located near Townsend, Montana. It was built between 1866 and c.1875 originally to support gold mining, which required water, then later was used for farm and ranch irrigation. Over its 11 miles (18 km) length it dropped from 6,300 feet (1,900 m) to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) elevation. Along most of its length, in two sections, it was a hand-dug ditch about 3 feet (0.91 m) wide and 1 foot (0.30 m) deep that was dug using shovels, picks and axes. One section was a spectacular 1,578 feet (481 m) wooden flume which brought it along walls of Hassel Canyon. It also included a 3 miles (4.8 km) section where it ran down natural gullies where no digging was needed. An approximately 8 miles (13 km) portion of it--the two hand-dug sections--was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The listed area also includes remnants of a wooden flume, and a rubble stone dam. In 1918 the Crow Creek Irrigation District was formed by farmers and ranchers for irrigation. With the creation of Canyon Ferry Lake the need for the canals decreased.",
  "/wiki/Helena_National_Forest": "Helena National Forest is located in west-central Montana, in the United States. Covering 984,558 acres (3,984.36 km2), the forest is broken into several separate sections. The eastern regions are dominated by the Big Belt Mountains, and are the location of the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness, which remains much as it did when the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the region. The western sections have both the continental divide and the Scapegoat Wilderness area, which is part of the Bob Marshall Wilderness complex. The southern region includes the Elkhorn Mountains. The forest is composed of a mixture of grass and sagebrush covered lowlands with island pockets of lodgepole pine and more mountainous areas where Douglas fir, spruce and larch can be found. The rocky mountains in the region do not exceed 10,000 feet (3,000 m).",

  "/wiki/Eagle_Guard_Station": "The Eagle Guard Station is a site on the National Register of Historic Places located about 11 miles west of Townsend, Montana. It was added to the Register on September 20, 2001. Eagle Creek Ranger Station was originally built by Richard (Dick) Owen and Jack Wilson in 1895. In 1905, the Elkhorn Forest Reserve was formed and between this date and the forming of the Helena National Forest in 1908, the Eagle Cabin was taken over by the U.S. Forest Service for administrative use. Eagle, Tizer and Glendale stations were all tied together by a telephone line that went into a switchboard at the store in Radersburg. The cabin is the oldest administrative log structure on the Helena National Forest and, in fact, predates the establishment of the Forest. Eagle was used by the Forest Service on a regular basis until the early 1950s. Riders from the Crow and Indian Creek Livestock Association used the cabin over the years up until the 1970s. Eagle Cabin is the oldest administrative log structure on the Helena National Forest.",

It was added to the Register on November 5, 1998. Originally a Catholic church, the building is now a museum known as Canton Church Historic Site. The church was built during 1875-76. According to its NRHP nomination, it is the oldest extant example of secular Roman Catholic church architecture in Montana. It is also a rare example of Colonial Style architecture. The addition of a belfry and steeple in 1902 somewhat altered the church's Colonial appearance, but still carried forward its earlier design features.

  "/wiki/Missouri_River": "The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles (3,767 km) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river drains a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles (1,300,000 km2), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi, the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system. For over 12,000 years, people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed, most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains. The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century, and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century. The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails. Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s, first by covered wagon, then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river. Settlers took over former Native American lands in the watershed, leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history.",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_287": "U.S. Route 287 (US 287) is a north-south (physically northwest-southeast) United States highway. It is 1,791 miles (2,882 km) long.

The highway's northern terminus is in Choteau, Montana, 100 miles (160.9 km) south of the Canadian border, at an intersection with US 89. Its southern terminus (as well as those of US 69 and US 96) is in Port Arthur, Texas at an intersection with State Highway 87 (SH 87), five miles (8.0 km) up the Sabine River from the Gulf of Mexico. It intersects its parent route US 87 twice, overlapping it from Amarillo to Dumas, Texas, and then crossing it in Denver, Colorado. US 287 is the shortest route between Denver and Dallas-Fort Worth.",
