  "/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting": "Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates.  Instead of indicating support for only one candidate, voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice.  If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that candidate wins. If not, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head. Compared to plurality voting, IRV can reduce the effect of vote-splitting when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters.\n Instant-runoff voting is used in national elections in several countries. For example, it is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives and at least one house of all Australian state parliaments; the President of India and members of legislative councils in India; the President of Ireland; members of Congress in Maine in the United States; and the Parliament in Papua New Guinea. The method is also used in local elections around the world, including New York City offices starting in 2021. It is used by many political parties (to elect internal leaders) and private associations, for various voting purposes such as that for choosing the Academy Award for Best Picture. IRV is described in Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised as an example of preferential voting.\n IRV is also sometimes referred to as the alternative vote, preferential voting, or ranked-choice voting (RCV), though these names are also used for other systems.  IRV can also be considered to be a single-winner variant of the single transferable vote system.",
  "/wiki/Aspen,_CO": "Aspen is the home rule municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Pitkin County, Colorado, United States. Its population was 6,658 at the 2010 United States Census.  Aspen is in a remote area of the Rocky Mountains' Sawatch Range and Elk Mountains, along the Roaring Fork River at an elevation just below 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above sea level on the Western Slope, 11 miles (18 km) west of the Continental Divide.\n Founded as a mining camp during the Colorado Silver Boom and later named \"Aspen\" because of the abundance of aspen trees in the area, the city boomed during the 1880s, its first decade of existence. The boom ended when the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse in the silver market, and the city began a half-century known as \"the quiet years\" during which its population steadily declined, reaching a nadir of fewer than a thousand by 1930. Aspen's fortunes reversed in the mid-20th century when neighboring Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort, and industrialist Walter Paepcke bought many properties in the city in the 1950s and redeveloped them. Today it is home to three institutions, two of which Paepcke helped found, that have international importance: the Aspen Music Festival and School, the Aspen Institute, and the Aspen Center for Physics.\n In the late 20th century, the city became a popular retreat for celebrities. Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson worked out of a downtown hotel and ran unsuccessfully for county sheriff. Singer John Denver wrote two songs about Aspen after settling there. Both of them popularized Aspen among the counter-cultural youth of the 1970s as an ideal place to live, and the city continued to grow even as it gained notoriety for some of the era's hedonistic excesses (particularly its drug culture).[citation needed]\n Aspen has some of the most expensive real estate in the United States. It remains a popular tourist destination, with outdoor recreation in the surrounding White River National Forest serving as a summertime complement to the four ski areas in the vicinity.",

  "/wiki/Single_transferable_vote": "The single transferable vote (STV) is a proportional voting system designed to achieve or closely approach proportional representation through voters ranking candidates in multi-seat organizations or constituencies (voting districts). There are various ways of counting votes under STV, as described below.\n Under STV, each elector (voter) gets a single vote in an election electing multiple winners. Each elector marks their ballot for the most preferred candidate and also marks back-up preferences. The vote goes to the voter's first preference if possible, but if their first preference is eliminated, instead of being thrown away, the vote is transferred to a back-up preference, with the vote being assigned to the voter's second, third, or lower choice or being apportioned fractionally to different candidates. \n The counting process works thus: votes are totalled, and a quota (the minimum number of votes required to win a seat) is derived.[note 1] If the elector's first-ranked candidate achieves the quota, the candidate is declared elected; and, in some STV systems, any surplus vote is transferred to other candidates in proportion to the next back-up preference marked on the ballots. If more candidates than seats remain, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, with the votes in their favour being transferred to other candidates as determined by the voters' next back-up preference. These elections and eliminations, and vote transfers if applicable, continue until enough candidates exceed quota to fill all the seats or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are unfilled seats, at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected. \n The specific method of transferring votes varies in different systems (see \u00a7 Counting methods).\n Advocates for STV say that it enables votes to be cast for individual candidates rather than for parties and party machine-controlled party lists, and \u2013 compared to first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting \u2013 reduces \"wasted\" votes (votes being wasted on losers and surplus votes being wasted on sure winners) by transferring them to other preferred candidates.\n STV also provides approximately proportional representation, even in non-partisan elections, ensuring that minority factions have some representation. The key to STV's achievement of proportionality is that each elector (voter) only casts one single vote, in an election electing multiple winners.  \n STV elections grow more proportional in direct relation to the number of seats to be elected in each constituency \u2013 the more seats to be won, the more the distribution of the seats in an STV election will be proportional. For example, in a three-seat STV election using the Hare Quota of \n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nvalid votes cast\n\n\n\n)\n\n/\n\n(\n\n\n\nseats to fill\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ({\\rm {\\mbox{valid votes cast}}})/({\\rm {\\mbox{seats to fill}}})}\n\n, a candidate needs only a third of the votes to win a seat. In a seven-seat STV election, any candidate who can get the support of approximately 14 percent of the vote (either first preferences alone or a combination of first preferences and transferred lower-ranked preferences) will win a seat.\n Advocates[who?] for STV argue it is an improvement over winner-take-all non-proportional voting systems such as first-past-the-post, where vote splits commonly result in a majority of voters electing no one and the successful candidate having support from just a minority of the district voters. STV prevents in most cases one single party taking all the seats and in its thinning out of the candidates in the field prevents the election of an extreme candidate or party if it does not have enough overall general appeal.\n STV is the system of choice of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia (which calls it quota-preferential proportional representation), the Electoral Reform Society in the United Kingdom and FairVote in the USA (which refers to STV as fair representation voting and instant-runoff voting as \"ranked-choice voting\", although there are other preferential voting methods that use ranked-choice ballots). \n Its critics contend that some voters find the mechanisms behind STV difficult to understand, but this does not make it more difficult for voters to rank the list of candidates in order of preference on an STV ballot paper (see \u00a7 Voting).\n Others[who?] see a vote transfer process that is more time-consuming than in first-past-the-post elections where the result is known within a few hours and say it is not worth using STV just to have more proportional results. However, STV's supporters say that some winners are known in the same period as under FPTP, and that with delays under FPTP caused by mail-in or absentee ballots, any delays in an STV scenario are not noticeable or are no great hardship.[citation needed]",

  "/wiki/Contingent_vote": "The contingent vote, also known as top-two IRV is an electoral system used to elect a single winner. It is a variation of instant-runoff voting (IRV), in which the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference. Under the contingent vote, there is a first round in which a candidate requires a majority of first preference votes to win. If no candidate has a majority, then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and there is a second count, where the votes of those who supported eliminated candidates are distributed among the two remaining candidates. This ensures that one candidate achieves a majority.\n The contingent vote differs from IRV which allows for many rounds of counting, eliminating only one weakest candidate each round. The contingent vote can also be considered a compressed form of the two-round system (runoff system), in which both 'rounds' occur without the need for voters to go to the polls twice.\n Today, a special variant of the contingent vote is used to elect the President of Sri Lanka. Another variant, called the supplementary vote, is used to pick directly elected mayors and police and crime commissioners in England. In the past the ordinary form of the contingent vote was used to elect the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1892 to 1942. To date, this has been the longest continuous use of the system anywhere in the world. It was also used in the US state of Alabama in the 1920s.",

Among the numerous art galleries and installations are, for example, Georgia O'Keefe Museum is located in the city, as is a gallery by cartoonist Chuck Jones, along with newer art collectives such as Meow Wolf.\n The area surrounding Santa Fe was occupied for at least several thousand years by indigenous peoples who built villages several hundred years ago on the current site of the city. It was known by the Tewa inhabitants as Ogha Po'oge (\"White Shell Water Place\"). The name of the city of Santa Fe means \"holy faith\" in Spanish, and the city's full name as founded remains La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds (\"The Royal Town of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis of Assisi\").",
  "/wiki/St._Paul,_MN": "Saint Paul (abbreviated St. Paul) is the capital and second-most populous city of the U.S. state of Minnesota. As of 2018, the city's estimated population was 307,695. Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County, the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota. The city lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding its point of confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Minneapolis, the state's largest city. Known as the \"Twin Cities\", the two form the core of Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with about 3.6 million residents.\n Founded near historic Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849. The Dakota name for Saint Paul is \"Imnizaska\". Regionally, the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home of the Minnesota Wild, and for the Science Museum of Minnesota. As a business hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab. Saint Paul, along with its twin city, Minneapolis, is known for its high literacy rate.\n The settlement originally began at present-day Lambert's Landing, but was known as Pig's Eye after Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant established a popular tavern there. When Lucien Galtier, the first Catholic pastor of the region, established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul (shortly thereafter to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul), he made it known that the settlement was now to be called by that name, as \"Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations\".",

  "/wiki/Telluride,_CO": "Telluride is the county seat and most populous town of San Miguel County in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Colorado.  The town is a former silver mining camp on the San Miguel River in the western San Juan Mountains. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878 as \"Columbia\", but due to confusion with a California town of the same name, was renamed Telluride in 1887 for the gold telluride minerals found in other parts of Colorado. These telluride minerals were never found near Telluride, but the area's mines for some years provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.\n Telluride sits in a box canyon. Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround it, with Bridal Veil Falls situated at the canyon's head. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free gondola connects the town with its companion town, Mountain Village, Colorado, at the base of the ski area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in popular culture, and it is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its ski resort and slopes during the winter, as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer.\n The Telluride Historic District, which includes a significant portion of the town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also one of Colorado's 20 National Historic Landmarks. The town population was 2,325 in the 2010 United States Census.",
  "/wiki/Ranked_voting": "Ranked voting is any election voting system in which voters use a ranked (or preferential) ballot to rank choices in a sequence on the ordinal scale: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. There are multiple ways in which the rankings can be counted to determine which candidate (or candidates) is (or are) elected (and different methods may choose different winners from the same set of ballots). The other major branch of voting systems is cardinal voting, where candidates are independently rated, rather than ranked.\n The similar term \"Ranked Choice Voting\" (RCV) is used by the US organization FairVote to refer to the use of ranked ballots with specific counting methods: either instant-runoff voting for single-winner elections or single transferable vote for multi-winner elections. In some locations, the term \"preferential voting\" is used to refer to this combination of ballot type and counting method, while  in other locations this term has various more-specialized meanings.\n A ranked voting system collects more information from voters compared to the single-mark ballots currently used in most governmental elections, many of which use First-Past-The-Post and Mixed-Member Proportional voting systems.\n There are many types of ranked voting, with several used in governmental elections. Instant-runoff voting is used in Australian state and federal elections, in Ireland for its presidential elections, and by some jurisdictions in the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. A type and classification of ranked voting is called the single transferable vote, which is used for national elections in Ireland and Malta, the Australian Senate, for regional and local elections in Northern Ireland, for all local elections in Scotland, and for some local elections in New Zealand and the United States. Borda count is used in Slovenia and Nauru. Contingent vote and Supplementary vote are also used in a few locations. Condorcet methods are used by private organizations and minor parties, but currently are not used in governmental elections.\n Arrow's impossibility theorem and  Gibbard's theorem prove that all voting systems must make trade-offs between desirable properties, such as the preference between two candidates being unaffected by the popularity of a third candidate. Accordingly there is no consensus among academics or public servants as to the \"best\" electoral system.\n Recently, an increasing number of authors, including David Farrell, Ian McAllister and Jurij Toplak, see preferentiality as one of the characteristics by which electoral systems can be evaluated. According to this view, all electoral methods are preferential, but to different degrees and may even be classified according to their preferentiality.   By this logic, cardinal voting methods such as Score voting or STAR voting are also \"preferential\"."
