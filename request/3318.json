  "/wiki/Aspen_Mountain_(ski_area)": "Aspen Mountain (often called by its former name of Ajax among locals) is a ski area in the western United States, located in Pitkin County, Colorado, just outside and above the city of Aspen. It is situated on the north flank of Aspen Mountain (for which it is named) at an elevation of 11,212 ft (3,417 m).
