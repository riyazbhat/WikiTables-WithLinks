  "/wiki/Watt-peak_AC": "The nominal power is the nameplate capacity of photovoltaic (PV) devices, such as solar cells, panels and systems, and is determined by measuring the electric current and voltage in a circuit, while varying the resistance under precisely defined conditions. These Standard Test Conditions (STC) are specified in standards such as IEC 61215, IEC 61646 and UL 1703; specifically the light intensity is 1000\u00a0W/m2, with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth's surface at latitude 35\u00b0N in the summer (airmass\u00a01.5), the temperature of the cells being 25\u00a0\u00b0C.  The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between an open and closed circuit (between maximum and minimum resistance).  The highest power thus measured is the 'nominal' power of the module in watts.  This nominal power divided by the light power that falls on a given area of a photovoltaic device (area \u00d7 1000\u00a0W/m2) defines its efficiency, the ratio of the device's electrical output to the incident energy.",
