  "/wiki/Jaws_(film)": "Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley's 1974 novel of the same name. In the film, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers at a New England summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw). Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.\n Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, Jaws had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n Considered one of the greatest films ever made, Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster, regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film until the release of Star Wars in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. Jaws was followed by three sequels, all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

  "/wiki/Zero_to_Sixty": "Zero to Sixty is a 1978 American comedy film directed by Don Weis and starring Darren McGavin, Sylvia Miles, Joan Collins, Denise Nickerson, and Dick Martin. The film was released on June 1, 1978 and was later reviewed by TV Guide, which called Darren McGavin \"fun to watch\" in the film, but noted the premise was brought to the screen six years later in a different film, Repo Man. This film was Denise Nickerson's last acting performance before her retirement and her death in 2019.",
  "/wiki/Jaws_2": "Jaws 2 is a 1978 American thriller film directed by Jeannot Szwarc and co-written by Carl Gottlieb. It is the sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and the second installment in the Jaws franchise. The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, with Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton reprising their respective roles as Martin's wife Ellen Brody and mayor Larry Vaughn. It also stars Joseph Mascolo, Jeffrey Kramer, Collin Wilcox, Ann Dusenberry, Mark Gruner, Susan French, Barry Coe, Donna Wilkes, and Gary Springer. The plot concerns Chief Brody suspecting another great white shark is terrorizing the fictional sea side resort of Amity Island following a series of incidents and disappearances and his suspicions are eventually proven true.\n Like the production of the original film, the production of Jaws 2 was troubled. The first director for the film, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.\nJaws 2 was briefly the highest-grossing sequel in history until Rocky II was released in 1979. The film's tagline, \"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...\" has become one of the most famous in film history and has been parodied and homaged several times. Although Jaws 2 received mixed reviews, it is generally considered to be the best of the three Jaws sequels. The film was followed by Jaws 3-D and Jaws: The Revenge, released in 1983 and 1987, respectively.",
  "/wiki/Just_You_and_Me,_Kid": "Just You and Me, Kid is a 1979 American comedy film starring George Burns, Brooke Shields,  Lorraine Gary, Ray Bolger, Leon Ames, Carl Ballantine, Keye Luke and Burl Ives. It was directed by Leonard B. Stern and was released in July 1979 by Columbia Pictures.",
  "/wiki/1941_(film)": "1941 is a 1979 American period war action comedy film directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, and featuring an ensemble cast including Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Toshiro Mifune, and Robert Stack. The story involves a panic in the Los Angeles area after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.\n Although not as financially or critically successful as many of Spielberg's other films, it received belated popularity after an expanded version aired on ABC and its subsequent broadcasts on cable television and home video reissues, raising it to cult status.\n Co-writer Gale stated the plot is loosely based on what has come to be known as the Great Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942 as well as the bombardment of the Ellwood oil refinery, near Santa Barbara, by a Japanese submarine. Many other events in the film were based on real incidents, including the Zoot Suit Riots and an incident in which the U.S. Army placed an anti-aircraft gun in a homeowner's yard on the Maine coast.",
  "/wiki/Jaws:_The_Revenge": "Jaws: The Revenge (also known as Jaws 4: The Revenge or Jaws 4) is a 1987 American horror thriller film produced and directed by Joseph Sargent, and starring Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest, Mario Van Peebles, and Michael Caine. It is the third sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and the fourth and final installment in the Jaws franchise.\n It was the final theatrical film to be directed by Sargent, as well as Lorraine Gray's final film role to date. She had come out of retirement for the role following her previous film 1941 (1979).\n The film focuses on a now-widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) and her conviction that a great white shark is seeking revenge on her family, particularly when it kills her son, and follows her to the Bahamas. Jaws: The Revenge was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films, Martha's Vineyard was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes.\n Jaws: The Revenge  was heavily panned by film critics. While production of the other three films in the series took around two years for each film, Jaws: The Revenge was made in less than nine months. According to associate producer and production manager Frank Baur during the sequel's filming, \"This (Revenge) will be the fastest I have ever seen a major film planned and executed in all of my 35 years as a production manager.\"",
