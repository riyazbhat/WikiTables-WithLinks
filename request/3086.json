The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history, while its shorter (1991 to 2013) football program, created by inviting one college and four other associate members (their football programs only) into the conference, resulted in two national championships. In basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships (UConn with three, Villanova, Georgetown, Syracuse, and Louisville with one each). Of the Big East's full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference, though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East.

  "/wiki/Ivy_League": "The Ivy League is an American collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private universities in the Northeastern United States.

The eight members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism. While the term was in use as early as 1933, it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division I athletic conference in 1954. Seven of the eight schools were founded during the colonial period (Cornell was founded in 1865), and thus account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The other two colonial colleges, Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary, became public institutions instead. Ivy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious in the world, and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report."
