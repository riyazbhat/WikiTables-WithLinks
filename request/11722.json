The start of the period was marked by the major Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event.

It was worked between c.\u00a02600 and c.\u00a02300 BC, although production may have continued well into the Bronze and Iron Ages (and later) owing to the low cost of flint compared with metals. Flint was much in demand for making polished stone axes in the Neolithic period. Much later, when flint had been replaced by metal tools, flint nodules were in demand for other uses, such as for building and as strikers for muskets.",
