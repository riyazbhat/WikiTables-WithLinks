  "/wiki/Sichuan_pepper": "Sichuan pepper (Chinese: \u82b1\u6912; pinyin: hu\u0101ji\u0101o) is a spice from the Sichuan cuisine of China's southwestern Sichuan Province. It has a unique aroma and flavor that is neither hot like chili peppers nor pungent like black pepper. Instead, it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth due to hydroxy-\u03b1-sanshool. It is commonly used in Sichuanese dishes such as mapo doufu and Chongqing hot pot, and is often added together with chili peppers to create a flavor known in Mandarin as m\u00e1l\u00e0 (\u9ebb\u8fa3; numb-spiciness). Despite its name, Sichuan pepper is not closely related to either black pepper or the chili pepper. It comes from the seeds of at least two species of small trees in the global genus Zanthoxylum (colloquially known as prickly ash) in the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and rue. The husk or hull (pericarp) around the seeds may be used whole, especially in Sichuan cuisine, and the finely ground powder is one of the ingredients for five-spice powder. Related species are used in the cuisines of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand, the Konkani and Kumaoni people of Northeast India, and the Toba Batak of Indonesia.",

Originally, the term t\u01b0\u01a1ng refers to a salty paste made from fermented soybeans, which is popular in vegetarian meals, particularly those prepared and eaten by Vietnamese Buddhist monks. It is also the most typical dipping sauce for summer rolls (g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n). The paste, which is generally dark brown in color, is produced by adding the fungus Aspergillus oryzae to roasted soybeans, which are then allowed to naturally ferment in a jar with water until it develops an umami flavor. Other ingredients, such as glutinous rice or maize powder, salt, or water, may also be used. T\u01b0\u01a1ng is similar to the Chinese yellow soybean paste, though the latter is generally saltier and thicker in texture. T\u01b0\u01a1ng may range in consistency from a thick paste to a thin liquid. Some varieties, such as that prepared in Central Vietnam, are watery, with solids at the bottom of the container in which it is stored.
