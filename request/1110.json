For his scientific works he is regarded as the \"father of transplantation\". He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as \"the wittiest of all scientific writers\", and Stephen Jay Gould as \"the cleverest man I have ever known\".\n Medawar was the younger son of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction, he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham, he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\".",

He established the field in a textbook which was updated in a number of editions.\n In particular, he studied metamorphosis. His most significant contribution was the discovery that neurosecretory cells in the brain of the South American kissing bug, Rhodnius prolixus, secrete a crucial hormone that triggers the prothoracic gland to release prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which regulates the process of metamorphosis. This was the first experimental confirmation of the function of neurosecretory cells. He went on to discover another hormone, called the juvenile hormone, which prevented the development of adult characteristics in R. prolixus until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage.  Wigglesworth was able to distort the developmental phases of the insect by controlling levels of this hormone.  From these observations, Wigglesworth was able to develop a coherent theory of how an insect's genome can selectively activate hormones which determine its development and morphology.",
