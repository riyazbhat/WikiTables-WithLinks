  "/wiki/FHM's_100_Sexiest_Women_(UK)": "FHM's 100 Sexiest Women is an annual listing compiled by the monthly British men's lifestyle magazine FHM, based on which women they believe to be the sexiest. As of 2017[update], each year's list is first announced through a section on FHM's official website, FHM.com. The first listing was published in 1995 and was voted for by a panel of 250 judges; the inaugural winner was the German supermodel Claudia Schiffer. From 1996 to 2015, the poll was instead voted for by the general public, with, at its height, several million votes being cast each year. Subsequent winners included the British singer Cheryl, the American actress Halle Berry, and Jennifer Lopez. [nb 1] At 36 years old, Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the listing, while Lopez was the first to top it more than once. By the time FHM ceased publication of its print edition in January 2016, the 100 Sexiest Women list had been compiled 21 times. The current holder of the Sexiest Woman title is the Israeli actress Gal Gadot.",
