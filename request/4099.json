On May 1, 2009, Borel won the Kentucky Oaks aboard  Rachel Alexandra, only the second time since 1993 that a jockey has won the Oaks-Derby combo, and just the seventh time overall a jockey has accomplished this feat in the same year. On May 16, 2009, Borel won the 2009 Preakness Stakes at Pimlico with thoroughbred filly Rachel Alexandra.  In doing so, Borel became the first jockey to win the first two jewels of the Triple Crown on different mounts.

To further promote the stallion, most of his offspring have \"Kitten\" in their names and, in some cases such as Breeders' Cup winners Bobby's Kitten and Stephanie's Kitten, the Ramseys honor friends or family members by incorporating their names as well.",
