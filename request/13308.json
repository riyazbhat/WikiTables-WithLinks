Night of the Comet, released in 1984, would be their first film to open on over 1000 screens.\n In 1985, they began a relationship with Paramount Pictures whereby the studio provided them money for larger-scale theatrical releases in exchange for home video and television rights to their films. In January 1989, Atlantic made a new deal with Kartes Video Communications for home video rights to the movies previously covered in the Paramount deal. However, they ultimately ceased operation shortly after this deal, amidst large financial losses from larger-budgeted films such as 1969. The library was bought by Island Pictures, which took over soliciting the films to home video. Island themselves suffered financial losses soon after, defaulting to Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and both the Atlantic and Island libraries were absorbed into the bank's large \"Epic\" catalogue of films inherited from studios that had borrowed and defaulted to the financial institution. Polygram Filmed Entertainment purchased the large catalogue from Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais in 1997; a year later, when Polygram themselves were acquired by Universal Studios, Universal sold PolyGram's pre-1996 library to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in October 1998.\n For a number of years, Paramount Pictures had TV and video distribution rights to Atlantic's library, some from their previous deal with the company, and others inherited when Viacom, who had purchased TV rights to many earlier Atlantic releases, merged with Paramount.
