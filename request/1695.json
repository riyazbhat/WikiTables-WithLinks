  "/wiki/Madison_Park_(Seattle)": "Madison Park is an 8.3 acre (34,000 m\u00b2) park in the Madison Park neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, located between the western shore of Lake Washington on the east, 42nd Avenue E. on the west, E. Madison Street on the north, and E. Blaine Street on the south. 43rd Avenue E. divides it into two sections; the east is a swimming beach and public dock, and the west is a playground, playfield, and tennis courts. Next to the beach is Madison Park Co-op, a community playhouse for toddlers and children. For the first 19 years of its existence, the Madison Street Cable Railway ran on Madison Street from Elliott Bay to the park. Service was cut back to 21st Avenue in 1910. There was also ferry service on Lake Washington from the early 1880s to August 31, 1950 from Madison Park across the lake to Kirkland. (The construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge in 1940 had greatly reduced demand and the continued existence of the run could no longer be justified after tolls were removed in 1949.)",

The Kingdome measured 660 feet (200 m) wide from its inside walls. The idea of constructing a covered stadium for a major league football or baseball team was first proposed to Seattle officials in 1959. Voters rejected separate measures to approve public funding for such a stadium in 1960 and 1966, but the outcome was different in 1968; King County voters approved the issue of US$40 million in municipal bonds to construct the stadium. Construction began in 1972 and the stadium opened in 1976 as the home stadium of the Sounders and Seahawks. The Mariners moved in the following year, and the SuperSonics moved in the next year, only to move back to the Seattle Center Coliseum in 1985.",

In September 1995, King County voters defeated a ballot measure to secure public funding for a new baseball stadium. Shortly thereafter, the Mariners' first appearance in the MLB postseason and their victory in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) renewed a public desire to keep the team in Seattle. As a result, the Washington State Legislature approved an alternate means of funding for the stadium with public money."
