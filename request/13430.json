  "/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(1981_radio_series)": "In 1981 BBC Radio 4 produced a dramatisation of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings in 26 half-hour stereo installments. The novel had previously been adapted as a 12-part BBC Radio adaptation in 1955 and 1956 (of which no recordings are known to have survived), and a 1979 production by The Mind's Eye for National Public Radio in the USA.\n Like the novel on which it is based, The Lord of the Rings is the story of an epic struggle between the Dark Lord Sauron of Mordor, the primary villain of the work, and an alliance of heroes who join forces to save the world from falling under his shadow.",
  "/wiki/Sam_Gamgee": "Samwise \"Sam\" Gamgee /\u02c8s\u00e6m\u02ccwa\u026az \u02c8\u0261\u00e6m\u02ccd\u0292i\u02d0/ (later known as Samwise Gardner) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The hobbit Samwise is the chief supporting character of The Lord of the Rings, in which he fills an archetypal role as the sidekick of the primary protagonist, Frodo Baggins. Sam is a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, which also includes Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Aragorn, and Gandalf.\n At the beginning of the story, Sam is Frodo's gardener, and is drawn into Frodo's adventure by Gandalf while eavesdropping on a private conversation. Throughout the story, Sam is Frodo's steadfast companion and servant, portrayed as both physically strong for his size and emotionally strong, often pushing Frodo through difficult parts of the journey, and at time carrying Frodo when he is too weak to go on. Sam serves as Ring-bearer for a short time when Frodo is captured; his emotional strength is again demonstrated when he willingly gives the Ring up when Frodo is able to take it again, the only character besides Bilbo Baggins and Tom Bombadil known to resist its pull. Following the War of the Ring Sam returns to the Shire and his role as gardener, helping to replant the trees which had been destroyed during The Scouring of the Shire. He is elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive terms, and in his old age is one of the last denizens of Middle-earth to be permitted to enter The Undying Lands, an honour accorded to him as one of the Ring-bearers.",
