  "/wiki/Barney_Google_and_Snuffy_Smith": "Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, originally Take Barney Google, F'rinstance, is an American comic strip created by cartoonist Billy DeBeck. Since its debut on June 17, 1919, the strip has gained a large international readership, appearing in 900 newspapers in 21 countries. The initial appeal of the strip led to its adaptation to film, animation, popular song and television. It added several terms and phrases to the English language and inspired the 1923 hit tune Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes) with lyrics by Billy Rose, as well as the 1923 record, Come On, Spark Plug! Barney Google himself, once the star of the strip and a very popular character in his own right, has been almost entirely phased out of the feature. An increasingly peripheral player in his own strip beginning in the late 1930s, Google was officially written out in 1954, although he would occasionally return for cameo appearances. These cameos were often years apart\u2014from a period between 1997 and 2012, Barney Google wasn't seen in the strip at all.
