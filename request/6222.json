It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema, with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year. While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom (299), Canada (206), Australia, and New Zealand also produce films in the same language, they are not considered part of the Hollywood system. Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema. Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles, often in Spanish or French.

Founded in 1934, the Turin-based company specialised in distributing non-Italian films during its first few years. Relocating in Rome in 1940, Lux began making its own films around this time, with the aim of its output being \"low risk and low budget by packaging high-quality art films with cultural content\". Unlike the studio system current in Hollywood at the time, the company did not have its own studios, but financed, distributed, and exhibited projects which others brought to it with 'fixed-price contracts' where co-producers were liable for any budget overruns. Gualino did employ executive producers, among whom were Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti. Ponti joined the firm in 1940 and was allocated an adaptation of an Italian classic novel Piccolo mondo antico (Small Old-fashioned World, 1941) directed by Mario Soldati and films starring the Italian comedian Tot\u00f2. De Laurentiis, who became an executive producer for Lux in 1942, oversaw such successful films as Alberto Lattuada's Il bandito (1946) and Mario Camerini's La figlia del capitano (The Captain's Daughter, 1947) and Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice, 1949).",
