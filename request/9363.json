  "/wiki/Ronnie_Earle": "Ronald Dale Earle (born February 23, 1942) was, until January 2009, the District Attorney for Travis County, Texas. He became nationally known for filing charges against House majority leader Tom DeLay in September 2005 for conspiring to violate Texas' election law and/or to launder money. Earle prosecuted other politicians, including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and State Representative Mike Martin, as well as Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox on charges of commercial bribery.\n His cases against Hutchinson and DeLay were unsuccessful; Hutchinson was found not guilty and DeLay's conviction was overturned on appeal about three years after the conviction. Earle's only success was with Mike Martin, although the felony perjury charge was reduced to a misdemeanor after a plea bargain. In 1985, as Travis County District Attorney, he accused then-Attorney General Jim Mattox of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and Clinton Manges, a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial. On one occasion, Earle prosecuted himself for an election law violation after missing a campaign finance filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212.",

  "/wiki/Jack_Abramoff_scandals": "The federal investigations into Jack Abramoff and his political and business dealings are among the broadest and most extensive in American political history,[citation needed] involving well over a dozen offices of the FBI and over 100 FBI agents tasked exclusively to the investigation. [citation needed]  Given the extent and complexity of the suspected corruption, an entire inter-governmental task force, involving many federal governmental departments and agencies, has been established to aid the federal investigation. [citation needed]  The U.S. Justice Department has announced that it will not reveal the details of the investigation, or who specifically has been targeted for investigation until indictments are issued. Under his plea agreements, Abramoff is required to answer all questions by federal investigators and prosecutors. The investigations led to several plea agreements by those involved, including Congressman Bob Ney (R-OH). Abramoff himself also pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges, including tax fraud and bribing public officials. Abramoff's activities also became an issue for many Democratic candidates in the November 2006 House and Senate elections, as many challengers painted the incumbent Republican Congress as corrupted by Abramoff and his powerful allies. On March 29, 2006, he was sentenced to five years and ten months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of more than $21 million.",
