It only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent immigrants from other states, see immigrant languages), which significantly differ from the majority or official language (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as Yiddish, Romani and  Lemko, which are used over a wide geographic area).",

  "/wiki/Turks_in_Serbia": "Turks in Serbia, also known as Serbian Turks are people of Turkish ancestry present in Serbia. Turks have lived on this territory since the Ottoman period. The Turkish minority has traditionally lived in the urban areas of Serbia, however in 1830, when the Principality of Serbia was granted autonomy, many Turks emigrated as \"muhacirs\" (refugees) to Turkey and by 1862 almost all of the remaining Turks left Central Serbia, including 3,000 from Belgrade. According to the 2011 census only 647 people declared themselves as Turks, though this does not include the Turkish minority in Kosovo.",
  "/wiki/Turkish_minorities_in_the_former_Ottoman_Empire": "The  Turkish minorities/communities in the former Ottoman Empire refers to ethnic Turks, who are the descendants of Ottoman-Turkish settlers from Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, living outside of the modern borders of the Republic of Turkey, and in the independent states which were formerly part of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, they are not considered part of Turkey's modern diaspora, rather, due to living for centuries in their respective regions (and for centuries under Turkish rule), they are now considered \"natives\" or \"locals\" as they have been living in these countries prior to the independence and establishment of the modern-nation states."
