Like many of Ibsen's plays, Ghosts is a scathing commentary on 19th-century morality. Because of its subject matter, which includes religion, venereal disease, incest, and euthanasia, it immediately generated strong controversy and negative criticism. Since then the play has fared better, and is considered a \u201cgreat play\u201d that historically holds a position of \u201cimmense importance\u201d.  \nTheater critic Maurice Valency wrote in 1963, \"From the standpoint of modern tragedy Ghosts strikes off in a new direction....
