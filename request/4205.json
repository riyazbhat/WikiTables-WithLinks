In modern Greek politics, New Democracy has been the main centre-right political party and one of the two major parties along with its historic rival, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). New Democracy, alongside PASOK, were created in the wake of the toppling of the military junta in 1974, which ruled Greece alternately for the previous four decades. Following the electoral decline of PASOK, New Democracy remained one of the two major parties in Greece, the other being the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA). Having spent four and a half years in opposition to SYRIZA's government, New Democracy regained its majority in the Hellenic Parliament and returned to government under Kyriakos Mitsotakis after the 2019 legislative election. The traditional support of New Democracy comes from an electorate leaning to the right and conservatives. From a geographical perspective, its main support base is in the rural areas of Greece as well as the city centers of Athens and Thessaloniki. Its support is generally weak in areas like West Greece, Attica, Crete and the Aegean Islands.",

The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples, including Celts, Romans, Germanic tribes, Huns, West Slavs and the Avars. The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin.

In practice, when this situation occurs, the Prime Minister is the leader of the party winning a plurality of votes in the election, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition.
