  "/wiki/Ivory-billed_woodpecker": "The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) is one of the largest woodpeckers in the world, at roughly 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) long and 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) in wingspan. It is native to the bottomland hardwood forests and temperate coniferous forests of the southeastern United States and Cuba. Habitat destruction and, to a lesser extent, hunting has reduced populations so thoroughly that the species is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the American Birding Association lists the ivory-billed woodpecker as a class 6 species, a category it defines as \"definitely or probably extinct\".  The last universally accepted sighting of an American ivory-billed woodpecker occurred in Louisiana in 1944.  However, sporadic reports of sightings and other evidence of the birds' persistence have continued ever since.  In the 21st century reported sightings and analyses of audio and visual recordings have been published in peer reviewed scientific journals as evidence the species persists in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida.  Various land purchases and habitat restoration efforts have been initiated in areas where sightings and other evidence have suggested a relatively high probability the species exists, to protect any surviving individuals.",
