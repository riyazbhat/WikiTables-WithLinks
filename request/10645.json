It is the fifth-most populous city in the state of New York following New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, and Yonkers. At the 2010 census, the city population was 145,252, and its metropolitan area had a population of 662,577. It is the economic and educational hub of Central New York, a region with over one million inhabitants. Syracuse is also well-provided with convention sites, with a downtown convention complex. Syracuse was named after the classical Greek city Syracuse (Siracusa in Italian), a city on the eastern coast of the Italian island of Sicily. The city has functioned as a major crossroads over the last two centuries, first between the Erie Canal and its branch canals, then of the railway network. Today, Syracuse is at the intersection of Interstates 81 and 90. Its airport is the largest in the region. Syracuse is home to Syracuse University, a major D-1 research university; Le Moyne College, a nationally recognized jesuit liberal arts college; SUNY Upstate Medical University, a public medical school; and SUNY ESF, a public university focusing on forestry, the environment, and natural resources.",
  "/wiki/I-690": "Interstate 690 (I-690) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that extends for 14.19 miles (22.84 km) through the vicinity of Syracuse, New York, in the United States. It is a spur of I-90 (here part of the New York State Thruway) that travels southeast from Thruway exit 39 in Van Buren to I-481 in DeWitt. In between, I-690 passes through the western suburbs of Syracuse before heading east through the city itself, where it meets I-81 in downtown Syracuse. The expressway continues northwest of the Thruway as New York State Route 690 (NY 690).",
  "/wiki/I-81_(NY)": "Interstate 81 (I-81) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Interstate 40 at Dandridge, Tennessee, to the Thousand Islands International Bridge at Wellesley Island in New York, beyond which a short stub links it to Ontario Highway 401. In the U.S. state of New York, I-81 extends 183.62 miles (295.51 km) from the Pennsylvania state line southeast of Binghamton to the Canadian border at Wellesley Island northwest of Alexandria Bay. The freeway runs north-south through Central New York, serving the cities of Binghamton, Syracuse, and Watertown. It passes through the Thousand Islands in its final miles and crosses two bridges, both part of the series of bridges known as the Thousand Islands Bridge. South of Watertown, I-81 closely parallels U.S. Route 11 (US 11), the main north-south highway in Central New York prior to the construction of I-81. At Watertown, US 11 turns northeastward to head across New York's North Country while I-81 continues on a generally northward track to the Canadian border. From there, the road continues into the province of Ontario as Highway 137, a short route leading north to the nearby Highway 401. The portion of I-81 in New York was originally developed as the Penn-Can Highway, one of four expressways proposed by the state in 1953. It was added to the Interstate Highway System and designated I-81 in 1957, and constructed in sections over the course of the next decade. The first segment was completed in the mid-1950s, running from Tully to the southern edge of Syracuse. The last piece opened in the late 1960s, linking Marathon to Whitney Point.",

East of Watertown, the route traverses mostly rural terrain and serves only small villages, such as Potsdam, Malone, and Champlain. While the portion of US 11 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watertown is merely an alternate route to I-81, the section east of Watertown is the primary long-distance route across the North Country of New York. US 11 was designated as part of the 1926 establishment of the U.S. Highway System.

North of Liverpool, NY 57 was routed along the eastern bank of the Seneca and Oswego Rivers. It passed through several riverside communities, including the village of Phoenix and the city of Fulton. The route largely paralleled NY 48, which follows the western bank of the waterway between Van Buren and Oswego via Baldwinsville. The origins of NY 57 date back to the early 20th century when the New York State Legislature created Route 34, an unsigned legislative route extending from Syracuse to Oswego by way of the future NY 57 corridor. This route became New York State Route 20 in 1924; however, NY 20 was renumbered to NY 57 just three years later. NY 57 remained virtually unchanged for the remainder of its existence. In later years, NY 57 was replaced in purpose by NY 481 south of Fulton, which led to its complete removal in 1982. The county routes that replaced NY 57 south of Fulton still bear the number 57 on signage in both counties, even though the portion of former NY 57 in Onondaga County is officially designated as County Route 91 (CR 91).",
  "/wiki/NY_370": "New York State Route 370 (NY 370) is an east-west state highway in Central New York in the United States. It extends for 35.23 miles (56.70 km) from an intersection with NY 104 and NY 104A south of the Wayne County village of Red Creek to a junction with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in the Onondaga County city of Syracuse. The western and central portions of the route pass through mostly rural areas; however, the eastern section serves densely populated areas of Onondaga County, including the villages of Baldwinsville and Liverpool. NY 370 also passes through Cayuga County, where it connects to NY 34, a major north-south highway in Central New York. NY 370 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a Red Creek-Liverpool highway, replacing NY 40 west of Cato and New York State Route 37 from Cato to Baldwinsville. From Liverpool to Syracuse, modern NY 370 was initially part of NY 57, a route that continued north from Liverpool to Oswego. That route was eliminated in 1982, at which time NY 370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY 57's former routing. Other minor changes, namely a series of realignments west of Victory, have also occurred in the years since NY 370 was assigned.",

  "/wiki/NY_481": "New York State Route 481 (NY 481) is a state highway in Central New York in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) in North Syracuse, where the highway continues southeastward as I-481. Its northern terminus is located at an intersection with NY 104 in Oswego about two blocks from Lake Ontario. In between, NY 481 serves the communities of Clay, Phoenix and Fulton along the Oswego River. NY 481 is one of two state routes in the Syracuse area that serves as an extension of an Interstate Highway; the other is NY 690. From its southern terminus to the Fulton city line, NY 481 is a four-lane limited-access highway with a handful of interchanges. It enters Fulton as a four-lane undivided highway, but gradually narrows to two lanes as it heads through the northern portion of the city. North of Fulton, NY 481 becomes a four-lane divided highway and proceeds to the outskirts of Oswego, where it reverts into a two-lane roadway. NY 481 also serves as a faster alternate to NY 48 from the Syracuse area to downtown Oswego. Both travel along the Oswego River, with NY 481 on the eastern side and NY 48 on the western side. NY 481 was commissioned in 1970 from North Syracuse to Fulton and extended northward to Oswego in 1982. The portion of the route north of Fulton was designated as NY 20 from 1924 to 1927 and NY 57 from 1927 to 1982.",
  "/wiki/NY_31": "New York State Route 31 (NY 31) is a state highway that extends for 208.74 miles (335.93 km) across western and central New York in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 104 in the city of Niagara Falls. Its eastern terminus is at a traffic circle with NY 26 in Vernon Center, a hamlet within the town of Vernon. Over its routing, NY 31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in Upstate New York: Buffalo-Niagara Falls, Rochester, and Syracuse. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, NY 104 to the north and NY 5 to the south, as well as the Erie Canal, as it proceeds east. Much of NY 31 west of Jordan was originally designated as part of a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY 31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route 30 (modern NY 31, NY 429, and NY 104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to Lenox. At Lenox, NY 31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY 316 and NY 46 to NY 5 in Oneida. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue east to Utica via Verona. With the advent of U.S. Route 104 (US 104) c. 1935, NY 31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing. NY 31 was truncated westward to NY 365 in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY 31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of New York State Route 234, a north-south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY 234 was transferred from the state of New York to Oneida County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.",
