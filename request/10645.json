It is the fifth-most populous city in the state of New York following New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, and Yonkers.\n At the 2010 census, the city population was 145,252, and its metropolitan area had a population of 662,577. It is the economic and educational hub of Central New York, a region with over one million inhabitants. Syracuse is also well-provided with convention sites, with a downtown convention complex. Syracuse was named after the classical Greek city Syracuse (Siracusa in Italian), a city on the eastern coast of the Italian island of Sicily.\n The city has functioned as a major crossroads over the last two centuries, first between the Erie Canal and its branch canals, then of the railway network. Today, Syracuse is at the intersection of Interstates 81 and 90. Its airport is the largest in the region. Syracuse is home to Syracuse University, a major D-1 research university; Le Moyne College, a nationally recognized jesuit liberal arts college; SUNY Upstate Medical University, a public medical school; and SUNY ESF, a public university focusing on forestry, the environment, and natural resources.",

It is a spur of I-90 (here part of the New York State Thruway) that travels southeast from Thruway exit\u00a039 in Van Buren to I-481 in DeWitt. In between, I-690 passes through the western suburbs of Syracuse before heading east through the city itself, where it meets I-81 in downtown Syracuse.

In the U.S. state of New York, I-81 extends 183.62 miles (295.51\u00a0km) from the Pennsylvania state line southeast of Binghamton to the Canadian border at Wellesley Island northwest of Alexandria Bay. The freeway runs north\u2013south through Central New York, serving the cities of Binghamton, Syracuse, and Watertown. It passes through the Thousand Islands in its final miles and crosses two bridges, both part of the series of bridges known as the Thousand Islands Bridge.\n South of Watertown, I-81 closely parallels U.S. Route\u00a011 (US\u00a011), the main north\u2013south highway in Central New York prior to the construction of I-81. At Watertown, US\u00a011 turns northeastward to head across New York's North Country while I-81 continues on a generally northward track to the Canadian border. From there, the road continues into the province of Ontario as Highway\u00a0137, a short route leading north to the nearby Highway\u00a0401.\n The portion of I-81 in New York was originally developed as the Penn-Can Highway, one of four expressways proposed by the state in 1953. It was added to the Interstate Highway System and designated I-81 in 1957, and constructed in sections over the course of the next decade. The first segment was completed in the mid-1950s, running from Tully to the southern edge of Syracuse. The last piece opened in the late 1960s, linking Marathon to Whitney Point.",

In addition, Ithaca College is a private, nonsectarian, liberal arts college  of over 7,000 students, located just south of the city in the Town of Ithaca, adding to the area's \"college town\" atmosphere.  Nearby is Tompkins Cortland Community College (TC3). These three colleges bring tens of thousands of students, who increase Ithaca's seasonal population during the school year. The city's voters are notably more liberal than those in the remainder of Tompkins County or in upstate New York, generally voting for Democratic Party candidates.\n As of 2010, the city's population was 30,014.

US\u00a020 connects to all three major north\u2013south Interstate Highways in Upstate New York: Interstate\u00a0390 (I-390) near Avon, I-81 south of Syracuse, and I-87 in Albany by way of Fuller Road Alternate.\n With the exception of Albany, it passes directly through no major cities of the state, bypassing Syracuse and Utica by great distances to the south while the New York State Thruway and New York State Route\u00a05 (NY\u00a05), which share its corridor, pass right through or close to them. It is, however, a major artery in many of the outlying areas it passes through in the hilly fringes of the Allegheny Plateau, often expanding to four lanes (it has no limited-access sections, although many intersecting roads are grade-separated) with extensive commercial strip development. One of these sections, the easterly of two concurrencies with NY\u00a05 across the northern Finger Lakes, is the longest concurrency in the state, extending 67 miles (108\u00a0km) from Avon to Auburn.\n From Oneida County to Albany, the road follows the historic Cherry Valley Turnpike, built at the beginning of the 19th century to connect Albany and, at the time, the important villages of Duanesburg, Cherry Valley, Cazenovia, and Skaneateles. US\u00a020 itself was assigned in 1926 and was the state's main east\u2013west route from that time until the Thruway was completed in the 1950s.",

The highway is 16.7 miles (26.9\u00a0km) long and passes through mostly rural regions. Route\u00a0174 begins at an intersection with NY\u00a041 in Borodino, a hamlet of Spafford. It heads generally northward for most of its length, except for short distances in the villages of Marcellus and Camillus. The route ends at a junction with NY\u00a05 west of Camillus, at the west end of the Route\u00a05 Camillus bypass. Route\u00a0174 is located along a large mapped sedimentary bedrock unit, known as the Marcellus Formation. The formation is named for an outcrop found near the town of Marcellus, New York, during a geological survey in 1839.\n The road was first constructed in the early 19th century following the path of Nine Mile Creek, which connected several early settlements in Central New York. The northern half of the route, between the villages of Marcellus and Camillus, was later improved as a plank road in 1855 by a private corporation that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over the maintenance of the road by the beginning of the 20th century. The former plank road and an extension south to Otisco Lake and southwest to Skaneateles Lake was first designated as Route\u00a0174 in the 1930 state highway renumbering. Since then, several minor realignments have been made in the areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.",

Over its routing, NY\u00a031 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in Upstate New York: Buffalo\u2013Niagara Falls, Rochester, and Syracuse. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, NY\u00a0104 to the north and NY\u00a05 to the south, as well as the Erie Canal, as it proceeds east.\n Much of NY\u00a031 west of Jordan was originally designated as part of a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s.
