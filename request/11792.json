  "/wiki/Bogot\u00e1": "Bogot\u00e1 (/\u02ccbo\u028a\u0261\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0/, also UK: /\u02ccb\u0252\u0261-/, US: /\u02c8bo\u028a\u0261\u0259t\u0251\u02d0/, Spanish: [bo\u0263o\u02c8ta] (listen)), officially Bogot\u00e1, Distrito Capital, abbreviated Bogot\u00e1, D.C., and formerly known as Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 between 1991 and 2000, is the capital and largest city of Colombia, administered as the Capital District, as well as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca. Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order, with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia. It is the political, economic, administrative and industrial center of the country. Bogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on August 6, 1538, by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca. The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region, and they called the place of the foundation Thybzaca or Old Town. The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca Bacat\u00e1 (or Mueket\u00e1) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota. There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacat\u00e1, the most accepted being that it means walling of the farmland in the Chibcha language. Another popular translation argues that it means The Lady of the Andes. Further, the word 'Andes' in the Aymara language means shining mountain, thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogot\u00e1 as The Lady of the shining mountain (notice, however, that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha). Others suggest that Bacat\u00e1 was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived. Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of Our Lady of Hope but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santaf\u00e9 (Holy Faith) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city. Santaf\u00e9 became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada (created in 1550), and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.",
