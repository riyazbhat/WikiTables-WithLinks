The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (NL) was formed in Chicago, Illinois by businessman, and owner of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as, the Chicago Cubs), William Hulbert, for the purpose of replacing the NA, which he believed to have been corrupt, mismanaged, full of rowdy, drunken ballplayers, and under the influence of the gambling community.  One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more.  The initial NL season began with eight teams, and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21.  The NL is considered to be the first \"major league\", although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_batting_champions": "In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). In MLB, a player in each league[L] wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year. The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\". Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title. However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title. Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs. Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title."
