  "/wiki/Decathlon": "The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events. The word \"decathlon\" was formed, in analogy to the word \"pentathlon\", from Greek \u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1 (d\u00e9ka, meaning \"ten\") and \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00e1thlos, or \u1f04\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u00e1thlon, meaning \"contest\" or \u201cprize\u201d). Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon. Traditionally, the title of \"World's Greatest Athlete\" has been given to the person who wins the decathlon, thus the world's greatest athlete of all times is the record-man of decathlon (Kevin Mayer as of September 2018). This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe, \"You, sir, are the world's greatest athlete\" after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912. The event is similar to the pentathlon held at the ancient Greek Olympics, and also similar to a competition called an \"all-around\", which was contested at the United States amateur championships in 1884."
