The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films.

The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and - under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith - the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015), and Lethal White (2018). Rowling has lived a rags to riches life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the world's first billionaire author.

She is the UK's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of \u00a3238 million.
