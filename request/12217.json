It is the fourth largest city and third largest metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighbouring Sandnes) and the administrative centre of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger.\n The city's rapid population growth in the late 20th century was primarily a result of Norway's booming offshore oil industry. Today the oil industry is a key industry in the Stavanger region and the city is widely referred to as the Oil Capital of Norway.[failed verification] Norwegian energy company Equinor, the largest company in the Nordic region, is headquartered in Stavanger. Multiple educational institutions for higher education are located in Stavanger. The largest of these is the University of Stavanger.\n Domestic and international military installations are located in Stavanger, including the NATO Joint Warfare Centre. Other international establishments, and especially local branches of foreign oil and gas companies, contribute further to a significant foreign population in the city. Immigrants make up 11.3% of Stavanger's population. Stavanger has since the early 2000s consistently had an unemployment rate significantly lower than the Norwegian and European average. In 2011, the unemployment rate was less than 2%. The city is also among those that frequent various lists of expensive cities in the world, and Stavanger has even been ranked as the world's most expensive city by certain indexes.\n Stavanger is served by international airport Stavanger Airport, Sola, which offers flights to cities in most major European countries, as well as a limited number of intercontinental charter flights. The airport was named most punctual European regional airport in 2010.\n Every two years, Stavanger organizes the Offshore Northern Seas (ONS), which is the second largest exhibition and conference for the energy sector. Gladmat food festival is also held each year and is considered to be one of Scandinavia's leading food festivals. The city is also known for being one of the nation's premier culinary clusters.

  "/wiki/Singapore": "Singapore (/\u02c8s\u026a\u014b(\u0261)\u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ (listen)), officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. Singapore is located about one degree (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, and by extension, the southernmost extremity of continental Asia. The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia's Riau Islands, its northern, western, and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia, and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east. It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east. The country's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets, the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects.\n Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history, modern Singapore, then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate, was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles, a British colonial officer, established a trading post of the East India Company on the island. In 1824, the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate, and in 1826, Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements, a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula. From 1830 to 1858, the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company's Bengal Presidency; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj. In 1867, Britain's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India, and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London, bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony. \n From 1867 to the 1940s, Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond. During the Second World War, Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore, resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. Following Japan's surrender in 1945, the Straits Settlements were dissolved, with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946. Following a protracted period of agitation against British colonial rule, Singapore gained internal self-governance from the British Empire in 1959. In 1963, Singapore, the Federation of Malaya, and the British Bornean crown colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo (Sabah) federated to form the fully emancipated Malaysian Federation, but after two tumultuous years as a constituent state of Malaysia and following intractable differences, Singapore seceded in 1965 to become a fully sovereign nation. After early years of turbulence, the newly sovereign nation, viewed as a nonviable state by many due to its size, absence of natural resources, and lack of a hinterland, defied odds by rapidly developing and industrialising under the leadership of the founding People's Action Party to become a high-income economy and developed country within a single generation. \n Singapore is the only truly sovereign city-state in the world; it has its own currency and a well-funded military that is considered the most advanced in Southeast Asia. It is a unitary parliamentary republic with a unicameral legislature that has been characterised by dominant-party rule since independence. The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Singapore a \"flawed democracy\" in 2019. The city-state is home to 5.6 million residents, 39% of whom are foreign nationals, including permanent residents. The country has four official languages: English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil; Malay, as the language of Singapore's indigenous people, is accorded special status in the country's constitution as the national and ceremonial language, while English is the lingua franca, being spoken as a common tongue by the vast majority of Singaporeans. As a legacy of its historical nature as an entrep\u00f4t, modern Singapore is a pluralistic country with a racially, culturally, and religiously diverse citizenry, with one indigenous ethnic group, the Malays, and two settler-descended ethnic groups, the Chinese and Indians, forming the historical and contemporary core of the country's citizen populace. As a reflection of this diversity, multiracialism has been enshrined as a foundational principle of the state, and has shaped the country's politics and national policies, particularly in education and housing. \n The country is one of the five founding members of ASEAN, is the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat and Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat, and is a member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, East Asia Summit, Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth of Nations. It is a highly developed country and is ranked 9th on the UN Human Development Index, the highest in Asia for a sovereign state, with the 7th highest GDP per capita in the world. Singapore is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 90%. Singaporeans enjoy one of the world's longest life expectancies and one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world. It is additionally classified as an Alpha+ global city, and is the only country in Asia with an AAA sovereign rating from all major rating agencies. It was ranked the most expensive city to live in since 2013, and has been identified as a tax haven. It is also a popular tourist destination, with well-known landmarks such as the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Jewel\u2014Changi Airport, the Orchard Road shopping belt, the resort island of Sentosa and the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the only tropical garden in the world to be honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
