  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead. The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to unpowered (or idler) axles. A refers to one powered axle, B to two powered axles in a row, C to three powered axles in a row, and D to four powered axles in a row. 1 refers to one idler axle, and 2 to two idler axles in a row. A dash (\u2013) separates trucks, or wheel assemblies.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.\n The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines, as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery. The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions. Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power. With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1, 2010, the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit.",

It was also the name of a passenger train, the third streamliner train in North America after the Union Pacific Railroad's M-10000 and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Pioneer Zephyr; the Flying Yankee was, in fact, a virtual clone of the latter, except that it dispensed with the baggage/mail space to seat 142 in three articulated cars.\n It ceased passenger service in 1957.

The weight of each car is spread between the Jacobs bogie. This arrangement provides the smooth ride of bogie carriages without the additional weight and drag.",
  "/wiki/CB&Q_9900": "The Pioneer Zephyr is a diesel-powered trainset built by the Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q), commonly known as the Burlington Route. The trainset was the second internal combustion powered streamliner built for mainline service in the United States, the first such train powered by a diesel engine, and the first to enter revenue service. The trainset consists of one power/RPO car, one baggage/buffet/coach car, and one coach/observation car. The cars are made of stainless steel, permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies. The construction incorporated recent advances such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and unibody construction  and articulation to reduce weight. It was the first of nine similarly built trainsets made for Burlington and its technologies were pivotal in the subsequent dieselization of passenger rail service. Its operating economy, speed, and public appeal demonstrated the potential for diesel-electric powered trains to revitalize and restore profitability to passenger rail service that had suffered a catastrophic loss of business with the Great Depression. Originally named the Burlington Zephyr during its demonstration period, it became the Pioneer Zephyr as Burlington expanded its fleet of Zephyr trainsets.",

The train's exterior structure used stainless steel, and had a shovel nose front. The locomotive, number 9903, was named Injun Joe. The three cars received other names of Mark Twain characters, Becky Thatcher, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. The train was christened on October 25, 1935 in Hannibal by Nina Clemens Gabilowitsch (1910-1966), the granddaughter and ultimately last descendant of its namesake.

Because its intended Kansas City, Missouri to St. Louis, Missouri route passed near the birthplace and boyhood home of famous World War I General John J. Pershing, the train was named after him.

In September, 1938, a second trainset was added, the 9903, which had previously served as the Mark Twain Zephyr running between Burlington, Iowa and St. Louis via Samuel Clemens' birthplace of Hannibal, Missouri. The Ozark State service inaugurated operating out of Kansas City in the morning and St. Louis in the afternoon, with the second trainset alternating.

It was the UP's third streamliner, and the last turret-cab streamliner. The original order was for two 1200 hp power cars, M-10002 and M-10003, of the same design as M-10001. However, the demands of Chicago-to-west-coast service led UP to expand the consists from six to nine cars and seek more power for the larger trainsets. Following the demonstration of multiple unit control systems with the EMC 1800 hp B-B units, the new technology was used to increase the power of M-10002 by adding a booster unit with the 900 hp engine that had been removed from M-10001 when it was rebuilt prior to entering regular service. The order for M-10003 was cancelled and the order number was used for one of the four more powerful locomotive sets built after M-10002. The cab unit was fitted with a 1,200 hp (890 kW) V16 Winton 201-A diesel engine and booster was equipped with a 900 hp (670 kW) V12 Winton 201-A engine.

The LWT12 was essentially an EMD SW1200 switcher locomotive, suitably geared for high-speed passenger service (83 mph) and wrapped in a distinctive aerodynamic shell. Its industrial styling was inspired by the hoods and grills of futuristic automobiles then on GM's drawing boards.
