  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.",

  "/wiki/CB&Q_9900": "The Pioneer Zephyr is a diesel-powered trainset built by the Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q), commonly known as the Burlington Route.  The trainset was the second internal combustion powered streamliner built for mainline service in the United States, the first such train powered by a diesel engine, and the first to enter revenue service.  The trainset consists of one power/RPO car, one baggage/buffet/coach car, and one coach/observation car.  The cars are made of stainless steel, permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies.  The construction incorporated recent advances such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and unibody construction  and articulation to reduce weight.  It was the first of nine similarly built trainsets made for Burlington and its technologies were pivotal in the subsequent dieselization of passenger rail service.  Its operating economy, speed, and public appeal demonstrated the potential for diesel-electric powered trains to revitalize and restore profitability to passenger rail service that had suffered a catastrophic loss of business with the Great Depression. Originally named the Burlington Zephyr during its demonstration period, it became the Pioneer Zephyr as Burlington expanded its fleet of Zephyr trainsets.",

Diesel power was provided by an EMD 567C 12-cylinder engine, which produced 1,200\u00a0hp (890\u00a0kW). Two other GM Diesel engines provided current for train-heating, lighting and air-conditioning. The LWT12 was underpowered, especially on grades, and the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads were required to supply a \"helper\" unit to assist them in service.  The LWT12 was essentially an EMD SW1200 switcher locomotive, suitably geared for high-speed passenger service (83\u00a0mph) and wrapped in a distinctive aerodynamic shell.
