It is one of the four sacred canonical texts (\u015bruti) of Hinduism known as the Vedas. The text is layered consisting of the Samhita, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads. [note 1] The Rigveda Samhita is the core text, and is a collection of 10 books (ma\u1e47\u1e0dalas) with 1,028 hymns (s\u016bktas) in about 10,600 verses (called \u1e5bc, eponymous of the name Rigveda). In the eight books \u2013 Books 2 through 9 \u2013 that were composed the earliest, the hymns predominantly discuss cosmology and praise deities. The younger books (Books 1 and 10) in part also deal with philosophical or speculative questions, virtues such as d\u0101na (charity) in society, questions about the origin of the universe and the nature of god, and other metaphysical issues in their hymns. The Rigveda is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text. Its early layers are one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language.",
  "/wiki/Veda": "The Vedas (/\u02c8ve\u026ad\u0259z, \u02c8vi\u02d0-/; Sanskrit: \u0935\u0947\u0926 veda, knowledge) are a large body of religious texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauru\u1e63eya, which means not of a man, superhuman and impersonal, authorless. Vedas are also called \u015bruti (what is heard) literature, distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called sm\u1e5bti (what is remembered). The Veda, for orthodox Indian theologians, are considered revelations seen by ancient sages after intense meditation, and texts that have been more carefully preserved since ancient times. In the Hindu Epic the Mahabharata, the creation of Vedas is credited to Brahma. The Vedic hymns themselves assert that they were skillfully created by Rishis (sages), after inspired creativity, just as a carpenter builds a chariot. [note 1]\n According to tradition, Vyasa is the compiler of the Vedas, who arranged the four kinds of mantras into four Samhitas (Collections).",
  "/wiki/Samhita": "Samhita literally means put together, joined, union, a collection, and a methodically, rule-based combination of text or verses. Samhita also refers to the most ancient layer of text in the Vedas, consisting of mantras, hymns, prayers, litanies and benedictions. Parts of Vedic Samhitas constitute the oldest living part of Hindu tradition.",

It is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism and the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism. Sanskrit, in its variants and numerous dialects, was the lingua franca of ancient and medieval India. In the early 1st millennium CE, along with Buddhism and Hinduism, Sanskrit migrated to Southeast Asia, parts of East Asia and Central Asia, emerging as a language of high culture and of local ruling elites in these regions. Sanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language. As one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European family of languages,[note 1][note 2] Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. It is related to Greek and Latin, as well as Hittite, Luwian, Old Avestan and many other living and extinct languages with historical significance to Europe, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. It traces its linguistic ancestry to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language, Proto-Indo-Iranian and the Proto-Indo-European languages.",

An ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, it is a compilation of ritual-offering formulas that were said by a priest while an individual performed ritual actions such as those before the yajna fire. Yajurveda is one of the four Vedas, and one of the scriptures of Hinduism. The exact century of Yajurveda's composition is unknown, and estimated by scholars to be around 1200 to 1000 BCE, contemporaneous with Samaveda and Atharvaveda. The Yajurveda is broadly grouped into two \u2013 the black or dark (Krishna) Yajurveda and the white or bright (Shukla) Yajurveda. The term black implies the un-arranged, unclear, motley collection of verses in Yajurveda, in contrast to the white which implies the well arranged, clear Yajurveda. The black Yajurveda has survived in four recensions, while two recensions of white Yajurveda have survived into the modern times. The earliest and most ancient layer of Yajurveda samhita includes about 1,875 verses, that are distinct yet borrow and build upon the foundation of verses in Rigveda.",
  "/wiki/Sama_Veda": "The Samaveda (Sanskrit: \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0935\u0947\u0926, s\u0101maveda, from s\u0101man song and veda knowledge), is the Veda of melodies and chants. It is an ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, and part of the scriptures of Hinduism. One of the four Vedas, it is a liturgical text which consists of 1,549 verses. All but 75 verses have been taken from the Rigveda. Three recensions of the Samaveda have survived, and variant manuscripts of the Veda have been found in various parts of India. While its earliest parts are believed to date from as early as the Rigvedic period, the existing compilation dates from the post-Rigvedic Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit, c. 1200 or 1000 BCE, roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda. Embedded inside the Samaveda is the widely studied Chandogya Upanishad and Kena Upanishad, considered as primary Upanishads and as influential on the six schools of Hindu philosophy, particularly the Vedanta school. The classical Indian music and dance tradition considers the chants and melodies in Samaveda as one of its roots.",

The text is the fourth Veda, but has been a late addition to the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism. The Atharvaveda is composed in Vedic Sanskrit, and it is a collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into 20 books. About a sixth of the Atharvaveda texts adapts verses from the Rigveda, and except for Books 15 and 16, the text is in poem form deploying a diversity of Vedic matters. Two different recensions of the text \u2013 the Paippal\u0101da and the \u015aaunak\u012bya \u2013 have survived into modern times. Reliable manuscripts of the Paippalada edition were believed to have been lost, but a well-preserved version was discovered among a collection of palm leaf manuscripts in Odisha in 1957. The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the Veda of magical formulas, an epithet declared to be incorrect by other scholars. In contrast to the 'hieratic religion' of the other three Vedas, the Atharvaveda is said to represent a 'popular religion', incorporating not only  formulas for magic, but also the daily rituals for initiation into learning (upanayana), marriage and funerals.",

  "/wiki/Shakha": "A shakha (Sanskrit \u015b\u0101kh\u0101, branch or limb), is a Hindu theological school that specializes in learning certain Vedic texts, or else the traditional texts followed by such a school. An individual follower of a particular school or recension is called a \u015b\u0101khin. The term is also used in Hindu philosophy to refer to an adherent of a particular orthodox system. A related term cara\u1e47a, (conduct of life or behavior) is also used to refer to such a Vedic school: although the words cara\u1e47a and \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 are sometimes used synonymously, yet cara\u1e47a properly applies to the sect or collection of persons united in one school, and \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 to the traditional text followed, as in the phrase \u015b\u0101kh\u0101m adhite, (he recites a particular version of the Veda). The schools have different points of view, described as difference of (Vedic) school (\u015b\u0101kh\u0101bheda\u1e25). Each school would learn a specific Vedic Sa\u1e43hita (one of the four Vedas properly so-called), as well as its associated Brahmana, Aranyakas, Shrautasutras,  Grhyasutras and Upanishads. In traditional Hindu society affiliation with a specific school is an important aspect of class identity. By the end of the Rig Vedic period the term Br\u0101hma\u1e47a had come to be applied to all members of the priestly class, but there were subdivisions within this order based both on caste and on the shakha (branch) with which they were affiliated.",

Described as the most complete, systematic, and important of the Brahmanas (commentaries on the Vedas), it contains detailed explanations of Vedic sacrificial rituals, symbolism, and mythology. Particularly in its description of sacrificial rituals (including construction of complex fire-altars), the Shatapatha Brahmana (SB) provides scientific knowledge of geometry (e.g. calculations of Pi and the equivalent of the Pythagorean theorem) and observational astronomy (e.g. planetary distances and the assertion that the Earth is circular) from the Vedic period. The Shatapatha Brahmana is also considered to be significant in the development of Vaishnavism as the origin of several Puranic legends and avatars of the RigVedic god Vishnu. Notably, all of them (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, and Vamana) are listed as the first five avatars in the Dashavatara (the ten principal avatars of Vishnu).
