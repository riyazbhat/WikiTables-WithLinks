  "/wiki/Andro_Dunos": "Andro Dunos[a] is a scrolling shooter arcade video game developed by Visco Corporation and originally published by SNK on June 15, 1992. It is the first title to be created by Visco for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms, as well as their only officially licensed release for the AES during its commercial life span.\n Taking place on a futuristic sci-fi setting where an unknown alien race from outer space has steadily increased their invasion activities, players assume control of the Yellow Cherry and Red Fox space fighter crafts in a last-ditch effort for mankind to overthrow the alien forces. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS, Andro Dunos was later released for the Neo Geo AES on July 17 of the same year.\nAndro Dunos was met with mixed reception from both critics and reviewers alike since its initial release on the MVS and later on the AES, who commended various aspects of the title such as the colorful and detailed graphics, sound design, simplistic controls and the ability to choose between multiple weapons, but the gameplay was criticized for being unremarkable and not original.",

It was the first system in SNK's Neo Geo family. The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit; its CPU is technically a 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor, while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus. The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS (Multi Video System) coin-operated arcade machine. The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet, a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace, as well as saving money long-term. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork. A home console version was also made, called AES (Advanced Entertainment System). It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan (called Neo Geo Rental System), with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use \u2013 this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console.",

  "/wiki/Arcade_game": "An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost. The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry.",

The company was founded by Michael Kogan in 1953 as the Taito Trading Company, importing vodka, vending machines and jukeboxes into Japan. It would begin production of video games in 1973. In 2005, Taito was purchased by Square Enix, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary by 2006. Taito is recognized as an important player in the early days of video games, producing several hit games such as Space Invaders, Bubble Bobble, Arkanoid, and Darius. Alongside Konami, Namco and Sega, it is one of the most prominent video game companies from Japan and the first that exported its games into other countries. Several of its games have since been recognized as important and revolutionary for the industry - Space Invaders in particular was a major contributor to the growth of video games in the mid-1970s, and the aliens featured in the games are seen as iconic emblems within the video game industry. The company maintains a chain of arcade centers, known as Game Taito Stations, across Japan, alongside being a manufacturer of toys, plush dolls and UFO-catcher prizes.",

The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market. In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components, including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU. Released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Sega's expectations despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher. 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide.",
