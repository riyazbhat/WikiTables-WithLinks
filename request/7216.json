  "/wiki/Entrepreneur": "Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a small business.

A broader definition of the term is sometimes used, especially in the field of economics. In this usage, an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technologies into products and services: The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital, talent, and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation. In this sense, the term Entrepreneurship also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms, in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses.
