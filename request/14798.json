There are 128 members elected to a four-year term in multi-member constituencies, apportioned among Lebanon's diverse Christian and Muslim denominations but with half of the seats reserved for Christians per Constitutional Article 24[circular reference]. Lebanon has universal adult suffrage. Its major functions are to elect the President of the republic, to approve the government (although appointed by the President, the Prime Minister, along with the Cabinet, must retain the confidence of a majority in the Parliament), and to approve laws and expenditure.\n On 15 May 2013, the Parliament extended its mandate for 17 months, due to the deadlock over the electoral law. And, on 5 November 2014, the Parliament enacted another extension, thus keeping its mandate for an additional 31 months, until 20 June 2017, and in 16 June 2017 the Parliament in turn extended its own mandate an additional 11 months to hold elections according to a much-anticipated reformed electoral law. On May 6, 2018, a new parliament was elected in the 2018 general election, thus ending the mandate of the 2009 parliament who extended it for about 5 years.",

It was co-founded by Musa al-Sadr and Hussein el Husseini as the Movement of the Dispossessed in 1974. The Amal movement gained attention from Shia outcry after the disappearance of Musa al-Sadr and saw a renewal in popularity after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978. The Iranian Revolution of 1978\u201379 also provided momentum for the party. The Amal Movement is, by a small margin, the largest Shia party in parliament, having sixteen representatives to Hezbollah's thirteen.

  "/wiki/Populism": "Populism refers to a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of the people and often juxtapose this group against the elite. The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, although has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within political science and other social sciences, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether. A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach: this defines populism as an ideology which presents the people as a morally good force and contrasts them against the elite, who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how the people are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present the elite as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups\u2014such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants\u2014above the interests of the people. Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the voice of the people. According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, or socialism.",

  "/wiki/Anti-Zionism": "Anti-Zionism is opposition to Zionism.  The term is broadly defined in the modern era as opposition to the State of Israel or, prior to 1948, its establishment. It has also been defined as opposition to the political movement of Jews to self-determination within the territory variously referred to as the Land of Israel, Palestine, Canaan, or the Holy Land.\n The term is used to describe various religious, moral and political points of view, but their diversity of motivation and expression is sufficiently different that anti-Zionism cannot be seen as having a single ideology or source.  There is also a difference between how it is discussed philosophically and how it is enacted within a political or social campaign. Some sources take the view that anti-Zionism has become a cover for modern-day antisemitism, a position that critics have challenged as a tactic to silence criticism of Israeli policies.

  "/wiki/Secularism": "Secularism, as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is indifference to, or rejection or exclusion of, religion and religious considerations. In certain contexts, the word can connote anticlericalism, atheism, desire to exclude religion from social activities or civic affairs, banishment of religious symbols from the public sphere, state neutrality toward religion, the separation of religion from state, or disestablishment  (separation of church and state). As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world, without recourse to religion. Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius; from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, Denis Diderot, Voltaire, Baruch Spinoza, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; and from more recent freethinkers\natheists such as Matthew W. Dillahunty, Robert Ingersoll, Bertrand Russell, and Christopher Hitchens. It shifts the focus from religion to other temporal and this-worldly things, with emphasis on nature, reason, science, and development. In political terms, secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries (the attainment of such is termed secularity). Defined briefly, secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion, leaving religious choice to the liberty of the people. One form of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people.",

  "/wiki/Lebanese_nationalism": "Lebanese nationalism is a nationalistic ideology that considers the Lebanese people are a distinct nation independent from the Arab world. It considers the Lebanese people to be direct descendants of the Phoenician people. Supporters of this theory of Lebanese ethnogenesis maintain that the Lebanese are descended from Phoenicians. This ideology has its roots in the 19th century sectarian wars in Mount Lebanon between the Maronites and Druze. [citation needed] It took its formalized form during the inter-war period and the French Mandate of Syria, when it served primarily as a tool in opposing Arab nationalism and in justifying the existence of the nascent country of Lebanon. During the 20th century and the Lebanese Civil War, Lebanese nationalism was associated with the Kataeb Party, Lebanese Forces, National Liberal Party and secularist movements like Guardians of the Cedars and the Lebanese Renewal Party, spearheaded by the renowned late Lebanese poet and philosopher Said Akl. The Lebanese nationalism goes even further and incorporates irredentist views going beyond the Lebanese borders, seeking to unify all the lands of ancient Phoenicia around present day Lebanon. This comes from the fact that present day Lebanon, the Mediterranean coast of Syria, and northern Israel is the area that roughly corresponds to ancient Phoenicia and as a result the majority of the Lebanese people identify with the ancient Phoenician population of that region.",
