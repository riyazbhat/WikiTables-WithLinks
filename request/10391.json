Known as the Raffles Programme, it is offered jointly with its sister school, Raffles Girls' School (Secondary), or RGS. RI was among the first schools to receive the Ministry of Education's School Excellence Award. It is a member of various academic partnerships and alliances, such as the G20 Schools and The Winchester Network. It also co-founded the Global Alliance of Leading-Edge Schools. RI was awarded the Singapore Quality Award in 2011. RI is notable for having produced 94 President's Scholars, 3 out of 7 Presidents, 2 out of 3 Prime Ministers, including the first elected Prime Minister in Lee Kuan Yew, 4 Speakers of Parliament, 7 out of 20 members of the current Cabinet, 6 Ministers of State and 13 CEOs of government-linked statutory boards and agencies. It is often cited as Singapore's premier school and has been recognised as the top feeder school for the Ivy League universities plus Stanford and MIT, as well as the top feeder school for Oxford University.",

  "/wiki/Barry_Marshall": "Barry James Marshall AC FRACP FRS FAA (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian physician, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, and Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall and Robin Warren showed that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) plays a major role in causing many peptic ulcers, challenging decades of medical doctrine holding that ulcers were caused primarily by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. This discovery has allowed for a breakthrough in understanding a causative link between Helicobacter pylori infection and stomach cancer.",
