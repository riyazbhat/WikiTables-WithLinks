The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces, a feature sought by military close quarters combat units, law enforcement SWAT team users, and home defense purposes.

They told passers-by that they had killed a soldier to avenge the killing of Muslims by the British armed forces. Unarmed police arrived at the scene nine minutes after an emergency call was received and set up a cordon. Armed police officers arrived five minutes later. The assailants, armed with a cleaver and brandishing a gun, charged at the police, who fired shots that wounded them both.",
  "/wiki/Woolwich": "Woolwich (/\u02c8w\u028al\u026at\u0283, -\u026ad\u0292/) is a district of southeast London, England, within the Royal Borough of Greenwich. It has been part of the London metropolitan area since the 19th century. In 1965, most of the former Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich became part of Greenwich Borough, of which it remains the administrative centre. The population of Woolwich (including its localities Plumstead and Shooter's Hill) was 84,959 in the 2011 census.\n The town is a river crossing point, with the Woolwich Ferry and the Woolwich foot tunnel crossing to North Woolwich in the London Docklands. Throughout the 17th, 18th, 19th and most of the 20th century, Woolwich was an important naval, military and industrial town. After several decades of economic hardship and social deprivation, large-scale urban renewal projects have turned its fortunes around. It is expected that the town, identified in the London Plan as \"opportunity area\", will evolve from \"major centre\" to \"metropolitan centre\" within Greater London in the next few decades.",

  "/wiki/LGBT": "LGBT (also acronymed as  LGBTQ(+) or  GLBT) is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism  LGB, which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred. The initialism has become adopted into the mainstream  as an umbrella term for use when labeling topics pertaining to sexuality and gender identity. For example, the LGBT Movement Advancement Project termed community centres, which have services specific to those members of the LGBT community, as \"LGBT community centers\", in a comprehensive studies of such centres around the United States. The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures.

To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity;  LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996.",
