  "/wiki/Abbey_River": "The Abbey River is a right-bank backwater of the River Thames in England, in Chertsey, Surrey \u2014 in the town's northern green and blue buffers.

Its offtake from the Thames is at the apex of Penton Hook, Staines upon Thames below its lower weir close to the Chertsey-Thorpe boundary in the Borough of Runnymede. Its outfall is the weir pool of Chertsey Lock back into the Thames, visible from Chertsey Bridge.  The Environment Agency plans to build similar channels to the upstream Jubilee River, one of which will intersect the watercourse, another of which will be close to its outfall, thereby compensating for loss of its historic bypass functions.",

It achieves this by taking water from the left (at this point eastern) bank of the Thames upstream of Boulter's Lock near Maidenhead and returning it via the north bank downstream of Eton, Berkshire.  Although successful in its stated aims, residents of villages downstream claim it has increased flooding.",
