  "/wiki/Charles_Duncan_McPherson": "Col. Charles Duncan McPherson (April 11, 1877 - 1970) was a soldier, journalist and politician from Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1910-14, and again from 1915-22. He was a Liberal, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. McPherson was born in Forest, Ontario, the son of Dougald McPherson, and was educated in the neighbouring area. He began work as an apprentice with the Forest Free Press in 1893. He moved to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba in 1896 and worked as a printer and later foreman there, in Neepawa and in Fort William, Ontario. From 1889 to 1901, he was manager and editor for the Weekly Manitoba Liberal in Portage la Prairie. In 1901, McPherson bought that paper and then, in 1903, the Daily Graphic, merging the two. In 1905, he established the Fort William Herald with R.G. McCuish. He became editor of the Winnipeg Western Editor in 1911.

  "/wiki/Lakeside_(electoral_district)": "Lakeside is a provincial electoral division in Manitoba, Canada. It is located to the immediate northwest of the city of Winnipeg. Traditionally a rural riding, Lakeside has become more urban in recent years (as a result of both electoral redistribution and changes in demography). All the same, agriculture accounted for 17% of the riding's industry in 1999. The riding is bordered to the north by Interlake, to the west by Portage la Prairie, to the south by Morris and to the east by Gimli. It also borders the city of Winnipeg to the southeast. There are no major urban centres in the riding. Communities include Argyle, Balmoral, Rosser, Gunton, Stonewall, Stony Mountain, Teulon, Warren, Woodlands and Inwood. Lakeside's population in 1996 was 19473. The average family income in 1999 was C$49,774, with an unemployment rate of 6.10%. Eight per cent of the population is of a German background, and 8% are aboriginal. Lakeside was created by provincial redistribution in 1886."
