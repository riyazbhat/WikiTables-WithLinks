  "/wiki/Anatolian_languages": "The Anatolian languages are an extinct family of Indo-European languages that were spoken in Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia), the best attested of them being the Hittite language. Undiscovered until the late 19th and 20th centuries, they are considered the earliest group of languages to branch off from the Indo-European family. Once discovered, the presence of laryngeal consonants \u1e2b and \u1e2b\u1e2b in Hittite and Luwian provided support for the laryngeal theory of Proto-Indo-European linguistics. While Hittite attestation ends after the Bronze Age, hieroglyphic Luwian survived until the conquest of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms by Assyria, and the alphabetic Anatolian languages are fragmentarily attested until the early first millennium AD, eventually succumbing to the Hellenization of Asia Minor.",

The other Italic languages became extinct in the first centuries CE as their speakers were assimilated into the Roman Empire and shifted to some form of Latin.

  "/wiki/Milyan_language": "Milyan, also known as Lycian B and previously Lycian 2, is an ancient Anatolian language formerly regarded as a variety of Lycian, but now accorded status as a separate language. It is attested from two inscriptions, one of 45 syllables on the Xanthus Stele, and the other, shorter, from a sarcophagus at Antiphellus. The Xanthus inscription is in verse, with strophes marked off by the use of \u27e8)\u27e9. In 1999 the Dutch scholar Alric van den Broek wrote an MA thesis at the Leiden University on the probable metric features of the Lycian B text of the Xanthos stele. Using Ivo Hajnal\u2019s definitions of Lycian B syllables, he indicated  that there is a significantly high number of word boundaries around the 11th, 22nd and 33rd syllable before (on the left side of) the phrase ending sign <)>. Therefore, he argued, the text must have been a poem with four lines per phrase \u2013 the first one being either 7(+/-1) or 11(+/-1) syllables long and the last three lines counting 11(+/-1) syllables. Moreover, the metrical foot may have counted four syllables, with accents on syllables one, five and nine of each verse. His model also seemed to fit the few things we know of Lycian, Anatolian and Proto-Indo-European accent."
