  "/wiki/Rapper": "Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed in time to musical accompaniment. Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music, it is commonly associated with that genre in particular; however, the origins of rap precede hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which \"oral historians\", or \"praise-singers\", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their rhetorical techniques for gossip or to \"praise or critique individuals.\" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of black verbal reverence[definition needed], through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's verbal taunts and the poems of The Last Poets.[vague] Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the \"Black rhetorical continuum\", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through \"creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies\". The person credited with originating the style of \"delivering rhymes over extensive music\", that would become known as rap, was Anthony \"DJ Hollywood\" Holloway from Harlem, New York.",

  "/wiki/Rap_group": "Hip hop music,  also called hip-hop or rap music, is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans and Latino Americans in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s. It consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing.  Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, \"hip hop\" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.",
