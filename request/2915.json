  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture.\nIn the Italianate style, the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture, which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism, were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics. The style of architecture that was thus created, though also characterised as \"Neo-Renaissance\", was essentially of its own time. \"The backward look transforms its object,\" Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles; \"every spectator at every period\u2014at every moment, indeed\u2014inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature.\"\n The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash, with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire. This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England, from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras. The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s. Barry's Italianate style (occasionally termed \"Barryesque\")  drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance, though sometimes at odds with Nash's semi-rustic Italianate villas.\n The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms, long after its decline in popularity in Britain, throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire. From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States, where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis.",

  "/wiki/Oneota": "Oneota is a designation archaeologists use to refer to a cultural complex that existed in the eastern plains and Great Lakes area of what is now occupied by the United States from around AD 900 to around 1650 or 1700.  Based on classification defined  in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology, the Oneota culture belongs to formative stage.  The culture is believed to have transitioned into various Siouan cultures of the protohistoric and historic times, such as the Ioway[citation needed].  A long-accepted ancestry to the Ho-chunk has yet to be conclusively demonstrated.\n Oneota is considered a major component of Upper Mississippian culture.  It is characterized by globular, shell-tempered pottery that is often coarse in fibre. Pieces often had a spherical body, short necks and/or a flat lip. Sometimes the vessels had strap handles.  Decoration includes wavy and zigzag lines, often in parallel. Most decoration was done on the top half of the vessel.\n Analytically, the culture has been broken down into various stages or horizons. Generally accepted are the following:",
  "/wiki/Chicago,_Milwaukee,_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Depot_and_Lunchroom": "The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Depot and Lunchroom are two buildings located in Wells, Minnesota, and built by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (otherwise known as The Milwaukee Road) in 1903.\n The town of Wells was platted by a precursor to The Milwaukee Road in 1869. As the town grew, it became a junction, with one branch of the railroad continuing west toward Sioux Falls, South Dakota and a second branch going north toward Farmington, Minnesota. The railroad placed a railyard at Wells. In 1903, as railroad operations expanded, The Milwaukee Road built the present station out of brick. It also built the lunchroom (or \"beanery\") to serve the train crews as well as passengers and the town. The lunchroom was also built of brick and is located adjacent to the depot.\n The depot is a single-story, rectangular building with a passenger waiting area on one end and a freight room on the other. The agent's office was located between the two. The lunchroom is also a single-story, rectangular building. It was altered from its original appearance with the addition of a wood-frame room and garage. The lunchroom would have had a kitchen and dining area; however, at the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the lunchroom had already been sold to private individuals who converted it into a residence.\n The depot served freight trains and mixed trains (combining both passengers and freight) as an office for the train crews and passenger ticket and waiting area. In the 1960s, as passenger service was terminated, the depot continued to serve the rail yard as an office.\n After The Milwaukee Road went bankrupt and was sold to the Soo Line Railroad in 1985, the depot continued to be used. The Soo Line then sold this rail line to the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad (IC&E) (a subsidiary of the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad). The IC&E continued to use the depot for its train crews until 2005, when it built new offices on the opposite side of the tracks.\n In 2007, the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern was merged into the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The CPR planned to close the depot and demolish it as surplus. Instead the CPR sold the depot to the Wells Historical Society for a nominal sum.[clarification needed] The Society restored the depot and opened it as a museum in 2010.\n The depot and lunchroom were listed in the National Register due to their association with the development of the town of Wells and also for their association with the development of railroads in Minnesota.",

  "/wiki/Church_of_the_Good_Shepherd-Episcopal_(Blue_Earth,_Minnesota)": "Church of the Good Shepherd Episcopal is a historic church at Moore and 8th Streets in Blue Earth, Minnesota.  The city of Blue Earth was established in 1856, and although most of its early settlers were Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians also arrived in the city.  The first Episcopal service in the city was held in the Presbyterian church in town on December 10, 1867.  In 1870, Bishop Henry Whipple asked the Reverend Solomon Stephens Burleson to visit the city and consider serving the Episcopal community as its resident pastor.  Whipple and Burleson returned in 1871, and Whipple offered the parish $3000 for construction of a church if the parish would pay for the rectory.  The parish accepted the offer, and Burleson moved from his parish in Northfield to establish the church.  Burleson designed the building himself.  It has a rectangular shape, with a steeply-pitched roof.  A tower topped with a shingled steeple is located on one side of the building.  Construction was completed on March 21, 1872, and Whipple returned to consecrate the building on August 13, 1872.\n It was added to the National Register in 1980.  In 1982, the three remaining members of the congregation donated the building to the Faribault County Historical Society.",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival (also referred to as Victorian Gothic, neo-Gothic, or Gothick) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England. Its momentum grew in the early 19th century, when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture, in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time. Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style, including decorative patterns, finials, lancet windows, hood moulds and label stops.\n The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England, gaining ground in the 19th. Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism. Ultimately, the \"Anglo-Catholicism\" tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century. Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original, sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods.\n In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England, interest spread to the rest of Europe, Australia, Sierra Leone, South Africa and to the Americas; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide. The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s. New architectural movements, sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement, and sometimes in outright opposition, such as Modernism, gained ground, and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored. The later 20th century saw a revival of interest, manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958.",

  "/wiki/Richardsonian_Romanesque": "Richardsonian Romanesque is a style of Romanesque Revival architecture named after architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838\u20131886). The revival style incorporates 11th and 12th century southern French, Spanish and Italian Romanesque characteristics. Richardson first used elements of the style in his Richardson Olmsted Complex in Buffalo, New York, designed in 1870. Multiple architects followed in this style in the late 1800s; Richardsonian Romanesque later influenced modern styles of architecture as well.",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.\n The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture. Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style.\n In form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Therefore, the style defined by symmetry, simple geometry, and social demands instead of ornament. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings.\n In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as Classicism, while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.",
