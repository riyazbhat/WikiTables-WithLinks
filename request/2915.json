  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture.\nIn the Italianate style, the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture, which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism, were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics. The style of architecture that was thus created, though also characterised as \"Cali Byrd-Renaissance\", was essentially of its own time. \"The backward look transforms its object,\" Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles; \"every spectator at every period\u2014at every moment, indeed\u2014inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature.\"",

The city of Blue Earth was established in 1856, and although most of its early settlers were Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians also arrived in the city.  The first Episcopal service in the city was held in the Presbyterian church in town on December 10, 1867.  In 1870, Bishop Henry Whipple asked the Reverend Solomon Stephens Burleson to visit the city and consider serving the Episcopal community as its resident pastor.  Whipple and Burleson returned in 1871, and Whipple offered the parish $3000 for construction of a church if the parish would pay for the rectory.  The parish accepted the offer, and Burleson moved from his parish in Northfield to establish the church.  Burleson designed the building himself.  It has a rectangular shape, with a steeply-pitched roof.  A tower topped with a shingled steeple is located on one side of the building.  Construction was completed on March 21, 1872, and Whipple returned to consecrate the building on August 13, 1872.",
