  "/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix": "The Australian Grand Prix is a motor race held annually in Australia currently under contract to host Formula One until 2025. The Grand Prix is the second oldest surviving motor racing competition held in Australia, after the Alpine rally first held in 1921, having been contested 83 times since it was first run at Phillip Island in 1928. It is currently sponsored with naming rights by Swiss watchmaker Rolex.\n Prior to its inclusion in the World Championship, it was held at a multitude of venues in every state of Australia. It was a centrepiece of the Tasman Series in most years between 1964 and 1972 and was a round of the Australian Drivers' Championship on many occasions between 1957 and 1983.\n Unusual, even for a race of such longevity, as of 2018 the location of the Grand Prix has moved frequently with 23 different venues having been used over its life, a number eclipsing the 16 venues used for the French Grand Prix since its own 1906 start.\n The race became part of the Formula One World Championship in 1985 and was held at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Adelaide, South Australia, from that year to 1995. From 1996 it has been held at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne. The winner of the race is presented with a circular plate, recently named the Jack Brabham trophy in a design based on the steering wheel of one of Brabham's racing cars and a perpetual trophy, the Lex Davison trophy. These trophies each date back to the 1960s.[citation needed]\n Since moving to Melbourne, the Australian Grand Prix has been the first race of the F1 World Championship excluding 2006 and 2010. When held in Adelaide it was the final round of the Championship, hosting numerous races memorable for deciding Championship results, most notably the 1986 and 1994 races which saw the 1986 and 1994 World Drivers' Championships decided.\n Australian driver Lex Davison and German driver Michael Schumacher are the most successful drivers in the 86-year history of the event taking four wins each, while McLaren and Ferrari have been the most successful constructors with twelve victories each. Frenchman Alain Prost is the only driver to win the Australian Grand Prix in both Australian domestic and World Championship formats, having won the race in 1982 driving a Formula Pacific Ralt RT4 and in Formula One in 1986 and 1988.",

Both races were held at the Tanaka International Aida circuit (now Okayama International Circuit), a slow, twisty 3.7-kilometre (2.3-mile) track deep in the countryside in Aida (near Kobe), Japan.  Following the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the Pacific Grand Prix was moved from early in the calendar to the end.\n The Pacific Grand Prix has also been held at Laguna Seca from 1960 through 1963, but these events were non-Championship.\n The inaugural Championship race in 1994 saw Michael Schumacher take an easy victory after Ayrton Senna was involved in a first corner accident with Mika H\u00e4kkinen and Nicola Larini.  Schumacher overtook Senna into the first corner and was never threatened for the lead from that point onward. Schumacher could have lapped second placed Gerhard Berger in the last third of the race, but chose not to. The fastest lap was set on lap 3. The race was notable for the Jordan team and Rubens Barrichello's first podium finishes in F1 with third place.  The more recent Pacific Grand Prix in 1995 was a more eventful affair, with some close racing throughout the field.  The race culminated in a tactical victory for Michael Schumacher, securing his second World Championship, and making him the youngest double World Champion at the time.  Fernando Alonso surpassed Schumacher's record by winning his second World Championship in 2006. Alonso's record was in turn surpassed by Sebastian Vettel in 2011.\n This race made Japan one of only seven countries (the others being Great Britain, Spain, Germany, Italy, France and the USA) to ever host more than one Formula One event in the same year.  It was discontinued primarily due to the TI Circuit's location in a remote area of Japan.\n With the announcement that the Japanese Grand Prix would switch from the Suzuka Circuit to the Fuji Speedway from 2007, there had been media speculation that Suzuka may retain a race under a resurrection of the Pacific Grand Prix title. However, it was later announced that the Japanese Grand Prix would alternate between Fuji and Suzuka from 2009 onward although the alternation was cancelled as Toyota, the current Fuji Speedway owner discontinued further F1 races at Fuji, having pulled out of F1 at the end of 2009.",

The track was well surfaced and relatively flat \u2013 ranging from 15 to about 30 metres in elevation.\n The circuit has hosted the Formula One British Grand Prix five times, in 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1962.\n In addition to the Grands Prix, which were organised by the British Automobile Racing Club, the circuit also held eleven non-championship Formula 1 races, known as the Aintree 200, first won by Stirling Moss in 1954 with the last winner being Jack Brabham, in April 1964 (Brabham had made his Formula One debut at the circuit in the 1955 British GP). Aintree was the location for the famous race in 1955 in which Stirling Moss won his first British Grand Prix, driving a Mercedes. Two years later, he and Tony Brooks (sharing the Vanwall) became the first British drivers to win both the British Grand Prix and a round of the Formula 1 World Championship, whilst driving a British car, a Vanwall. The 1957 Grand Prix also took the title of Grand Prix de Europe and was the premier Formula 1 event of the season, attracting 150,000 spectators.\n The full Grand Prix circuit was last raced on in 1964, but part of it (the 1.535-mile (2.47 km) Club Circuit) is still open and was used for racing until the early 1980s, having been operated by the Aintree Circuit Club from the mid-1960s to the late 1990s. In the 1980s the 108 Car Club (St. Helens) brought rallying back to Aintree Circuit revitalising the circuit's use with new and innovative ideas.  A limited amount of motor sport continues today in the form of car sprints, track days and motorcycle racing on the Club Circuit.\n The motorcycle events are organised by Aintree Motor Cycle Racing Club, who run six events at Aintree each year.\n The car events are organised by Liverpool Motor Club in the form of three sprints, in April, June and September and two track days in May and October on the club circuit. Nick Algar, the 2010 British Sprint Champion, set a new course record of 35.82 seconds on the 1847-metre sprint course on 26 June 2010 in a Gould GR55 3500cc. The record was previously set by Roy Dawson on 8 September 2007 in the same car, in a time of 36.03 seconds. Nick Algar's speed through the finish line speed trap was 172 mph, although he did manage a speed of 176 mph on an earlier timed run that day.\n In addition, the Club Circuit sees occasional use by visiting events such as the Greenpower Electric Car Races for Schools, Sporting Bears Motor Club giving Dream Rides for charity, and also bicycle racing.
