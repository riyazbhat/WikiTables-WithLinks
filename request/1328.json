  "/wiki/Avondale_Mill": "The Avondale Mill was a large gable-front stone structure, three stories in height, and 10 bays long by three wide. It was located on the bank of the Patuxent River in the city of Laurel, Prince George's County, Maryland.  It was constructed in 1844-1845 for Captain William Mason & Son of Baltimore. It was complemented by the neighboring Laurel Mill built in 1811  S.D. Heath's machine shop and Richard Israel's flouring mill. At that time it was provided with the machinery for the manufacture of fine cloth, running as many as 1,500 cotton spindles with 150 employees. In 1845, industrialist Peter Gorman was responsible for the first macadamized (paved) road in Laurel, Avondale Street next to the new Mill.\n The mill was sold for $10,000 with a $13,000 ground rent in 1850 to S.P. Heath and James Arthur (Webb Heath & Co.). In the mid-1850s, it was converted to a gristmill. The waters of the Patuxent provided an 8\u20139 foot fall and gave the mill 60-70 horsepower to use, along with steam power fueled by coal from Cumberland as early as 1854. George William Brown purchased the 21.7 acre property and outbuildings from Benjamin F. Crabbs, but sold his holdings in a mortgage auction on 20 October 1897. By 1904, the mill employed only 4 people, but produced $10,400 in product annually. Avondale Mill was the only one of Laurel's 19th century mills to have survived into the late 20th century.  A devastating fire on December 19, 1991, destroyed the mill. The remains were then demolished and the site cleared for use as a community park.\n It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property.\n The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts.\n For most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, as well as coordinate, identify and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.\n Occasionally, historic sites outside the country proper, but associated with the United States (such as the American Embassy in Tangiers) are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts and multiple property submissions (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties: district, site, structure, building or object. National Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non-contributing properties. Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include National Historic Landmarks (NHL), National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks, National Memorials and some National Monuments. (Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the Antiquities Act because of either their historical or natural significance. They are managed by multiple agencies. Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register.)",
  "/wiki/Duvall_Bridge_(Laurel,_Maryland)": "Duvall Bridge is an historic single-lane bridge over the Patuxent River near Laurel, Maryland.\n A bridge has been located on this site since the mid-18th century although the current bridge is estimated to have been constructed circa 1907. The first bridge was constructed to serve the mill at the 450-acre plantation of Dr. Charles Duvall \"Goodwood\" renamed later to \"Gladswood\". The Duvall family had arrived in Anne Arundel County with arrival of Mareen Duvall in 1650. Mareen Duvall's Middle Plantation is downriver on the same path, now called Davidsonville Road. The Steel bridge was constructed in 1907. The bridge provided water crossing for the main Baltimore-Washington telegraph lines following \"telegraph road\". In 1936, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center was created on the land, and the bridge was transferred to the federal government in 1941. A plaque was installed in 1966 by the Duvall society. The bridge was condemned in 1977 after flooding. The bridge was rehabilitated in 2012 and serves as a connection between the central tract and north tract of Patuxent Research Refuge.\n Although a common bridge type, Duvall Bridge is one of only two surviving truss bridges in Prince George's County, along with Governor's Bridge. The Duvall bridge has a cross braced deck for wooden planking. The bridge has a plaque noting the Anne Arundel county commissioners of 1907:",
  "/wiki/Patuxent_Wildlife_Research_Center": "Since its establishment in 1936 as the first wildlife experiment station in the United States, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has been a leading international research institute for wildlife and applied environmental research, for transmitting research findings to those responsible for managing the United States's natural resources, and for providing technical assistance in implementing research findings so as to improve natural resource management.\n Patuxent's scientists have been responsible for many important advances in natural resource conservation, especially in such areas as migratory birds, national monitoring programs for amphibians and birds, wildlife population analysis, waterfowl harvest, habitat management, wetlands, coastal zone and flood plain management, contaminants, endangered species, urban wildlife, ecosystem management, and management of national parks and national wildlife refuges.\n The Center develops and manages national inventory and monitoring programs and is responsible for the North American Bird Banding Program and leadership of other national bird monitoring programs. The Center's scientific and technical assistance publications, wildlife databases, and electronic media are used nationally and worldwide in managing biological resources.",
  "/wiki/Pratt_truss": "A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss, a structure of connected elements usually forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads.  The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently.",
  "/wiki/Old_Laurel_High_School": "Old Laurel High School is a historic former school building on Montgomery Street in Laurel, Maryland.  Built in 1899, it was the original home of Laurel High School, and now houses a community center.\n Laurel High School was founded in 1899 with an enrollment of 59 students and four teachers. According to the city government, as reported by The Washington Post, the 1900 graduating class was all women. The original school building is now the Phelps Community Center in Laurel. The cupola on top was used during World War II as a Civil Defense Aircraft Spotting Station for identifying enemy aircraft. In 1965, the high school was moved to a larger building on Cherry Lane. The last class at the original location held a 50th reunion in 2015.\n The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as \"Laurel High School\".",

  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (reporting marks B&O, BO) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States, with its first section opening in 1830. Merchants from the city of Baltimore, which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century, wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal (which served New York City), another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania (which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (which connected to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.), and the James River Canal, which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia. At first the B&O was located entirely in the state of Maryland, its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook.\n Because of competition with the C&O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland, it could not use the C&O right of way. Thus, to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains, the B&O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia (now West Virginia), near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers. From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River, where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland, the terminus of the National Road. From there the B&O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg, West Virginia (below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year). It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War, although the conflict also caused considerable damage (and repair costs). After the war's end, the B&O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia, as well as expanded westward into Ohio (including a junction at Portsmouth), Indiana and Illinois. B&O advertising later carried the motto: \"Linking 13 Great States with the Nation.\"\n After several mergers, the B&O became part of the CSX Transportation (CSX) network. The B&O also includes the Leiper Railroad, the first permanent horse-drawn railroad in the U.S. At the end of 1970, the B&O operated 5,552 miles of road and 10,449 miles of track, not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit (SIRT) or the Reading and its subsidiaries. It includes the oldest operational railroad bridge in the United States.\n When CSX established the B&O Railroad Museum as a separate entity from the corporation, it donated some of the former B&O Mount Clare Shops in Baltimore, including the Mt. Clare roundhouse, to the museum, while selling the rest of the property. The B&O Warehouse at the Camden Yards rail junction in Baltimore now dominates the view over the right-field wall at the Baltimore Orioles' current home, Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\n Part of the B&O Railroad's immortality has come from being one of the four featured railroads on the U.S. version of the board game Monopoly; it is the only railroad on the board that did not directly serve Atlantic City, New Jersey.",

  "/wiki/Maryland_Route_197": "Maryland Route 197 (MD 197) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Laurel Bowie Road, the state highway runs 14.64 miles (23.56 km) from U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in Bowie north to MD 198 in Laurel. MD 197 serves as the main connection between Bowie and Laurel in northern Prince George's County. The highway also provides access to Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and Bowie State University. MD 197 also connects US 50 in Bowie and the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway in South Laurel with the Bowie State MARC station.\n MD 197 was constructed from what is now MD 450 in Bowie to US 1 in Laurel between the mid-1920s and early 1930s. The highway was extended south to US 301 in the mid-1950s. MD 197's northern terminus was relocated in the mid-1960s. The portion through Laurel and South Laurel was expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1970s. MD 197 was relocated from its original course through Old Town Bowie to its present course near Bowie State University in the late 1980s; much of this segment was built as divided highway. The highway's southern end was expanded to a divided highway concurrent with the expansion of the US 50 interchange. MD 197's 1950s-era interchange with the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway was reconstructed in the early 2000s.",
