  "/wiki/Avondale_Mill": "The Avondale Mill was a large gable-front stone structure, three stories in height, and 10 bays long by three wide. It was located on the bank of the Patuxent River in the city of Laurel, Prince George's County, Maryland. It was constructed in 1844-1845 for Captain William Mason & Son of Baltimore. It was complemented by the neighboring Laurel Mill built in 1811  S.D. Heath's machine shop and Richard Israel's flouring mill. At that time it was provided with the machinery for the manufacture of fine cloth, running as many as 1,500 cotton spindles with 150 employees. In 1845, industrialist Peter Gorman was responsible for the first macadamized (paved) road in Laurel, Avondale Street next to the new Mill. The mill was sold for $10,000 with a $13,000 ground rent in 1850 to S.P.",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property. The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts. For most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, as well as coordinate, identify and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties.",
  "/wiki/Duvall_Bridge_(Laurel,_Maryland)": "Duvall Bridge is an historic single-lane bridge over the Patuxent River near Laurel, Maryland. A bridge has been located on this site since the mid-18th century although the current bridge is estimated to have been constructed circa 1907. The first bridge was constructed to serve the mill at the 450-acre plantation of Dr. Charles Duvall Goodwood renamed later to Gladswood. The Duvall family had arrived in Anne Arundel County with arrival of Mareen Duvall in 1650. Mareen Duvall's Middle Plantation is downriver on the same path, now called Davidsonville Road. The Steel bridge was constructed in 1907. The bridge provided water crossing for the main Baltimore-Washington telegraph lines following telegraph road. In 1936, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center was created on the land, and the bridge was transferred to the federal government in 1941.",
  "/wiki/Patuxent_Wildlife_Research_Center": "Since its establishment in 1936 as the first wildlife experiment station in the United States, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has been a leading international research institute for wildlife and applied environmental research, for transmitting research findings to those responsible for managing the United States's natural resources, and for providing technical assistance in implementing research findings so as to improve natural resource management.\n Patuxent's scientists have been responsible for many important advances in natural resource conservation, especially in such areas as migratory birds, national monitoring programs for amphibians and birds, wildlife population analysis, waterfowl harvest, habitat management, wetlands, coastal zone and flood plain management, contaminants, endangered species, urban wildlife, ecosystem management, and management of national parks and national wildlife refuges.\n The Center develops and manages national inventory and monitoring programs and is responsible for the North American Bird Banding Program and leadership of other national bird monitoring programs.

  "/wiki/Pratt_truss": "A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss, a structure of connected elements usually forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads.  The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently.",

  "/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad": "The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (reporting marks B&O, BO) was the first common carrier railroad and the oldest railroad in the United States, with its first section opening in 1830. Merchants from the city of Baltimore, which had benefitted to some extent from the construction of the National Road early in the century, wanted to continue to compete for trade with trans-Appalachian settlers with the newly constructed Erie Canal (which served New York City), another canal being proposed by Pennsylvania (which would have connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (which connected to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.), and the James River Canal, which directed traffic toward Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia. At first the B&O was located entirely in the state of Maryland, its original line extending from the port of Baltimore west to Sandy Hook. Because of competition with the C&O canal for trade with coal fields in western Maryland, it could not use the C&O right of way. Thus, to continue westward while minimizing high-cost track through the Appalachian Mountains, the B&O chose to cross the Potomac River into Virginia (now West Virginia), near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers. From there track continued through Virginia from Harpers Ferry to a point just west of the junction of Patterson Creek and the North Branch Potomac River, where it crossed back into Maryland to reach Cumberland, the terminus of the National Road. From there the B&O extended to the Ohio River at Wheeling and a few years later also to Parkersburg, West Virginia (below rapids which made navigation difficult during parts of the year). It proved crucial to Union success during the American Civil War, although the conflict also caused considerable damage (and repair costs).",
