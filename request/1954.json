The Bale Mountains Vervet is one of the least known primates in Africa. The Bale Mountains Vervet avoid tree-dominated and bush land areas as their habitat. These monkeys mainly reside in the bamboo forest (Odubullu Forest) of the Bale mountain due their dietary specialization on bamboo, however, other factors such as climate, forest history, soil quality, and disease could are likely to play a role in their choice to inhibit this area.

The term \"vervet\" is also used to refer to all the members of the genus Chlorocebus. The five distinct subspecies can be found mostly throughout Southern Africa, as well as some of the eastern countries. Vervets were introduced to Florida, St. Kitts, and Cape Verde. These mostly herbivorous monkeys have black faces and grey body hair color, ranging in body length from about 40 centimetres (16 in) for females, to about 50 centimetres (20 in) for males. In addition to behavioral research on natural populations, vervet monkeys serve as a nonhuman primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans. They have been noted for having human-like characteristics, such as hypertension, anxiety, and social and dependent alcohol use. Vervets live in social groups ranging from 10 to 70 individuals, with males moving to other groups at the time of sexual maturity.",

Some older sources treat the Dryas monkey as a subspecies of the Diana monkey and classify it as C. diana dryas, but it is geographically isolated from any known Diana monkey population.\n While the Dryas monkey had been considered data deficient, evidence suggests it is very rare and its total population possibly numbers fewer than 200 individuals. Consequently, its status was changed to critically endangered in the 2008 IUCN Red List. Along with being listed by the IUCN, this species is also listed on Appendix II of CITES.

The greater spot-nosed monkey lives in groups consisting of one adult male, a number of adult females, and their dependent offspring.
