  "/wiki/U.S._Route_91": "U.S. Route\u00a091 or U.S. Highway 91 (US-91) is a 172.663-mile-long (277.874\u00a0km) north\u2013south United States highway running from Brigham City, Utah to Idaho Falls, Idaho in the U.S. states of Idaho and Utah.

Prior to the mid-1970s, US\u00a091 was an international commerce route from Long Beach, California to the Canada\u2013US border north of Sweetgrass, Montana. US\u00a091 was routed on the main streets of most of the communities it served, including Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas and State Street in Salt Lake City. From Los Angeles to Salt Lake, the route was built along the corridor of the Arrowhead Trail. US\u00a091 has been largely replaced by Interstate 15. A portion of the highway's former route in California is currently State Route\u00a091.",
