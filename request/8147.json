  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth. Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids. On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io and Titan, visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded, buried or transformed by tectonics over time. Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography, the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.",
  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere.\n In more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius r.",
  "/wiki/Eponym": "An eponym is a person, place, or thing after whom or after which something is named, or believed to be named, or the thing so named. The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic. For example, Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era, and the eponymous founder of the Ford Motor Company refers to Henry Ford, and Ford and Elizabethan England are both eponyms.",
  "/wiki/Eastman_(crater)": "Eastman is a crater on Mercury first seen by MESSENGER during the mission's first Mercury flyby. Eastman exhibits some features characteristic of a fresh, relatively young crater. The walls of Eastman have clearly visible terraces, and the central peak structure is well preserved. Eastman is located near Xiao Zhao crater.\n It is named for Charles Eastman (Santee Dakota), known as one of the first Native American to graduate from an American medical school, Boston University, and to be licensed as a doctor. He worked on Sioux reservations in South Dakota, where he met and married Elaine Goodale from Massachusetts, who headed BIA schools. They had several children together. In later life he became known as an important author of the Native American culture, publishing nine books about his Santee Sioux childhood.",
  "/wiki/Charles_Eastman": "Charles Alexander Eastman (born Hakadah and later named Oh\u00edye S'a; February 19, 1858 \u2013 January 8, 1939) was a Santee Dakota physician educated at Boston University, writer, national lecturer, and reformer. In the early 20th century, he was one of the most prolific authors and speakers on Sioux ethnohistory  and American Indian affairs.\n Eastman was of Santee Dakota, English and French ancestry. After working as a physician on reservations in South Dakota, he became increasingly active in politics and issues on Native American rights, he worked to improve the lives of youths, and founded thirty-two Native American chapters of YMCA. He also helped found the Boy Scouts of America. He is considered the first Native American author to write American history from the Native American point of view.",

  "/wiki/Uzo_Egonu": "Uzo Egonu (25 December 1931 \u2013 14 August 1996) was a Nigerian-born artist who settled in Britain in the 1940s, only once returning to his homeland for two days in the 1970s, although he remained concerned with African political struggles. According to Rasheed Araeen, Egonu was perhaps the first person from Africa, Asia or the Caribbean to come to Britain after the War with the sole intention of becoming an artist. According to critic Molara Wood, Egonu\u2019s work merged European and Igbo traditions but more significantly, placed Africa as the touchstone of modernism. In combining the visual languages of Western and African art, he helped redefine the boundaries of modernism, thereby challenging the European myth of the na\u00efve, primitive African artist.",

  "/wiki/Ellington_(crater)": "Ellington is a crater on Mercury named after Duke Ellington, an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra.  It was named by the IAU in 2012.\n Within Ellington is the smaller crater Berkel.  The somewhat smaller crater Derain is to the northwest.",
  "/wiki/Duke_Ellington": "Edward Kennedy Duke Ellington (April 29, 1899 \u2013 May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades. Born in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase beyond category as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as jazz. Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges, are considered to be among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his pieces having become standards.",
  "/wiki/Eminescu_(crater)": "Eminescu is a peak ring crater on Mercury 125 kilometers (78 mi) in diameter. Since there are very few later craters superposed on it, Eminescu appears to be a young crater formed around one billion years ago. It has a transitional morphology between larger more complex impact basins like Raditladi and smaller simpler central peak craters. The impact ejecta and chains of secondary craters extend as far as one radius from the rim. There are no bright or dark crater rays, with the crater rim itself being higher in altitude than the surrounding cratered plains. The crater walls are degraded by slumping, forming distinct blocks of material. The crater floor consists of complex structures,  including ejecta deposits, impact melts and possibly units placed by effusive volcanism. The bright bluish central peaks within the crater are arranged in a circular pattern forming a peak ring.",

  "/wiki/List_of_craters_on_Mercury": "This is a list of named craters on Mercury, the innermost planet of the Solar System (for other features, see list of geological features on Mercury). Most Mercurian craters are named after famous writers, artists and composers. According to the rules by IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, all new craters must be named after an artist that was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for more than three years, before the date they are named. Craters larger than 250 km in diameter are referred to as basins (also see \u00a7 Terminology).\n As of 2019, there are 401 named Mercurian craters, a small fraction of the total number of named Solar System craters, most of which are lunar, Martian and Venerian craters.[a]\n Other, non-planetary bodies with numerous named craters include Callisto (141), Ganymede (131), Rhea (128), Vesta (90), Ceres (90), Dione (73), Iapetus (58), Enceladus (53), Tethys (50) and Europa (41).
