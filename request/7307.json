  "/wiki/List_of_longest-running_U.S._cable_television_series": "This is a list of the longest running United States cable television series, ordered by number of broadcast seasons.\n To qualify for this list, the programming must originate in North America and shown nationally in the United States and be first-run (as opposed to a repackaging of previously aired material or material released in other media). For the purposes of this list, series that were available only on a local or regional basis will be excluded. For series that originated on U.S. broadcast networks (or broadcast syndication) and then was picked up by a national cable network, only the amount aired nationally on cable as original programming is represented here."
