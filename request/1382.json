  "/wiki/List_of_French_football_champions": "The French football champions are the winners of the highest league of football in France, Ligue 1. Since the National Council of the French Football Federation voted in support of professionalism in French football in 1930, the professional football championship of France has been contested through Ligue 1, formerly known as Division 1 from 1933\u20132002. \n Prior to this, the first division championship of French football was contested through a league ran by the Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques (USFSA), an organization that supported amateur sport. The USFSA's league ran from 1894 to 1919 and awarded 22 league titles before being suspended in 1915 due to World War I and the creation and success of the Coupe de France, which had quickly become the country's national competition. The USFSA returned in 1919 changing the league into numerous regional amateur leagues that awarded no league title. This system lasted from 1919 to 1926. In 1926, the first division's reins were handed over to the French Football Federation. The federation organized and ran a league composed of the regional amateur league champions called the Championnat de France amateur from 1927 to 1929 and awarded three titles before the league was converted to the professional league that exists today in 1932.\n The first champions of French football were Standard Athletic Club, who defeated The White Rovers 2\u20130 in Courbevoie on 6 May 1894. The initial championship match was held on 29 April but finished 2\u20132, so the match was replayed. Standard went on to win the French championship four more times over the next seven years before RC Roubaix took control of the league becoming the first French club to win three straight titles beginning in 1902. Following Roubaix's success, the ownership of the amateur league title began rotating back and forth from the north of France to the south of France with Marseille eventually winning the last amateur title in 1929.\n The first French football champions of the professional era were Olympique Lillois, a predecessor of Lille, who defeated Cannes 4\u20133 on 14 May 1933 at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. S\u00e8te were crowned champions the following season and, in 1939, became the first professional club in France to win two titles. Following the conclusion of World War II, Saint-\u00c9tienne became the model club of the country winning four consecutive titles from 1966 to 1970. The club won all its 10 titles in a span of 25 years. Marseille repeated Saint-\u00c9tienne's feat of four consecutive titles from 1988 to 1992. It would take the club another 17 years to win another title. During the hiatus between Marseille's title in 1992 and the club's most recent in 2010, Lyon established themselves as a top club winning their first title in 2002. The title started a national record-breaking streak of seven successive league championships with the streak coming to an end following the 2008\u201309 season when Bordeaux eclipsed them winning their sixth title.\n Saint-\u00c9tienne and Marseille have the most titles in French football having won ten each. The majority of Saint-\u00c9tienne's titles came during the 1960s and 1970s when the club was led by managers Jean Snella, Albert Batteux, and Robert Herbin. Marseille has nine professional league titles and one amateur title which they won in the 1928\u201329 season. The club initially equalled Saint-\u00c9tienne's number of titles won during the 1992\u201393 season, but the title was stripped after it was discovered by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) that the club's president Bernard Tapie had bribed the opposition's players. Tapie was later found guilty of bribery and sentenced to two years in prison. In the 2009\u201310 season, Marseille equalled Saint-\u00c9tienne's number of titles, amateur or professional. As of 2019, Nantes , Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain third with eight titles, followed by Lyon with seven."
