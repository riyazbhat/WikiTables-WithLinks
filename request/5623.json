  "/wiki/Shenyang": "Shenyang ([\u0282\u0259\u0300n.ja\u030c\u014b]; Chinese: \u6c88\u9633), formerly known as Fengtian (Chinese: \u5949\u5929; pinyin: F\u00e8ngti\u0101n) or by its Manchu name Mukden, is a major sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Liaoning province, People's Republic of China. Located in central-north Liaoning, it is the province's most populous city as well as the largest city in Northeast China by urban population, with an urban population of 6.3 million (2010 census), while the total metropolitan population is up to 8.1 million. Shenyang is also the central city of one of the major megalopolises in China, the Greater Shenyang Metropolitan Area, with a total population over 23 million. The city's administrative region includes the ten metropolitan districts of Shenyang proper, the county-level city of Xinmin, and two counties of Kangping and Faku. In the 17th century, Shenyang was conquered by the Manchu people and briefly used as the capital of the Qing dynasty. The Battle of Mukden took place in 1905 as part of the Russo-Japanese War. Japan's subsequent victory allowed them to annex the region west of the old city and increase their influence on Shenyang; the Mukden Incident led the Japanese to further invade and occupy the rest of Northeast China, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold, but was captured by the Communists in 1948 after the Liaoshen Campaign.",
