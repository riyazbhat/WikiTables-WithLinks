  "/wiki/Georg_Hackl": "Georg Hackl (born 9 September 1966) is a German former luger who was three time Olympic and World Champion. He is known affectionately as Hackl-Schorsch or as the Speeding Wei\u00dfwurst a reference to what he looks like in his white bodysuit coming down the luge at fast speeds.\n Hackl was born in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria. He took up luge as part of his physical education lessons whilst at school, learning to slide at the K\u00f6nigssee track.\n Hackl was known for his rivalry with Markus Prock, with Prock being dominant in World Cup competition whilst Hackl consistently achieved success at the Winter Olympics. Although Hackl was not as natural an athlete as Prock, he was noted as being extremely skilled at setting up his sled to suit particular ice conditions on a given day. In addition his coach and former luger Thomas Schwab highlighted Hackl's mental strength as being key to his success.\n He won his first Winter Olympic Games luge medal in 1988 in Calgary, when he finished second in the singles event, while placing fourth in the doubles. Four years later, he improved his performance to win the gold, a feat he repeated in 1994 and 1998. In 1998, he won the gold by clocking the fastest time in all four runs, the first in Olympic history in the men's singles to do so (Vera Zozula of the Soviet Union did that feat in the women's singles event at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York). That year he was named as German Sportsman of the Year. Hackl won the silver medal again in the 2002 Games, becoming the first Winter Olympian to win a medal in five consecutive Winter Olympics. Most recently, he placed 7th in the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n Hackl has retired from active participation and got involved in coaching after the 2006 Winter Olympics. He is responsible for a group of German lugers nicknamed the \"Sunshine Training Group\", alongside Patric Leitner, with Hackl having responsibility for their sleds. Members of the group include Felix Loch, Natalie Geisenberger, Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt, who between them took a clean sweep of the gold medals in luge at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n Hackl won a total of 22 medals at the FIL World Luge Championships, including ten golds (Men's singles: 1989, 1990, 1997; Mixed team: 1991, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), ten silvers (Men's singles: 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 2001, 2004, 2005; Men's doubles: 1987, Mixed team: 1996, 1997), and two bronzes (Men's singles: 2000, Mixed team: 1999).\n At the FIL European Luge Championships, Hackl won twelve medals.

  "/wiki/Uwe-Jens_Mey": "Uwe-Jens Mey (born 13 December 1963) is a former speed skater, considered to be the fastest sprinter of his time because of his 500 metres supremacy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was born in Warsaw, Poland.\n Originally competing for East Germany (and after the German reunification for Germany), Mey's first notable achievement was in December 1983. At the age of 19, he outpaced Andr\u00e9 Hoffmann in the 500 metres and by doing so, Mey earned the East German title and a ticket to the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. There, Mey finished 8th on his favourite 500 metres distance.\n In the years after the Sarajevo Olympics he stood firm in the international sprinting sub-top, making step-by-step progression. At the World Sprint Championships, he finished 6th, 5th and 4th, respectively, in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Finishing second behind Dan Jansen in the overall standing of the first distances World Cup in 1986, Mey established himself at the 500 metres world top. Mey was a true perfectionist, training very hard to improve his technique. During the mid-1980s, he was considered to be the fastest starter in the world.\n One week before the start of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, he finished second in the World Sprint Championships, behind a supreme Dan Jansen. This made Jansen the favourite for both the 500 and the 1,000\u00a0m. But because of a family tragedy (his sister died from leukemia just hours before the start of the 500\u00a0m), Jansen turned out to be mentally incapable of sprinting a perfect race; on both distances, Jansen fell. But it still remains doubtful if Jansen would have been able to beat Mey that day; the East German raced perfectly, faster than anyone had ever raced before. His opening time on the first 100\u00a0m of the 500\u00a0m was 9.76 and he finished in a new world record time of 36.45, a legendary record that would stand firm for four years.\n Four days after his legendary 500\u00a0m race, Mey started as an outsider for winning the 1,000\u00a0m as well. Though not his favourite distance, Mey again skated very fast; his time of 1:13.11 was a new personal record, one he would never beat in his later career. With this time, he outpaced the 1,000\u00a0m favourite, Igor Zhelezovski, by 8 hundredths of a second, but Mey wound up finishing in second place, just behind another outsider, the World Allround Champion Nikolay Gulyayev. One month later, Mey won his first 500 metres Overall World Cup. By repeating this achievement during the following the three years, he proved his 500 metres supremacy. He also won the Overall World Cup in his less favoured distance, the 1,000 metres, in 1989 and 1990.\n At the World Sprint Championships, he was less successful. In 1989, in Heerenveen, he finished second behind Igor Zhelezovski. In 1990, he did not rank himself because of a fall, and in 1991, he finished second once again behind \"Igor the Terrible\". In January 1992, in Davos, he broke his own legendary world record, setting it at 36.43, but one week later, it was broken by Dan Jansen. That established Jansen and Mey as the two favourites for the 500\u00a0m at the 1992 Winter Olympics. In Albertville, Jansen did not get his revenge for Calgary: Mey outpaced him and all the other sprinters in the field once again, thereby retaining his Olympic gold medal. This turned out to be his last official race.\n Mey retired from top speed skating with 2 Olympic gold medals, 1 Olympic silver medal, 4 silver World Championship Sprint medals, 48 World Cup victories, 6 Overall World Cup wins, and 2 world records.\n After his skating career Mey became a salesman.",
