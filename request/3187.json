His next two releases The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002) were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. As a result of being a leading figure in a form of black music, Eminem was subject to comparisons to Elvis Presley at the time. After the release of Encore in 2004, which faced heavy criticism by fans and critics for its lackluster quality, Eminem went on hiatus in 2005 partly due to a prescription drug addiction. He released Relapse in 2009 and Recovery the following year, which both won Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album. Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, making it his second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2,  Revival, Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By.\n Eminem starred in the drama film 8 Mile (2002) playing a fictionalized version of himself, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", making him the first hip hop artist to ever win the award. He has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series Entourage (2010). Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.\n Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States in the 2000s.

  "/wiki/21_(Adele_album)": "21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008\u201309 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n Adele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\n Praised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history. In addition, it had the most weeks on the Billboard 200 chart of any album by a woman. It was certified Diamond by the RIAA and was ranked as the \"Greatest Billboard 200 Album of All Time.\"\n Five singles were released to promote the album, with \"Rolling in the Deep,\" \"Someone like You\" and \"Set Fire to the Rain\" becoming international number-one songs, while \"Rumour Has It\" charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America. Globally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalise lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, 21 is one of the best-selling albums of all time and the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year.",

  "/wiki/1989_(Taylor_Swift_album)": "1989 is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 27, 2014, through Big Machine Records. Following the release of her fourth studio album Red (2012), which critics considered Swift's emergence from her trademark country styles to straightforward pop, Swift sought to completely move away from country. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, she enlisted a production team whose key figures included herself, Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder, and Jack Antonoff, who shaped the album's overall 1980s-styled sonic coherence. Martin and Swift served as the album's executive producers.\n Titled after Swift's birth year, 1989 is a synth-pop record that uses heavy synthesizers, programmed percussion, and processed background vocals. While the album is primarily about reflections on past romantic relationships, Swift's recurring theme, it presents more mature and wistful perspectives, expressing self-discovery. Critical reaction to 1989 was generally positive; the pop production polarized reviewers, but Swift's songwriting received mostly favorable responses. The album was included in the top ten in year-end lists issued by publications including Billboard, Rolling Stone, and Time. It won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 58th Grammy Awards, making Swift the first female solo artist to win the former category twice.\n The album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.287 million copies, making Swift the first artist to have three million-selling albums within first week of release in the country.
