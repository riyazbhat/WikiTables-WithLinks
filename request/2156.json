  "/wiki/Part_of_Me_(Katy_Perry_song)": "\"Part of Me\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry, released as the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection. It was written by Perry, and Bonnie McKee, with production and additional writing by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. The song was not included on the original edition of Teenage Dream because Perry felt that it did not fit the composition of the album. A demo of the song leaked online in late 2010, amid speculation that the lyrics were directed to the singer's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy. \"Part of Me\" was re-worked and officially released on February 13, 2012, through Capitol Records with artwork by art director Gavin Taylor and photography by Mary Ellen Matthews.\n A dance-pop and power pop song with a distinctive house beat, it has been compared to Perry's 2010 singles \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\". Its lyrics describe a female protagonist who declares herself as unbreakable and strong following a break-up. Many critics theorized that the lyrics addressed Perry's divorce from Russell Brand, although Perry stated it was not about him since it was written in early 2010.\n \"Part of Me\" was a commercial success. It was the twentieth song to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, Perry's seventh number-one single on the chart, and her ninth consecutive number-one single on the Billboard  Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The single debuted at number-one in Canada and the United Kingdom and has been certified Platinum in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Marketing campaigns for Adidas and The Sims 3: Showtime have featured it.\n An accompanying music video was filmed at the United States Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, California.

Perry debuted the first televised performance of song on at the 54th Grammy Awards and has also performed the song at the ECHO Awards, the 2012 Kids' Choice Awards, and American Idol.",
