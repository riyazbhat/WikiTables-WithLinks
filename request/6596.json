There are a number of rules specifying what is included in the urban fringe, but it generally consists of contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile. Urbanized Areas often form the cores of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and as they comprise census tracts rather than local political subdivisions (counties, in Florida), they are generally smaller than the corresponding Metropolitan Statistical Area.
