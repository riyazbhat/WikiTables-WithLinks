  "/wiki/Association_football_positions": "In the sport of association football, each of the 11 players on a team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play. A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive, midfield, and attacking positions depending on the formation deployed. These positions describe both the player's main role and their area of operation on the pitch. In the early development of the game, formations were much more offensively aggressive, with the 1\u20132\u20137 being prominent in the late 1800s. In the latter part of the 19th century, the 2\u20133\u20135 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this. In defence, there were full-backs, known as the left-back and right-back; in midfield, left-half, centre-half and right-half; and for the forward line there were outside-left (or left wing), inside-left, centre-forward, inside-right and outside-right (or right wing). As the game has evolved, tactics and team formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game (though some old familiar ones remain). The term half-back fell out of use by the early 1970s and midfield was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield.",

  "/wiki/Forward_(association_football)": "Forwards are the players on a football (soccer) team who play nearest to the opposing team's goal, and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals. Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players. Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards; for example, the common 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation includes one forward. Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards, or none.",
