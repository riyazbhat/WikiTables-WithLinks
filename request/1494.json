  "/wiki/Matthew_Carter": "Matthew Carter (born 1 October 1937) is a British type designer. A 2005 New Yorker profile described him as 'the most widely read man in the world' by considering the amount of text set in his commonly used fonts. Carter's career began in the early 1960s and has bridged all three major technologies used in type design: physical type, phototypesetting and digital font design, as well as the design of custom lettering. Carter's most used fonts are the classic web fonts Verdana and Georgia and the Windows interface font Tahoma, as well as other designs including Bell Centennial, Miller and Galliard. He is the son of the English historian of printing Harry Carter (1901-1982) and cofounded Bitstream, one of the first major retailers of digital fonts. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",

  "/wiki/Dead_History": "Dead History is a typeface which explores combining structural elements of both geometric sans-serif and Didone serif typefaces. Designed in 1990 by P. Scott Makela, the face is licensed by Emigre. Dead Historys strokes transition from unbracketed serifs and contrasting stroke width on the left side of characters to a mono-weighted sans-serif with soft, rounded terminals on the right. Max Kismans 1991 typeface FF Fudoni, a combination of Futura and Bodoni elements is a similar exploration.",
  "/wiki/P._Scott_Makela": "P. Scott Makela (1960-May 7, 1999) was a graphic designer, multimedia designer and type designer. Among other work, he was especially noted for the design of Dead History, a postmodern typeface (issued by the Emigre digital type foundry) that combined features of a rounded sans serif typeface and a crisp neo-classical serif typeface. With the emergence of the personal computer in the mid-1980s, Makela was among the first to explore digital programs such as Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. As a result, he created an idiosyncratic, original and highly controversial design aesthetic. In particular, his disregard for clean, modernist, problem-solving design agendas - synonymous with contemporary corporate graphic design - caused much debate among powerful, old-guard designers such as Massimo Vignelli, Paul Rand, and Henry Wolf. Makela graduated from Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1985. He developed a notable body of work of graphics, film and industrial soul music before his sudden death at the age of 39 in May 1999. Commercial yet highly personal, Makela created visually aggressive work for clients such as Apple Computer, Rossignol, Nike and Sony. Projects such as Michael Jackson's Scream and film titles for the seminal Fight Club defined a post-modern moment in graphic design, along with the work of contemporaries such as April Greiman and David Carson. In 1996, Makela and partner and wife, Laurie Haycock Makela became designers-in-residence and co-directors of the graduate program in Graphic Design at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, where they also ran their studio, Words + Pictures for Business + Culture. Together with writer Lewis Blackwell they authored Whereishere (Ginko Press) an unprecedented print-website concept that broke from the orthodox approach to understanding two dimensional design. As a passionate snowboarder and mountain biker, Makela epitomized and expressed early 1990s American youth culture.",

FF Meta has been adopted by numerous corporations and other organizations as a corporate typeface, for signage or in their logo. These include Imperial College London, The Weather Channel, Free Tibet, three television stations in upstate New York, Herman Miller, Zimmer Holdings, Mozilla Corporation, Mozilla Foundation, Schaeffler Group and Fort Wayne International Airport.

  "/wiki/Interstate_(typeface)": "Interstate is a digital typeface designed by Tobias Frere-Jones in the period 1993-1999, and licensed by Font Bureau. The typeface is based on Style Type E of the Highway Gothic series of fonts, a signage alphabet drawn for the United States Federal Highway Administration by Dr. Theodore W. Forbes in 1949. Frere-Jones' Interstate typeface, while optimal for signage, has refinements making it suitable for text setting in print and on-screen, and gained popularity as such in the 1990s. Due to its wide spacing, it is best suited for display usage in print. Frere-Jones later designed another signage typeface, Whitney, published by Hoefler & Co., that bears a resemblance to its ancestor while being less flamboyant and more economical for general print usage, in body copy, or in headlines. The terminals of ascending and descending strokes are cut at an angle to the stroke (see lowercase t, and l), and on curved strokes (see lowercase e and s), terminals are drawn at a 90\u00b0 angle to the stroke, positioning them at an angle to the baseline. Counters are open, even in the bold and bold condensed weights, further contributing to legibility. Punctuation is based on a rectangular shape, while official FHWA punctuation is based on a circular shape.",

  "/wiki/Galliard_(typeface)": "Galliard is the name of a serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter and issued in 1978 by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. Galliard is based on the sixteenth-century type of Robert Granjon. According to Alexander Lawson, The name Galliard stems from Granjon's own term for an 8-point font he cut about 1570. It undoubtedly refers to the style of the face, for the galliard was a lively dance of the period. Explaining what drew him to Granjon's work, Carter wrote on some of his more characteristic letterforms: looking at them, adjectives like 'spirited, 'tense' and 'vigorous' come to mind...it is easy to admire Granjon's work. Mike Parker, Director of Typographic Development at Mergenthaler Linotype, had been inspired by seeing the types of Granjon at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp. Matthew Carter, who joined Mergenthaler Linotype as a typeface designer in 1965, was also an admirer. His father, Harry Carter, had worked to itemise the Museum's extensive collection of sixteenth-century punches and matrices in the 1950s, with his son occasionally helping. Work continued on the typeface, sporadically, through the 1960s and 1970s. The typeface was released in 1978. With a glittering, crisp design, Galliard has been used both for body text and for headings. Galliard is notable for its 'pelican-beak' letter 'g', based on Granjon's Double Pica italic of 1570.",
