It was created in 2008 from a merger of the Shire of Esk and the Shire of Kilcoy. It is commonly known as the Brisbane Valley, due to the Brisbane River which courses through the region, although significant parts of the region lie outside the hydrological Brisbane Valley itself. The Esk and Kilcoy Shires were amalgamated to consolidate the water catchments for the Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams. The Local Government Reform Commission identified that the long-term future of Somerset would be as a major water catchment for the SEQ region with farming being the main economic activity within a water catchment management regime. The planning strategy and land use policies implemented by the Somerset Regional Council are therefore directed this end. The Somerset Regional Council, which administers the region, has an estimated operating budget of A$50 million. (Council's 2011/2012 budget adopted in June 2012 showed total operating revenue of A$50,049,250).",
