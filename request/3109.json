It includes Grand Island, Kearney, Hastings, North Platte, Alliance, and Scottsbluff. Additionally, it encompasses a large majority of the Platte River(s). Nebraska has had at least three congressional districts since 1883. The district's current configuration dates from 1963, when Nebraska lost a seat as a result of the 1960 United States Census. At that time, most of the old 3rd and 4th districts were merged to form the new 3rd District. The district is one of the most Republican districts in the nation. Democrats have only come close to winning this district three times as currently drawn, in 1974, 1990, and 2006, all years where the incumbent was not running for reelection. Republican presidential and gubernatorial candidates routinely carry the district with margins of 40 percent or more, while Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win a plurality within the current district boundaries. Excepting historically Democratic Saline County on the districts eastern boundary and Dakota County which has only been within this district since 2013, the last Democrat to carry any county within the district at a presidential level was Jimmy Carter in 1976. Although Nebraska's state legislature is elected on a nonpartisan basis, all but two state senators representing significant portions of the district are known to be Republicans. With a Cook PVI of R+27, it is the most Republican Congressional District in the country outside the South.",

From statehood in 1890 to the 1910 election, Idaho was represented by a statewide at-large seat. Following the 1910 census, Idaho gained a second House seat; it was first contested in 1912.

The 2012 election cycle saw the district remain largely in the shape it has had since the 1950s, encompassing the western third of the state. Historically, it has been reckoned as the Boise district, as it usually included most of the state capital. The latest round of redistricting, however, saw the 1st pushed to the west, shifting almost all of its share of Boise to the 2nd district. A significant increase in population directly west of Boise over the previous decade, in western Ada and Canyon counties, was responsible for the westward shift of the boundary.
