  "/wiki/South_East_Queensland": "South East Queensland (SEQ) is a bio-geographical, political, and administrative region of the state of Queensland in Australia, which contains more than 3.6 million people out of the state's population of 5.1 million. The area covered by South East Queensland varies, depending on the definition of the region, though it tends to include Queensland's three largest cities: the capital city Brisbane; the Gold Coast; and the Sunshine Coast. Its most common use is for political purposes, and covers 22,420 square kilometres (8,660\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and incorporates 11 local government areas, extending 240 kilometres (150\u00a0mi) from Noosa in the north to the Gold Coast and New South Wales border in the south (some sources include Tweed Heads (NSW) which is contiguous as an urban area with Brisbane/Gold Coast), and 140 kilometres (87\u00a0mi) west to Toowoomba (which is simultaneously considered part of the Darling Downs region).\n South East Queensland was the first part of Queensland to be settled and explored by Europeans. Settlements initially arose in the Brisbane and Ipswich areas with activity by European immigrants spreading in all directions from there.  Various industries such as timber cutting and agriculture quickly developed at locations around the region from the 1840s onwards.  Transport links have been shaped by the range of terrains found in South East Queensland.\n The economy of South East Queensland supports and relies on a wide diversity of agricultural manufacturing industries, commerce and tourism. The region has an integrated public transport system, TransLink.",
  "/wiki/Shire_of_Albert": "The Shire of Albert was a local government area in Queensland, located south of the capital, Brisbane, and taking in areas to the north and west of the Gold Coast. It was named after the Prince Consort of the United Kingdom, and husband of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert. When created in 1948, it was primarily a rural area, but its growth started in earnest in the late 1960s with the development of Logan on Brisbane's southern frontier. After the separate creation of Logan as a shire (later City) in 1978, Albert lost most of its population and became more centred upon the Gold Coast, which experienced a massive period of growth from then until the Shire's amalgamation with the City of Gold Coast in 1995.",

  "/wiki/Shire_of_Redland": "Redland City, better known as the Redlands and formerly known as Redland Shire, is a local government area located in the southeast of the Brisbane metropolitan area in South East Queensland. With a population of 156,863 in June 2018, the City is spread along the southern coast of Moreton Bay, covering 537.2 square kilometres (207.4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Its mainland borders the City of Brisbane to the west and north-west, and Logan City to the south-west and south, while its islands are situated north of the City of Gold Coast.\n Redland attained city status on 15 March 2008, having been a shire since 1949, when it was created by the merger of the former Tingalpa and Cleveland Shires. Despite this status, the City consists of largely suburban and coastal communities, featuring a somewhat disjointed urbanisation around major suburbs interspersed with bushland; there is no clear city centre.\n Large mainland suburbs include Capalaba, Cleveland, Victoria Point, and Redland Bay. The latter is the City's namesake, due to the colour of its fertile soil. North Stradbroke Island and smaller nearby islands, most notably those of Southern Moreton Bay, comprise the eastern portion of the Redlands. The City's boundaries correspond to those of the federal division of Bowman.",

Determining the size and shape of the local government areas is the sole responsibility of the Queensland Government.\n In the past, many local government areas (especially in South East Queensland and the Darling Downs region) have been amalgamated or abolished, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The most significant of these processes took place in March 2008, when 97 local government areas and 20 indigenous councils were amalgamated under a statewide reform process \u2014 until this time, the majority of Queensland's local government areas had remained unchanged for decades and some even dated back to the establishment of local government for regional areas in 1879."
