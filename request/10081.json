  "/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle": "The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), also commonly called Caretta Caretta, is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures around 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) in carapace length when fully grown.  The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135\u00a0kg (298\u00a0lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450\u00a0kg (1,000\u00a0lb).

No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females.",
