  "/wiki/Jack_FM": "Jack FM is a radio network branding licensed by Sparknet Communications to media outlets in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The stations that adopt this branding play a very broad mix of songs from the late 1960s to the 2000s, along with some current adult contemporary/hot adult contemporary singles.\n Jack's slogan \"playing what we want\" is also considered to be as more of a motto or philosophy of their programming. They promote themselves as having a larger and more varied playlist than most other commercial radio stations. It is not unusual for a Jack FM station to have a playlist of 700 to 2000 songs, while other FM radio stations may have playlists of fewer than 500 songs. Jack FM stations do not accept song requests from listeners. The format has also been likened to an MP3 player set on shuffle mode.  The stations that have the Jack FM format are in most cases officially classified as \"adult hits\" or \"variety hits\" by radio research companies.",
  "/wiki/102.2_Jazz_FM": "102.2 Jazz FM (also known as London Jazz Radio and JFM) was a local jazz and soul music station for London run by GMG Radio. The station was based in and broadcast from Castlereagh Street in London. The station experimented with its core playlist over its fifteen-year history, incorporating smooth jazz, mainstream jazz, soul, jazz fusion, acid jazz, blues and rhythm and blues. In 1994 the station changed its name to JFM to encourage more listeners who were put off by the 'Jazz' in the station's name. Richard Wheatly was appointed in 1995 to turn the station around when there was only three months' money left to run the station. Wheatly made a number of sweeping changes to the playlist, selling a sister station and changing the name back to Jazz FM, as well as starting up a record label and spin-off business deals and opportunities which helped Jazz FM swing into the black and make a profit in 2001. In July 2002, after a relaxation in ownership rules from the publication of the Communications Bill, the Guardian Media Group's radio division was able to purchase the station for \u00a344.5 million. GMG made more changes to the playlist, shifting to more R&B, soul, easy listening and adult contemporary music during the daytime.",
