The music contrasts Japanese contemplation (There is No Other Way) with Western ingenuousness (Please Hello) while over the course of the 127 years, Western harmonies, tonality and even lyrics are infused into the score. The score is generally considered to be one of Sondheim's most ambitious and sophisticated efforts.
