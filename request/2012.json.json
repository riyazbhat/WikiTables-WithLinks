  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.",

  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis.",

  "/wiki/GE_C39-8": "The GE C39-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems between 1984 and 1987.  It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40C": "The GE C40-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems between 1987 and 1992. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives, and its wheel arrangement is of a C-C type.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40CM": "The GE C40-8M is a 6-axle diesel locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems from 1990 to 1994. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives, and is often referred to as a Dash 8-40CM.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40CW": "The GE C40-8W is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems from 1989 to 1994. Often referred to as a Dash 8-40CW, it is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. This locomotive model is distinguished from the predecessor Dash 8-40C by the addition of a newer \"wide\" or \"safety\" cab. A cowl-bodied version of this locomotive, built only for the Canadian market, was the GE Dash 8-40CM.",

  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-44CW": "The GE C44-8W is a 4,400\u00a0hp (3,280\u00a0kW) diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems of Erie, Pennsylvania. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. They are considered to be pre-production Dash 9s with the innards of it but trapped in an extended Dash 8 carbody as well as having the trucks. They are numbered 9000-9052. The first three were originally supposed to be the last order of Dash 8s for CSX thus having the smaller Dash 8 carbody. They have been derated to 4000 horsepower and are now designated C40-9W."
