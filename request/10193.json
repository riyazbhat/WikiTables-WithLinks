The Olympic sport of athletics is split into four distinct sets of events: track and field events, road running events, and racewalking events. Both men and women had very similar schedules of events. Men competed in 24 events and women in 23, as their schedule lacked the 50 km race walk. In addition, both the men's 110 m hurdles and decathlon are reflected in the women's schedule by the 100 m hurdles and heptathlon, respectively. The Olympic record was broken in 17 returning events. In five events, including the inaugural women's 3000 m steeplechase, the world record was broken. The athletics was, alongside the Olympic cycling events, one of the few large sports programmes in which the host nation fared comparatively poorly in terms of medals won.",

IOC president Jacques Rogge also criticized Bolt's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied that this was the purpose of his mid-race celebration by saying \"I wasn't bragging.
