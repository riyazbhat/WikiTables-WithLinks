The city lies on a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provides a natural defence system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung. The Dutch first established tea plantations around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital Batavia (180 kilometres (112 miles) to the northwest). In the early 20th century the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (gemeente), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed Parijs van Java (Dutch: The Paris of Java). After Indonesia declared independence in 1945, the city experienced has experienced ongoing development and urbanisation, transforming from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km2 (per square kilometre) metropolitan area with living space for over 8 million people.

  "/wiki/Minahasa": "The Minahasans (alternative spelling: Minahassa or Mina hasa) are an ethnic group located in the North Sulawesi province of Indonesia, formerly known as North Celebes. The Minahasa people sometimes refer to themselves as Manado people. Despite the fact that the Minahasan pre-Christian creation myth entails some form of ethnic unification, before the nineteenth century the Minahasa region was in no way unified. Instead, a number of politically independent groups (walak) existed together, often in a permanent state of war. Minahasans are the most populous ethnic group in the Minahasan peninsula of North Sulawesi. They are a Christian-majority region in a country (Indonesia) with a Muslim majority. The indigenous inhabitants of Minahasa are Austronesian people who are the descendants of earlier migrations from further North. Prior to contact with Europeans, people living in the Minahasan peninsula primarily had contact with inhabitants from North Maluku and with Chinese and Malay traders from within the Indonesian archipeligo. From the 1500s onwards, the region had contact with the Portuguese and Spanish. Ultimately however, it was the Dutch who colonized the region; firstly through the actions of the Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie 'Dutch East Indies Company' (VOC) and, from 1817 onwards, through the administration of the Dutch nation state. There are nine languages which are indigenous to the Minahasan peninsula. All languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, and five of these (Tondano, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tontemboan, and Tonsawang) comprise the Minahasan microgroup, while three (Bantik, Toratan, and Sangir) are part of the Sangiric group.",
