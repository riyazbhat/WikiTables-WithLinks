  "/wiki/WWA_World_Heavyweight_Championship_(Mexico)": "The WWA World Heavyweight Championship (Campeonato Mundial Peso Completo WWA in Spanish) is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship promoted by the Mexican Lucha Libre wrestling based promotion World Wrestling Association (WWA) since 1986. As the Championship was designated as a heavyweight title, the Championship can only officially be competed for by wrestlers weighing at least 105\u00a0kg (231\u00a0lb). However, as with most heavyweight titles the \"minimum\" weight requirement is often ignored.\n As it was a professional wrestling championship, the championship was not won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match determined by the bookers and match makers.[a] On occasion the promotion declares a championship vacant, which means there is no champion at that point in time. This can either be due to a storyline,[b] or real life issues such as a champion suffering an injury being unable to defend the championship,[c] or leaving the company.[d]\nBill Anderson was the first champion, defeating Tinieblas in the finals of a tournament on October 4, 1986. Perro Aguayo is the wrestler that has held the championship the most times, three, Mil Mascaras is the only other wrestler to have won the title more than once. The current champion is Rayo de Jalisco, Jr., having defeated Rey Misterio, Sr. in a tournament final on March 21, 2003. Since the WWA titles have been largely unsanctioned since the late 1990s it means that they can be defended on any wrestling show, not just limited to WWA promoted shows.[e]",

It is one of the most important cultural and financial centres in the world. It is located in the Valley of Mexico (Valle de M\u00e9xico), a large valley in the high plateaus in the center of Mexico, at an altitude of 2,240 meters (7,350\u00a0ft). The city has 16 alcald\u00edas, formerly known as boroughs.\n The 2009 population for the city proper was approximately 8.84 million people, with a land area of 1,485 square kilometers (573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). According to the most recent definition agreed upon by the federal and state governments, the population of Greater Mexico City is 21.3\u00a0million, which makes it the second largest metropolitan area of the Western Hemisphere, the eleventh-largest agglomeration (2017), and the largest Spanish-speaking city in the world.\nGreater Mexico City has a GDP of $411 billion in 2011, making Greater Mexico City one of the most productive urban areas in the world. The city was responsible for generating 15.8% of Mexico's GDP, and the metropolitan area accounted for about 22% of total national GDP. If it were an independent country, in 2013, Mexico City would be the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, five times as large as Costa Rica and about the same size as Peru.\n Mexico's capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by indigenous people, the other being Quito, Ecuador. The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards. In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was established, known as M\u00e9xico Tenochtitl\u00e1n, and as of 1585, it was officially known as Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (Mexico City). Mexico City was the political, administrative, and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire. After independence from Spain was achieved, the federal district was created in 1824.\n After years of demanding greater political autonomy, residents were finally given the right to elect both a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by election in 1997. Ever since, left-wing parties (first the Party of the Democratic Revolution and later the Movimiento de Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional) have controlled both of them. The city has several progressive policies, such as abortion on demand, a limited form of euthanasia, no-fault divorce, and same-sex marriage.\n On 29 January 2016, it ceased to be the Federal District (Spanish: Distrito Federal or D.F.) and is now officially known as Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (or CDMX), with a greater degree of autonomy. A clause in the Constitution of Mexico, however, prevents it from becoming a state within the Mexican federation, as it is the seat of power in the country, unless the capital of the country were to be relocated elsewhere.",

It is part of the San Diego\u2013Tijuana transborder urban agglomeration and the larger Southern California megalopolis. As the 6th-largest city in Mexico and center of the 6th-largest metro area in Mexico, Tijuana exerts a strong influence in education and politics \u2013 across Mexico, in transportation, culture and art \u2013  across all three Californias (the U.S. state of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur), and in manufacturing and as a migration hub \u2013 across the North American continent. Currently one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Mexico, Tijuana maintains GaWC 'sufficiency city' status. As of 2015[update], the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,641,570.\n Tijuana is located on the Gold Coast of Baja California, and is the municipal seat and the cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality (Mexican states are divided into municipalities, rather than counties as in the U.S.). Tijuana covers 70% of the territory of the municipality and contains 80% of its population. A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent, the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century,  Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America. Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca. The city is the most visited border city in the world; sharing a border of about 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year. This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the fourth busiest land-border crossing in the world. It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone.[citation needed]\n Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico.  According to the 2015 census, the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico, with a population of 1,840,710, but rankings vary, the city (locality) itself was 6th largest and the municipality (administrative) 3rd largest nationally.  The international metropolitan region was estimated at about 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego.\n Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American occupation of the Mexican capital ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded on July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its supposed initials, T.J., and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.",

It was named after Nezahualcoyotl, the Acolhua poet and king of nearby Texcoco, and was built on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco. The name Nezahualc\u00f3yotl comes from Nahuatl, meaning \"fasting coyote.\"\n Until the 20th century, the land on which Ciudad Neza sits was under Lake Texcoco and uninhabited. Successful draining of the lake in the early 20th century created new land, which the government eventually sold into private hands. However, public services such as adequate potable water, electricity and sewerage were lacking until after the area was made an independent municipality in 1963. Today Ciudad Neza is a sprawling city of over one million entirely with modern buildings.\n As of 2006, Nezahualc\u00f3yotl included part of the world's largest mega-slum, along with Chalco and Izta. Most of its population is poor and have migrated from other parts of Mexico. It also has a very high crime rate, in part due to \"cholos\" or gangs formed since the 1990s based on gang models in the United States, especially Los Angeles. Since the 2000s, a significant number of natives of this city have immigrated to the United States, mostly settling in New York. This has led to a new Mexican subculture in the area.\n The city and municipality is named after the Aztec King Nezahualc\u00f3yotl. The entity has an Aztec glyph as well as a coat of arms. The glyph depicts the head of a coyote, tongue outside the mouth with a collar or necklace as a symbol of royalty. It was one of the ways of depicting the Aztec king. The current coat of arms, which includes the glyph, was authorized by the municipality in the 1990s.  The municipality comprises its own intrastate region, Region IX (Mexico State).",

Octagoncito's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. In addition to working for AAA Octagoncito has also worked for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Lucha Libre USA, World Wrestling Federation (WWE), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and a slew of smaller wrestling promotions. Working in the Mini division does not necessarily mean that Octagoncito has dwarfism, as short wrestlers can also work in the \"Mini\" division.",
  "/wiki/World_Wrestling_Association": "The World Wrestling Association (WWA) is a lucha libre promotion based in the Tijuana-area of Mexico. It was founded in 1986 by Benjamin Mora Jr.. It featured some of Mexico's best luchadores at the time, such as Rey Mysterio Jr., La Parka and Juventud Guerrera, during the late 1980s and early 1990s and was also featured on American television via the Fox Sports en Espa\u00f1ol channel.\n Although inactive during the late 1990s, during which time much of its roster had left to compete in World Championship Wrestling and international promotions, the World Wrestling Association resumed operations in 2004."
