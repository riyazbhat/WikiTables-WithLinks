It is a member of the Japonic (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family, and its relation to other languages, such as Korean, is debated. Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu, Austroasiatic, and the now-discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance.",
  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana (\u4eee\u540d, Japanese pronunciation:\u00a0[kana]) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system, contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji (\u6f22\u5b57). The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries: cursive hiragana (\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a) and angular katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca). Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana (\u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d), which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana. Hentaigana (\u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d, \"variant kana\") are historical variants of modern standard hiragana. In modern Japanese, hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds.",

More specifically, it refers to the Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. Hanja-mal or Hanja-eo (the latter is used more often) refers to words that can be written with Hanja, and hanmun (\ud55c\ubb38, \u6f22\u6587) refers to Classical Chinese writing, although \"Hanja\" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts.
