  "/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions": "In the sport of Australian rules football, each of the eighteen players in a team is assigned to a particular named position on the field of play. These positions describe both the player's main role and by implication their location on the ground. As the game has evolved, tactics and team formations have changed, and the names of the positions and the duties involved have evolved too. There are 18 positions in Australian rules football, not including four (sometimes 6\u20138) interchange players who may replace another player on the ground at any time during play.\n The fluid nature of the modern game means the positions in football are not as formally defined as in sports such as rugby or American football. Even so, most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career, as each position requires a particular set of skills. Footballers who are able to play comfortably in numerous positions are referred to as utility players.",

  "/wiki/Ruckman_(Australian_rules_football)": "In Australian rules football, a ruckman or ruckwoman is typically a tall and athletic player who contests at centre bounces and stoppages (such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups).   The ruckman is one of the most important players on the field.  They are often key to coaching strategy and winning centre clearances which result in the most goal kicking opportunities (inside 50s).\n The role of the ruckman in Australian rules is similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out.  The key differences are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins, the ball is almost always thrown straight up high into the air rather than horizontally, so in this respect, the ruckman is similar to a basketball centre.  The ruckman needs to be able to control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms.  Unlike rugby, the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates. Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman.\n With no offside or knock on rules, the ruckman can tap the ball in any direction.  Before a bounce down or ball up, ruckmen confer with the onballers (rovers and ruck-rovers) to pre-determine the direction of the tap so that they can position themselves to best receive it to the team's advantage.\n The ruckman is typically the tallest player on either team.  A typical professional Australian Football League ruckman is over 200\u00a0cm or 6'7.\n When a ruckman beats his opponent by contacting the ball, it is called a hit out and measured as a statistic and performance indicator of effective ruckwork.   Although the ruckman is the primary player to score hit-outs, sometimes tall key position players fill in for the ruckman around the ground if the ruckman cannot run to make the contest in time.\n Rucking is one of the most physically demanding positions on the ground, both in terms of fitness and body contact.  As a result of the high level of physical contact of clashing with opponents in the air, many ruckmen have large physiques or bulk up to prevent injury.  As well, due to the use of knees when jumping, many ruckmen wear protective thigh and shin padding, whereas players in other positions rarely do.  Coaches often field more than one ruckman and rotate them due to the physical pressure of the position and the endurance of having to run to ruck contests around the ground.",

  "/wiki/Sharrod_Wellingham": "Sharrod Wellingham (born 7 July 1988) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club and the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League (AFL).\n A pacy wingman from Western Australia, Wellingham became the fifth Indigenous footballer on the Magpies list having been selected with the 10th pick in the 2006 AFL Rookie Draft.\n Wellingham's initial season at the club was spent with Collingwood's VFL affiliate side, Williamstown. Due to VFL limits on the number of AFL-listed players eligible for selection against non AFL-affiliated clubs, Wellingham was demoted to the Williamstown reserves towards the end of 2007. Despite this Wellingham was promoted to the Collingwood senior list to replace Chris Egan. Despite being named an emergency in round 19 against Richmond, he did not make his Collingwood debut in 2007 and was subsequently demoted back to 'rookie' status. He survived the cut post-season, and remained on the Collingwood 2008 rookie list. He then switched guernsey numbers, switching from the lowly 41 to Guy Richards' old number 21.\n In January 2008, Collingwood lost their sponsorship from the Transport Accident Commission after Wellingham was charged with drink-driving. Wellingham was moving a car 100 metres up the road (so he says, the other AFL players with him had been drinking) after being out on Saturday 5 January, when he was pulled over by the police. The club fined him $5000.\n Before the 2008 Anzac Day Clash between Essendon and Collingwood he was promoted to the senior list again and was initially named as an emergency, but made his debut when Anthony Rocca was unable to play due to injury.\n After 2008, Wellingham went on to entrench himself as a vital member of Collingwood's midfield. His pace, footskills, overhead marking and ferocity at the contest became valuable assets to the Magpies' side.\n He played in the 2010 grand final-winning team.\n He put himself in the spotlight with a career-best 37 possessions in the 2011 Queen's Birthday game against Melbourne, where he stood up in the absence of a number of star teammates to lead Collingwood to a dominant 88 point win.\n On 6 July 2012, in a Friday night game against arch-rival Carlton, Wellingham laid a head-high bump on Carlton's Kade Simpson when Simpson was running back with the flight of the ball, attempting to take a mark. The Match Review Panel deemed the hit worthy of a five-match suspension, but due to Wellingham's five-year good record, the suspension was reduced to four weeks, and reduced a further 25% to three weeks due to an early guilty plea.\n At the end of the 2012 season during the AFL Trade Period, Wellingham was traded to the West Coast Eagles, Collingwood in return receiving the Eagles' first round pick, #17. His first season at the Eagles was marred by an ankle injury sustained while using a trampoline during the pre-season, while his second season, 2014, was limited by injury and poor form. He has, by his own admission, been lazy, and many Eagles supporters believe that his first two seasons at the club have not been worth the draft pick given up for him.\n In 2015, Sharrod proved that the Eagles had made the right decision to trade for him, playing a vital role in their astonishing climb up the ladder and Grand Final appearance under new coach Adam Simpson. He averaged 18 disposals and 4 marks in 24 games as a reliable midfielder/defender.\n Wellingham\u2019s life before his AFL debut was filled with education and family; attending Trinity College and Wesley. His mother, Aileen Walsh, and step father, David Bodeker, were his main supporters during his school years and, eventually, during his love for football. Wellingham is the only boy amongst his 5 siblings: Ester Wellingham, Katja Gvozdenovic, Hannah Wellingham, Ella Bodeker, and Asha Bodeker. Wellingham spent most of his time growing up with his devoted mother and step father and his three sisters, Katja, now 25, Ella, now 21, and Asha, now 19. Wellingham\u2019s father, Mark, a real estate agent, played a minor role in Wellingham\u2019s growing love for ALF but got on board once he realised how far Wellingham could take his passion. Wellingham now lives in Perth with his de-facto, Victoria Packer, working in sales and enjoying reflecting on his bright but short AFL career. \n Wellingham was delisted by West Coast at the end of the 2017 season.",
