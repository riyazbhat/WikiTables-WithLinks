  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols.[note 1] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position; alternatively, a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector.\nA common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and elevation.\nTo specify a location on a plane requires a map projection.",
  "/wiki/Zillergr%C3%BCndl_Dam": "The Zillergr\u00fcndl Dam is an arch dam on the Ziller River in the upper Ziller Valley of Tyrol state, Austria. It is 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) east of Mayrhofen. The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power production and it supports a 360 MW pumped-storage power station. As part of the Zemm-Ziller Development, construction on the dam began in 1981 and it along with the H\u00e4usling Pumped Storage Power Plant were complete in 1986. The power plant was fully commissioned by 1988. The dam is the second tallest in Austria.",

  "/wiki/Pumped-storage": "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing.  The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest.",

It was constructed between 1971 and 1979 and at 200 metres (660\u00a0ft) high, it is the tallest dam in Austria. The dam's reservoir serves as the primary storage in a three-stage pumped-storage power system that consists of nine dams, four hydroelectric power plants and a series of pipeline and penstocks. The complex is owned by Verbund power company and is referred to as the Malta-Reisseck Power Plant Group.

  "/wiki/Run-of-the-river": "Run-of-river hydroelectricity (ROR) or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided. Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage, in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage. A plant without pondage is subject to seasonal river flows, thus the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source. Conventional hydro uses reservoirs, which regulate water for flood control and dispatchable electrical power.",
