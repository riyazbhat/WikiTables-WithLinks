  "/wiki/T_Third_Street": "The T Third Street is a Muni Metro line in San Francisco, California.  It is the first new light rail line in San Francisco in more than half a century, and the first fully accessible line in the system. It is also the first true light rail line in the mostly streetcar Muni Metro system, as it operates mostly in a street median, rather than in mixed traffic.\n Testing on the line took place in summer 2006, with limited service starting on January 13, 2007, and full service beginning on April 7, 2007. It runs along the newly constructed light-rail tracks on Third Street and Bayshore Boulevard in the Visitacion Valley, Bayview/Hunters Point, Dogpatch, and Mission Bay neighborhoods, connecting to the existing Muni Metro system along the southern Embarcadero and below Market Street, and replaced the 15 Third bus line.\n In the future, the line may be extended to Caltrain's Bayshore Station (to which it was originally planned to run) and, in the other direction, to San Francisco's Washington Square in North Beach via Chinatown Central Subway alignment.",

  "/wiki/Balboa_Park_Station": "Balboa Park is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Muni Metro station complex located south of Balboa Park in southern San Francisco, California. It is an intermodal hub served by four BART routes, three Muni Metro lines, and a number of Muni bus routes. The station complex also includes two rail yards, Cameron Beach Yard and Green Light Rail Center, where Muni maintains Muni Metro trains and heritage streetcars. BART uses a below-grade island platform on the west side of the complex; Muni Metro routes use several smaller side platforms located on surface-level rail loops around the yards.\n The San Francisco and San Jose Railroad opened in 1863, with Elkton station located near the modern site. Passenger service on the line (later the Southern Pacific Railroad Ocean View Branch) ran until about 1922. Electric streetcar service at Balboa Park began in 1892 with the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway, which built a still-standing office building designed by Reid & Reid there in 1901. The United Railroads conglomerate built its Elkton shops on an adjacent parcel in 1907. In the 1960s, BART decided to use the Ocean View Branch right-of-way for part of a rapid transit system. The San Francisco portion of BART, including Balboa Park station, opened on November 5, 1973.\n Both streetcar facilities were replaced by modern yards in the 1970s and 1980s. Muni Metro service to the Balboa Park complex began with the K Ingleside line in 1979, followed by the M Ocean View line in 1980 and the J Church line in 1991. In the early 2000s, BART and Muni began planning renovations to improve the accessibility of the station and its connections to the surrounding neighborhoods. A new BART entrance was completed in 2011, followed by new Muni platforms in 2015 and 2017 and an additional footbridge in 2018. Additional improvements like more elevators and modernized headhouses are proposed. The 1901-built office building and an adjacent powerhouse, both abandoned since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, are planned to be renovated as a community center.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Muni_Metro_stations": "Muni Metro is a light rail/streetcar system serving San Francisco, California, United States. Operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), a part of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Muni Metro served an average of 166,900 passengers per weekday in the second quarter of 2013, making it the third-busiest light rail system in the United States.\n Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, and five of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are remnants of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT&T Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down the eastern side of the city to the city line.\n The system consists of nine subway stations and twenty-four surface stations with high-level 34-inch (860\u00a0mm) platforms that allow for level boarding. There are also eighty-seven surface stops whose features vary anywhere between low-level platforms, traffic islands, and  markers painted on nearby utility poles. Four stations, from Embarcadero to Civic Center, are shared with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The oldest stations are Forest Hill and West Portal, built in 1918, while the newest stations were opened as part as the Third Street Light Rail Project in 2007."
