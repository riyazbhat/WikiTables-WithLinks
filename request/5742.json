However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most.

W. Bush and winning a Grammy Award as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions.
