  "/wiki/Blurred_Lines": "\"Blurred Lines\" is a song by American singer-songwriters Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams and rapper T.I., produced by Williams. It was released on March 26, 2013, through Williams's label Star Trak Recordings as the lead single from Thicke's album Blurred Lines. Recorded in 2012, the drumming was inspired by the Marvin Gaye song \"Got to Give It Up\", and apart from T.I.'s rap, was entirely the work of Williams. However, Thicke claimed writing credits on the track, according to a Reuters article. The song became the subject of a bitter legal dispute with the family of Gaye and Bridgeport Music, who argued the song infringed on copyrights to the song that inspired it. Williams and Thicke were found liable for copyright infringement by a federal jury in March 2015, and Gaye was awarded posthumous songwriting credit (based on the royalties pledged to his estate).\n The song's music video was released in two versions: one featuring models Emily Ratajkowski, Jessi M'Bengue, and Elle Evans topless, while the other censored the nudity. The uncensored version of the video was removed from YouTube for violating the site's terms of service, but restored with an age restriction. As of January 2020, there is no age restriction on the uncensored music video.\n The lyrics and music video to \"Blurred Lines\" were controversial, with some groups claiming they are misogynistic and promote a culture of date rape. It was banned in the United Kingdom from some institutions and students' unions at universities. Thicke offered numerous rebuttals, but also called the song \"a bad joke\". Williams defended his song, saying the accusers were selectively picking apart the lyrics and the song was actually meant to empower women although Williams came to later regret working on the song. Video director Diane Martel said the music video was meant to be silly and provocative, and the women in it were meant to be overpowering the men.\n \"Blurred Lines\" peaked at number one in at least 25 countries and became the number one song of 2013 in several countries. It became Thicke's first, T.I.'s fourth, and Williams' third number-one single in the US, where it was also the longest running number one single for that year. It became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of 14.8 million, simultaneously breaking the record for the largest radio audience in history. The single was nominated for two Grammys at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. The song has been parodied and covered numerous times.",
