  "/wiki/Allentown_Union_Hall": "The Allentown Union Hall is a historic meeting hall located 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Illinois Route 121 in Allentown, Illinois. The building was built in 1892 to host community events in Allentown, a small rural settlement. Like many small communities nationwide at the turn of the century, the citizens of Allentown wished to expand their educational and cultural horizons; since rough dirt roads made travel outside the community difficult, the community used the hall to host its own cultural events. The Allentown Helping Hand Circle, the community organization that raised the money for the building, hosted many of the hall's early events, which included community dinners and talent shows. The hall also hosted shows put on both by actors and musicians from Allentown and the surrounding area and by traveling acts who stopped in the community. As the only large public building in the area, the town hall also served as a polling place, a clubhouse for women's clubs and fraternal organizations, a church for the community's religious groups, and an auditorium for the local school. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1988.",

  "/wiki/Ayer_Public_Library_(Delavan,_Illinois)": "The Ayer Public Library is a Carnegie library located at 200 Locust Street in Delavan, Illinois. The library was the city's fifth attempt at forming a library; it succeeded and assumed the collection of a library founded in 1902 by the Blue Button Army temperance organization. When the Blue Button library closed in 1907, supporter Amos K. Ayer called for the city to establish a permanent public library. With Ayer's financial backing, a library for all citizens of Delavan Township was approved the same year; however, it used a temporary space and lacked a permanent home until the city applied to the Carnegie Foundation for assistance in 1912. After a protracted misunderstanding with James Bertram, who expected a city library tax and did not understand that the township provided tax support, the Foundation provided a $10,000 grant for the library and construction began in 1914. The Classical Revival library opened later in the year; it remains open to this day. The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1998.",

It is located in northern Mason County. The nearest town is Manito, Illinois and the nearest numbered highway is U.S. Highway 136. It is located on a low bluff, or sand ridge, overlooking the Illinois River, hence the name. The sand ridge is believed to be an artifact of the post-glacial Kankakee Torrent. The Sand Ridge State Forest largely dates back to 1939, when the state of Illinois purchased parcels of submarginal sandy farmland for conservation purposes. The Civilian Conservation Corps planted pine trees on much of the land. Today, the 7,200-acre (2,900 ha) state forest contains 3,916 acres (1,585 ha) of dryland oak-hickory woodlands, 2,492 acres (1,008 ha) of pine woodlands, and 792 acres (321 ha) of open fields and sand prairies.

  "/wiki/Farm_Creek_Section": "The Farm Creek Section, also known as the Farmdale Geologic Exposure, is a hillside near East Peoria, Illinois that clearly showed geological strata. It is nationally significant as one of the first exposed glacial stratifications in the United States to be scientifically documented. These Ice Age geological formations, with rock layers representing different periods of glaciation, had long been known and published in England, France, and Germany, but were not yet well known in North America. Geologist Frank Leverett discovered this exposed face of a hill with its clearly defined stratifications in 1879 and described and pictured it in his monograph, The Illinois Glacial Lobe, in 1899. The Farm Creek publication gave a name to the Illinoian glaciation, the southernmost penetration of glacial ice into what was to become the Midwestern United States. It also helped formulate regional and national stratigraphic classifications and has figured prominently in the study and development of glacial geology. A 15-acre (6.1 ha) area of the Farm Creek Section was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The site is on the south side of Farm Creek (a tributary of the Illinois River) in the Farm Creek Recreation Area, south of Illinois Route 8 (Washington St.) and between School Street and Bittersweet Road, and is accessible by following an unpaved road, part of which is an abandoned right of way formerly in use by the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad. The formation is largely covered by a modern soil layer. Some erosion has occurred in the time since its initial discovery, but the layers of strata are still readily discernible.",

Very high voltage alternating current was converted to 600 volt direct current for use by the interurban line's locomotives and interurban cars. Wires entered and left through the large holes in the upper portions of the depot. The station was one of several properties owned by the IT at Mackinaw along with adjacent mainline track and a number of rail sidings, but the other buildings and the track have since been demolished leaving the depot as the only surviving landmark from the era of electric interurban trolley service in the central Illinois area.

The lock has a standard 100-by-600-foot (30 m \u00d7 183 m) chamber, similar to other locks on the river, and a vertical lift of 11 feet (3.4 m).
