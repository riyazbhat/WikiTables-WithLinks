Denton was widely known for enduring almost eight years of grueling conditions as an American prisoner of war (POW) in North Vietnam after the A-6 Intruder he was piloting was shot down in 1965. He was the first of all American POWs held captive and released by Hanoi to step off an American plane during Operation Homecoming in February 1973. As one of the earliest and highest-ranking officers to be taken prisoner in North Vietnam, Denton was forced by his captors to participate in a 1966 televised propaganda interview which was broadcast in the United States. While answering questions and feigning trouble with the blinding television lights, Denton blinked his eyes in Morse code, spelling the word \"TORTURE\"\u2014and confirming for the first time to U.S. Naval Intelligence that American POWs were being tortured. In 1976, Denton wrote When Hell Was in Session about his experience in captivity, which was made into the 1979 film with Hal Holbrook.",
  "/wiki/North_Vietnam": "North Vietnam, officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) (Vietnamese: Vi\u1ec7t Nam D\u00e2n Ch\u1ee7 C\u1ed9ng H\u00f2a), was a country in Southeast Asia from 1945 to 1976. During the August Revolution following World War II, Vietnamese communist revolutionary H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, leader of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, declared independence from French Indochina on 2 September 1945, announcing the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh (\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\") was a coalition of multiple Vietnamese nationalist groups, mostly led by communists who increasingly marginalized non-communists in the organisation after the reestablishment of the previously banned Communist Party of Vietnam in February 1951. France moved in to reassert its colonial dominance over Vietnam which led to the First Indochina War in December 1946, a bloody guerrilla war between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas in Vietnam which led to French defeat in 1954. The negotiations in the Geneva Conference that year ended the war and recognized Vietnamese independence. The Geneva Accords provisionally divided the country into a northern and a southern zone along the 17th parallel, stipulating general elections in July 1956 to \"bring about the unification of Viet-Nam\". The northern zone was controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and became commonly called North Vietnam, while the southern zone, under control of the French-established State of Vietnam was commonly called South Vietnam.",

Moreover, the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President. It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Center. The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries, such as Germany's BND.

These reforms were deeply unpopular among the more traditional rural population and established power structures.
