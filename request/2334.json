  "/wiki/CAMS_37": "The CAMS 37 was a flying boat built in France in the mid-1920s that was originally designed for military reconnaissance, but which found use in a wide variety of roles in a large number of versions.  It was the first design for Chantiers A\u00e9ro-Maritimes de la Seine (CAMS) by the company's new head designer, Maurice Hurel.  The prototype was displayed at the 1926 Salon de l'A\u00e9ronautique in Paris.  The prototype first flew in 1926, and after testing was ordered into service before the end of the year.  It was a conventional biplane flying boat very similar to previous CAMS designs, being driven by a pusher propeller whose engine was mounted on struts in the interplane gap.  The first production version was the amphibious CAMS 37A that was bought by the French Navy, the Portuguese Navy and the aeroclub of Martinique.",

It was one of the most widely used seaplanes of World War II. Catalinas served with every branch of the United States Armed Forces and in the air forces and navies of many other nations.\n During World War II, PBYs were used in anti-submarine warfare, patrol bombing, convoy escort, search and rescue missions (especially air-sea rescue), and cargo transport. The PBY was the most numerous aircraft of its kind, and the last military PBYs served until the 1980s. As of 2014, nearly 80 years after its first flight, the aircraft continues to fly as a waterbomber (or airtanker) in aerial firefighting operations in some parts of the world.",

At the time of its completion, it held the distinction of the largest aircraft to be built in France as well as being one of the first large passenger aircraft to be capable of flying trans-Atlantic routes.\n First flown on 10 January 1935, the Lat\u00e9 521 achieved several world records relating to payload and endurance. It was introduced to passenger service by national operator Air France, who was able to launch several previously-unattainable long distance passenger routes. As a civilian aircraft, the Lat\u00e9 521 was outfitted as a luxurious airliner, providing a high level of comfort for up to 72 passengers. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, the Lat\u00e9 521 were taken over by the French Navy, who typically operated the type as a long distance maritime patrol aircraft. None survived the conflict due to intentional sabotage by the retreating German forces. The Lat\u00e9 521 was the basis of the single Lat\u00e9 522 Ville de Saint Pierre civil airliner, and the three Lat\u00e9 523 navalized variants.",
  "/wiki/List_of_aircraft_of_World_War_II": "The List of aircraft of World War II includes all the aircraft used by those countries which were at war during World War II from the period between their joining the conflict and the conflict ending for them. Aircraft developed but not used operationally in the war are in the prototypes section at the end. Prototypes for aircraft that entered service under a different design number are ignored in favour of the service version. The date the aircraft entered service, or was first flown if the service date is unknown or it did not enter service follows the name, followed by the country of origin and major wartime users. Aircraft used for multiple roles are generally only listed under their primary role unless specialized versions were built for other roles in significant numbers. Aircraft used by neutral countries such as Spain, Switzerland and Sweden or countries which did no significant fighting such as most of those in South America (except Brazil), are not included."
