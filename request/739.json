  "/wiki/Abbott-Holloway_Farm": "The Abbott\u2013Holloway Farm contains a couple of the few early structures still standing in Bethlehem, Indiana, located in the extreme northeast section of Clark County, Indiana.  It overlooks the Ohio River.\n The land comprising the Abbott\u2013Holloway Farm was first owned by Jonathan Clark, one of the early founders of Bethlehem in 1812.  The primary building on the lot is believed to have been built in 1830 by Asa Abbott; records destroyed by the Ohio River flood of 1937 makes the exact date unknowable.  When first built it was used as a store and post office, as Abbott was the postmaster for the town.  Abbott is also believed to be the builder of the farm that also still stands.  Due to fires and tornados, these buildings are among the few buildings constructed before 1840 still standing in Bethlehem; only two other houses still stand from the time.\n After Abbott died in 1873, control of the town went to his widowed daughter Athenatia (Abbott) Ross.  With her 1885 marriage to Missouri man Fleming Holloway, they and his children moved to the farm.  During their time of ownership several more barns were placed on the property, but most of those structures were destroyed in a tornado during the 20th century.  Upon Athenatia's 1899 death, Fleming gave up the house to his son Barnes Holloway, and moved to a smaller house on the property.  In 1939 the farm was sold to Ira Church.  Its modern owners acquired it in 1988 and turned it into a bed and breakfast.\n The structures of the property include a main house, two sheds, and a privy.  The main house is Federal two-story double-pile brick house with a one-story extension.  It features a central passage, twin end chimneys, and side gable roof.  Many of its doors are paneled wood with limestone lintels.  The house was named in 1992 by the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana among the ten most significant buildings in Clark County.  The barn on the property is of a transverse-frame timber construction that has been converted for guest housing.\n It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, two years after its HLFI designation and one year after the local historical preservation group, the Historic Bethlehem Inc., was founded.",
  "/wiki/Ohio_River": "The Ohio River is a 981-mile (1,579\u00a0km) long river in the United States.  It is located in the midwestern United States, flowing southwesterly from western Pennsylvania south of Lake Erie to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois. It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States. The river flows through or along the border of six states, and its drainage basin includes parts of 15\u00a0states.  Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River, the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of drinking water for three million people.\n The lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the water level falls 26\u00a0ft. in 2 miles and is impassible for navigation.  The McAlpine Locks and Dam, a shipping canal bypassing the rapids, now allows commercial navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico.\n The name \"Ohio\" comes from the Seneca, Ohi:yo', lit.\u00a0\"Good\u00a0River\". European discovery of the Ohio River may be attributed to English explorers from Virginia in the latter half of the 17th century. In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781\u201382, Thomas Jefferson stated: \"The Ohio is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted.\"  In the late 18th century, the river was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory.  It became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S.\n The river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason\u2013Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland, and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South. Where the river was narrow, it was the way to freedom for thousands of slaves escaping to the North, many helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement.\n The Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville. At Paducah, Kentucky, in the south, near the Ohio's confluence with the Mississippi, it is ice-free year-round.",

With nearby Falls of the Ohio as the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site.
