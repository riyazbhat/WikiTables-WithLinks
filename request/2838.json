The league realigned itself into three divisions in each conference. The Southeast Division began with five inaugural members, the Hawks, the Bobcats, the Heat, the Magic and the Wizards. The Hawks joined from the Central Division, while the Heat, the Magic and the Wizards joined from the Atlantic Division. The Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets effective with the 2014\u201315 season, after which it assumed the history of the original Hornets from 1988\u20132002. The Hornets name was previously used by the now-New Orleans Pelicans from 2002\u20132013."
