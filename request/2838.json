  "/wiki/Miami_Heat": "The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami. The Heat compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division. The Heat play their home games at American Airlines Arena, and have won three NBA championships.\n The franchise began play in the 1988\u201389 NBA season as an expansion team. After a period of mediocrity, the Heat would gain relevance during the 1990s following the appointment of former head coach Pat Riley in the role of team president. Riley would construct the high-profile trades of Alonzo Mourning in 1995, and of Tim Hardaway in 1996, which immediately propelled the team into playoff contention. Mourning and Hardaway would eventually lead the Heat to four division titles, prior to their departures in 2001 and 2002, respectively. As a result, the team struggled, and entered into a rebuild in time for the 2002\u201303 season.\n Led by Dwyane Wade, and following a trade for former NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Shaquille O'Neal, Miami advanced to play in the NBA Finals in 2006, where they clinched their first championship, led by Riley as head coach. After the departure of O'Neal two years later, the team entered into another period of decline for the remainder of the 2000s. This saw the resignation of Riley as head coach, who returned to his position as team president, and was replaced by Erik Spoelstra.\n In 2010, after creating significant cap space, the Heat partnered Wade with former league MVP LeBron James, and perennial NBA All-Star Chris Bosh, creating the \"Big Three\". During their four-year spell together, and under the guise of Spoelstra, James, Wade, and Bosh, they would lead the Heat to the NBA Finals in every season, and won two back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. The trio would all depart by 2016, and the team entered another period of rebuilding. Wade was eventually reacquired in 2018, albeit to retire with the franchise.\n The Heat hold the record for the NBA's third-longest winning streak, 27 straight games, set during the 2012\u201313 season. Four Hall of Famers have played for Miami, while James has won the NBA MVP Award while playing for the team.",

Tim Duncan was named Finals MVP.\n The NBA Finals marked the first time since 1987 that the 2 previous champions met in the Finals (the Spurs won in 2003, the Pistons in 2004). For the Spurs, it was their 3rd title (they also won in the lockout-shortened season of 1999).\n The Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards ended long playoff droughts in 2005 (and met each other in the first round). For Washington it was their first playoff appearance since 1997 (and even more ironic their opponents for that postseason appearance were the Bulls who swept them on their way to their fifth NBA title), and only their third since 1988. Their 4-2 series victory over the Bulls was their first since 1982.\n The Miami Heat became the first team to go 8-0 through the first 2 rounds (the first round having been made into a best-of-7 in the 2003 NBA playoffs). The 2009 Cavaliers, 2010 Magic, 2012 Spurs, 2016 Cavaliers, 2017 Cavaliers and the 2017 Warriors followed suit.

In 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team to go 8-0 through the first two rounds and make the NBA Finals. In 2017, the Golden State Warriors became the second team to go 8-0 through the first two rounds and make the NBA Finals as well as going 16-1 in the playoffs, the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA Playoff history.\n It was the Bulls' first post-Michael Jordan playoff appearance, as their last playoff game was Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. They consistently placed at or near the bottom of the Central Division in between, but their 47-35 season in 2005 was a 24-game improvement from 2004.\n For the 3rd straight year (5th overall) the Pacers met the Celtics in the first round. Boston won in 2003 4\u20132, while Indiana swept Boston in 2004. It would be Boston's last playoff appearance until 2008.\n For the Los Angeles Lakers, it marked the first time in 11 seasons (dating back to 1994) and the fifth time in NBA history that they missed the playoffs.  This is also the most recent time that the playoffs were played entirely outside of Los Angeles.\n This was the last time that the Seattle SuperSonics would be in the playoffs before they relocated to Oklahoma to become the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n The Phoenix Suns won their first playoff series since 2000 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1993, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.\n Until 2019, This was the last NBA playoffs not to feature LeBron James as a player as his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the playoffs.",

Game 2 was a high-scoring affair that the Lakers ultimately won on both strong defensive play and last minute heroics by Bryant, Derek Fisher, and Pau Gasol during the overtime. A record-breaking performance from the Magic's 65% team shooting ensured the team a Game 3 win and the first Finals victory in franchise history.

  "/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks": "The Atlanta Hawks are an American professional basketball team based in Atlanta. The Hawks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division. The team plays its home games at State Farm Arena.\n The team's origins can be traced to the establishment of the Buffalo Bisons in 1946 in Buffalo, New York, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL) owned by Ben Kerner and Leo Ferris. After 38 days in Buffalo, the team moved to Moline, Illinois, where they were renamed the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. In 1949, they joined the NBA as part of the merger between the NBL and the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and briefly had Red Auerbach as coach. In 1951, Kerner moved the team to Milwaukee, where they changed their name to the Hawks. Kerner and the team moved again in 1955 to St. Louis, where they won their only NBA Championship in 1958 and qualified to play in the NBA Finals in 1957, 1960 and 1961. The Hawks played the Boston Celtics in all four of their trips to the NBA Finals. The St. Louis Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968, when Kerner sold the franchise to Thomas Cousins and former Georgia Governor Carl Sanders.\n The Hawks currently own the second-longest drought (behind the Sacramento Kings) of not winning an NBA championship at 60 seasons. The franchise's lone NBA championship, as well as all four NBA Finals appearances, occurred when the team was based in St. Louis. Meanwhile, they went 48 years without advancing past the second round of the playoffs in any format, until finally breaking through in 2015. However, the Hawks are one of only four NBA teams that have qualified to play in the NBA playoffs in 10 consecutive seasons in the 21st century. They achieved this feat between 2008 and 2017. The other teams that have made it to at least 10 consecutive playoff appearances in the 21st century are the San Antonio Spurs (1998\u2013present), Denver Nuggets (2004\u20132013), and Dallas Mavericks (2001\u20132012).",
