  "/wiki/Human_Nature_(Michael_Jackson_song)": "\"Human Nature\" is a 1982 song by American singer Michael Jackson, and the fifth single from his sixth solo album, Thriller. The track was produced by Quincy Jones and performed by members of Toto with Michael Jackson providing vocals.\n It was originally written by keyboardist Steve Porcaro, based on a conversation he had with his young daughter Heather after a boy pushed her at school, Porcaro said \"he probably likes you and it's human nature\".
