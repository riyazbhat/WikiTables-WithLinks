  "/wiki/Cathedral_Valley_Corral": "The Cathedral Valley Corral was constructed around 1900 by local cattlemen in the northern portion of what is now Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. It is one of the oldest examples of ranching use in the park. It coincided with a change in the use of the land, where cattle were grazed on the open range and collected into corrals for branding, vaccination and other procedures. The extensive use of open-range grazing practices led to the de-vegetation of portions of the area. The corral was used by the Jeffery and Morrel families. The corral site uses sandstone cliffs as part of the enclosure, with a wood fence closing off an alcove in a cliff. The pen is subdivided into a larger and smaller enclosure, with a cattle chute off the small pen.\n The Cathedral Valley Corral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1999.",

  "/wiki/Capitol_Reef_National_Park": "Capitol Reef National Park is an American national park in south-central Utah. The park is approximately 60 miles (97\u00a0km) long on its north\u2013south axis and just 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) wide on average. The park was established in 1971 to preserve 241,904 acres (377.98\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 97,895.08\u00a0ha; 978.95\u00a0km2) of desert landscape and is open all year, with May through September being the highest visitation months.\n Partially in Wayne County, Utah, the area was originally named \"Wayne Wonderland\" in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman. Capitol Reef National Park was designated a national monument on August 2, 1937, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to protect the area's colorful canyons, ridges, buttes, and monoliths; however, it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public. Road access was improved in 1962 with the construction of State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon.\n The majority of the nearly 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) long up-thrust formation called the Waterpocket Fold\u2014a rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powell\u2014is preserved within the park. Capitol Reef is an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River. The park was named for its whitish Navajo Sandstone cliffs with dome formations\u2014similar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildings\u2014that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. Locally, reef refers to any rocky barrier to land travel, just as ocean reefs are barriers to sea travel.",
