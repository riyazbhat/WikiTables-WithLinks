Portugal's golden generation helped Portugal reach the semi-finals of Euro 2000, losing 2\u20131 after extra time to eventual winners France, securing the second place at Euro 2004 Final after losing to Greece on home soil, as well reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup losing to finalist France, after a penalty, leading Portugal to secure the fourth place in the tournament, after losing to 3\u20131 to hosts Germany, thus being the best result since the 1966 World Cup. Despite losing many players of the golden generation, new players such as F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Nani and Pepe helped the Portuguese reach the semi-finals of Euro 2012, losing to Spain in penalties, with Cristiano Ronaldo finishing as joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals.",
