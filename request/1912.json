  "/wiki/Masonic_Temple_and_Lodge_(Alameda,_California)": "The Masonic Temple and Lodge are two adjacent Masonic buildings in downtown Alameda, California. The older Masonic Temple at 1329\u201331 Park St was built from 1890 to 1891. The building was designed in the Victorian Eclectic style and features brick pier which extend above the roof line, a tower on the south side of the roof, and an arched stone entrance with carved doors.\n The newer Masonic Lodge adjacent to the original temple at 2312 Alameda Ave is a Spanish Renaissance building constructed in 1927, and was added to provide both an auto parking lot on the ground floor, and an elevator to all four floors of the building that had only previously been accessible by stairs. The building features decorative carvings which adorn its entrances, archways, cornices, and window surrounds, and features two lodge rooms side by side, allowing both Masons and Eastern Stars to meet at the same time, as well as a full kitchen and dining room on the top floor. The Large Lodge Room features a built-in wheel of stained glass emblems in the symbolic East, allowing the room to be quickly changed from a Blue Lodge to the emblem of other frequent renters with a turn of the wheel, as well an organ loft with trap door to a Room of Contemplation, and a passage with multiple hidden doors to the lodge rooms for use in Appendant Body ceremonies. Two of the original stained glass windows from the front of the Park Street face of the Masonic Temple were removed before its sale and are now displayed in the Small Lodge Room of the currently active Masonic Lodge.\n Oak Grove Lodge #215 (originally located in the Temple and then later moving to the Lodge) helped build the city's first school and the First Methodist Episcopal Church. Prominent members of lodges which met in the building have included U.S. congressmen Joseph R. Knowland and William Knowland, poet Joaquin Miller, and eight of Alameda's mayors.\n Because the name \"Alameda Masonic Lodge\" was already taken by #163 in Fremont, CA (the Fremont Lodge is adjacent to Alameda Creek), \"Island City Masonic Lodge\" is the modern name of Masonic Lodge #215 today in the city of Alameda (which continues to use the number #215 in honor of Oak Grove Lodge). The modern street entrance to the Lodge is not on Park Street, but at 2312 Alameda Ave, Alameda, CA. Originally the first floor of the building was the member's car parking lot, but the car entrances have since been glassed in and become home to the Alameda Museum. Informal meetings are Thursday nights 6pm, with the fancier \"Trestleboard\" dinner the first Thursday of each month. Alameda Oak Leaf #8, the co-ed Order of the Eastern Star, also meets at the Alameda Masonic Temple, as does the Oakland Council No. 12 Cryptic Masons of the Oakland York Rite, an advanced masonic order open only to regular Master Masons of the Grand Lodge of California, and Pharos Lodge, an irregular co-ed masonic lodge not under the authority of the Grand Lodge of California and not in communication with first three regular masonic bodies in the same building.\n The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.",

In 1839, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mexican governor of Alta California, granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to Swiss-born Mexican citizen John Augustus Sutter, who subsequently established Sutter's Fort and the settlement at the Rancho Nueva Helvetia. Following the American Conquest of California and the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed, and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento. As a result of the California Gold Rush, Sacramento became a major commercial center and distribution point for Northern California, serving as the terminus for the Pony Express and the First Transcontinental Railroad.\n Sacramento is the fastest-growing major city in California, owing to its status as a notable financial center on the West Coast and as a major educational hub, home of California State University, Sacramento and University of California, Davis. Similarly, Sacramento is a major center for the California healthcare industry, as the seat of Sutter Health, the world-renowned UC Davis Medical Center, and the UC Davis School of Medicine, and notable tourist destination in California, as the site of The California Museum, the Crocker Art Museum, the California State Railroad Museum, the California Hall of Fame, the California State Capitol Museum, and the Old Sacramento State Historic Park. Sacramento International Airport, located northwest of the city, is the city's major airport. Sacramento is known for its evolving contemporary culture, dubbed the most \"hipster city\" in California. In 2002, the Harvard University Civil Rights Project conducted for Time magazine named Sacramento \"America's Most Diverse City\".",

The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. San Francisco's status as the West Coast's largest city peaked between 1870 and 1900, when around 25% of California's population resided in the city proper.

In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, significant immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the \"hippie\" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines.\n A popular tourist destination, San Francisco is known for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, Fisherman's Wharf, and its Chinatown district.
