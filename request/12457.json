  "/wiki/Confederate_Monument_in_Lawrenceburg": "The Confederate Monument in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky is an 8-foot-tall (2.4 m) figure which was built in 1894 by the Kentucky Women's Monumental Association, a predecessor of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, an organization founded in that year. Its governing body is the government of Lawrenceburg. It shows a Confederate soldier dressed in a winter coat with a rifle held vertically before him. Around the pedestal of the monument may be found the names of the Confederate regiments raised in Anderson County and a list of those men wounded or killed during the war. There were a few Civil War skirmishes at Lawrenceburg, The Battle of Lawrenceburg and the Battle of Dog Walk, just before the Battle of Perryville in October 1862. In particular, the Union Ninth Kentucky Cavalry fought the Confederate cavalry under Colonel Scott on October 6, 1862. Confederate troops that would control Frankfort had marched through the town. In later years, the local area saw guerrilla warfare, which force the creation of a Union Home Guard unit in the town.",
