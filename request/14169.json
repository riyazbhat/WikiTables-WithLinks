  "/wiki/Marlowe_(film)": "Marlowe is a 1969 American American neo-noir film  starring James Garner as Raymond Chandler's private detective Philip Marlowe. Directed by Paul Bogart, the film was written by Stirling Silliphant based on Chandler's 1949 novel The Little Sister. The supporting cast includes Bruce Lee, Gayle Hunnicutt, Rita Moreno, Sharon Farrell, Carroll O'Connor and Jackie Coogan. The film foreshadowed James Garner's second Los Angeles P.I. character Jim Rockford in The Rockford Files. Rita Moreno would also go on to co-star as a recurring character in the series. Many of the wisecracking Marlowe lines incorporated by Silliphant for this movie were taken directly from Chandler's novel. Silliphant is best known for his Academy Award-winning screenplay for In the Heat of the Night (1967) and creating the television series Route 66 and Naked City.",

  "/wiki/Enter_the_Dragon": "Enter the Dragon is a 1973 martial arts film produced by and starring Bruce Lee. The film, which co-stars John Saxon and Jim Kelly, was directed by Robert Clouse.

A joint American and Hong Kong production, it premiered in Los Angeles on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee's death and went on to gross US$90 million worldwide, equivalent to US$518 million adjusted for inflation.\n Enter the Dragon is widely regarded as one of the greatest martial arts films of all time. In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Among the first films to combine martial arts action with the emerging Blaxploitation genre, its success led to a series of similar productions combining both genres.\nIts themes have also generated scholarly debate about how they reflect the changes taking place within post-colonial Asian societies following the end of World War II.",

Bruce Lee died some years before the production of Game of Death II and most of his scenes are taken from Lee's older films; mostly from Enter the Dragon.  Aside from the International English dub giving the \"Bruce Lee\" character the name \"Billy Lo\", this movie would seem to have no connection with Robert Clouse's film.\n Famed martial arts star Billy Lo is murdered.

  "/wiki/Bruce_Lee": "Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: \u674e\u632f\u85e9; November 27, 1940 \u2013 July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee (Chinese: \u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d), was a Hong Kong-American actor, director, martial artist, martial arts instructor, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. The son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen, Lee was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco, California, on November 27, 1940, to parents from Hong Kong, and was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle, and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s."
