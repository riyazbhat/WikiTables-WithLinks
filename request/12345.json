  "/wiki/Fort_Mountain_(Murray_County,_Georgia)": "Fort Mountain is a mountain in northern Georgia, just east of Chatsworth.  It is part of the Cohutta Mountains, a small mountain range at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains.  It also lies within the Chattahoochee National Forest.\n Fort Mountain takes its name from a peak that has remnants of a stone formation around part of that peak. The stones, which are from the local area around the summit, are piled in a 928 feet (283 m)-long discontinuous zig-zag line. Stone piles may be formed naturally by the thrust that causes a ridge to crest during the mountain's formation.\n Early visitors referred to the formation as a fort, speculating that it was built by Hernando de Soto to defend against the Creek Indians around 1540. However, this theory was contradicted as early as 1917, as a historian pointed out that de Soto was in the area for less than two weeks.\n The original construction and function of the formation as a fort is less accepted today and its origin remains unknown. The structure is believed to have been crafted by pre-Columbian Native Americans. Early historians attributed the stone piles to a race of moon-eyed people, said to predate the Cherokee. The earliest known mention of this was by Benjamin Smith Barton (1766-1815).\n Around and mostly south of the fort peak is Fort Mountain State Park, with camping and hiking areas, a mountain lake, and a variety of public facilities.",
