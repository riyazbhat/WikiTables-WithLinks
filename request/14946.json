The lower defining point, 0\u00a0\u00b0F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice, water and a salt (ammonium chloride). Further limits were established as the melting point of ice (32\u00a0\u00b0F) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature (96\u00a0\u00b0F, about 2.6\u00a0\u00b0F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale).
