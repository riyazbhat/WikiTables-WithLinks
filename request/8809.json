A middle linebacker, he played eleven seasons in the National Football League (NFL), all with the Minnesota Vikings, and college football at Stanford University.\n Siemon grew up in Bakersfield, California, and graduated from Bakersfield High School in 1968, where he played QB, LB, TE, and Center.",
  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker (LB or backer) is a playing position in gridiron football.  Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \"back up the line\". Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \"two-point stance\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \"three-point stance\" or \"four-point stance\" before the ball is snapped).\n The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed. Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing. A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap. When a blitz is called by the defense, it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense's quarterback.\n Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense, due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense, when required. Similar to the \"free safety\" position, linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap, to determine their role during that particular play.",
  "/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_football": "The Stanford Cardinal football program represents Stanford University in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference's North Division. Stanford has a highly successful football tradition. The team is currently known as the Cardinal, adopted prior to the 1982 season. Stanford was known as the \"Indians\" from 1930 to January 1972, and the \"Cardinals\" from 1972 through 1981. A student vote in December 1975 to change the nickname to \"Robber Barons\" was not approved by administrators.\n Stanford has fielded football teams every year since 1892 with a few exceptions. Like a number of other teams from the era concerned with violence in the sport, the school dropped football in favor of rugby from 1906 to 1917. The school also did not field a team in 1918 (due to World War I) or in 1943, 1944, and 1945 (due to World War II).\n The school participated in the first-ever Rose Bowl against Michigan in 1902, in which they were routed 49-0. Its annual Big Game against California is the oldest and most storied rivalry in the Pac-12 and western United States. The Cardinal also compete for the Legends Trophy against independent rival Notre Dame.\n The program has an all-time record of 657\u2013467\u201349 for a winning percentage of .581 and has winning series records against all of its Pac-12 North rivals, except for the Washington Huskies, against whom they are tied 43\u201343\u20134. According to the Stanford Football media guide, the all-time series records against the rest of the Pac-12 North are: California, 64\u201347\u201311; Oregon, 49\u201333\u20131; Oregon State 58\u201325\u20133; Washington State 40\u201329\u20131.</ref> Stanford claimed national championships in 1926 and 1940. In 1926, led by legendary coach Glenn \"Pop\" Warner, the team was undefeated in the regular season and tied Alabama in the 1927 Rose Bowl. The 1940 team went unbeaten and untied after defeating Nebraska 21\u201313 in the 1941 Rose Bowl, but the team ranked #2 in the final AP poll released before the game was played.\n Pop Warner's era predated the AP poll, but Stanford has finished at least one season in the Top 10 in six different decades under seven different coaches: Claude E. Thornhill in 1934, Clark Shaughnessy in 1940, Chuck Taylor in 1951, John Ralston in 1970 and 1971, Bill Walsh in 1992, Jim Harbaugh in 2010, and David Shaw in 2011, 2012, and 2015.  Coach Shaw, as of the 2017 season, has the most wins of any Stanford coach in history. Stanford's most recent season finish in the top 5 was in 2015 after the #5 Cardinal dismantled Big Ten West Division Champion #6 Iowa Hawkeyes 45\u201316 in the 2016 Rose Bowl to finish with a record of 12\u20132 (Stanford's third 12-win season ever, after 2010 and 2012) and a final ranking of #3 in the final AP Poll and the final Coaches Poll (Stanford's highest AP Poll ranking since 1940 and its highest Coaches Poll ranking ever).\n The Cardinal have played in 30 bowl games in their history, including 17 appearances in bowls now comprising the College Football Playoff, specifically 15 Rose Bowls (the third-most appearances of any team, behind only USC's 33 appearances and Michigan's 22),[citation needed] the 2011 Orange Bowl, and the 2012 Fiesta Bowl.\n Quarterback Jim Plunkett is the only Stanford player to win the Heisman Trophy, doing so in 1970. Stanford players have finished second in Heisman voting six times: quarterback John Elway was second to Herschel Walker in 1982; running back Toby Gerhart was second to Mark Ingram in 2009; quarterback Andrew Luck finished second to Cam Newton in 2010 and to Robert Griffin III in 2011; running back Christian McCaffrey finished second to Derrick Henry in 2015; and running back Bryce Love finished second to Baker Mayfield in 2017.",
