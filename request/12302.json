  "/wiki/Jackson_Mound": "The Jackson Mound is a Native American mound in the south-central portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located north of Pancoastburg in Fayette County, it measures approximately 75 feet (23\u00a0m) in diameter and 5.5 feet (1.7\u00a0m) in height.

If true, it was originally more conical in shape (the mound's location in a farm field has resulted in its being damaged by years of plowing), and it is likely to cover the remains of a wooden charnel house built by the Adena.",
