  "/wiki/Sydney_Swans": "The Sydney Swans are a professional Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). Established in Melbourne as the South Melbourne Football Club in 1874, the Swans relocated to Sydney in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside Victoria. Initially playing in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896. It won premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933 before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought\u2014the longest in the competition's history. The club broke the drought in 2005 and won another premiership in 2012. The club has proven to be one of the most consistent teams in the AFL era, failing to make the finals in only four seasons since 1995, playing the most number of finals matches and winning the second-most matches overall (only behind Geelong) since 2000 and boasting a finals winning record of over 50% in the same time period. The Swans' headquarters and training facilities are located at the Sydney Cricket Ground, the club's playing home ground since 1982."
