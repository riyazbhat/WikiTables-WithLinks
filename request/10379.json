  "/wiki/Steel_roller_coaster": "A steel roller coaster is a roller coaster that is defined by having a track made of steel. Steel coasters have earned immense popularity in the past 50 years throughout the world. Incorporating tubular steel track and polyurethane-coated wheels, the steel roller coasters can provide a taller, smoother, and faster ride with more inversions than a traditional wooden roller coaster.\n Arrow Dynamics first introduced the steel roller coaster to feature tubular track to the thrill industry with their creations of the Matterhorn Bobsleds (Disneyland) in 1959 and the Runaway Mine Train (Six Flags Over Texas) in 1966.\n As of 2006, the oldest operating steel roller coaster in North America is Little Dipper at Memphis Kiddie Park in Brooklyn, Ohio and has been operating since April 1952. The oldest operating steel rollercoaster in the world is Monta\u00f1a Suiza at Parque de Atracciones Monte Igueldo (Spain). It has been operating since 1928.",

This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older suspended coaster, which runs under the track, but swings via a pivoting bar attached to the wheel carriage.

  "/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster (also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track, taking tight, flat turns (without banking) at modest speeds, yet producing high lateral G-forces. The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops, the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces. When approaching a turn from a straight section, the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight, and thus plunge off of the device, this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach. Almost all Wild Mice feature \"switchback\" sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections. Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0, but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating). Some riders, usually among taller people, report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns. [citation needed]\n The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself, giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out, thus giving it the name \"wild\". Some may include trick-track \u2014 a \"straight\" piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right.",
  "/wiki/Enclosed_roller_coaster": "An indoor roller coaster or enclosed roller coaster is a roller coaster built inside a structure. The structure may be unrelated to the ride, or it may be intended solely or primarily for the ride. Many indoor coasters are custom made and placed in amusement parks or shopping malls. LaMarcus Adna Thompson, who pioneered the construction of the first simple roller coasters, initially built \"scenic railway\" rides including \"indoor tableaux, panoramas, and biblical scenes illumined by car-tripped switches and flood lamps\". A \"completely enclosed roller coaster\" called the Twister was built as early as 1925. Walt Disney's Space Mountain was one of the first rides considered to be an indoor roller coaster, and was \"the first indoor roller coaster where riders were in total darkness for the length of the ride so they couldn't tell where the drops or turns would occur\".",
  "/wiki/Launched_roller_coaster": "The launched roller coaster is a modern form of roller coaster which has increased in use in the last two decades. In place of a traditional chain lift, the launched coaster initiates a ride with high amounts of acceleration via one or a series of linear induction motors (LIM), linear synchronous motors (LSM), catapults, or other mechanisms employing hydraulic or pneumatic power. This mode of acceleration powers many of the fastest rollercoasters in the world.",

However, there are exceptions, such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City.",
