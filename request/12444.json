Barber (August 2, 1939 \u2013 April 24, 2017) was an American political theorist and author, perhaps best known for his 1995 bestseller, Jihad vs. McWorld, and for 2013's If Mayors Ruled the World as well as the classic of democratic theory, 1984's Strong Democracy (revised in 2004). He became a top-level international consultant on participatory democracy as well as an adviser to Bill Clinton, Howard Dean, and Muammar Gaddafi.",
  "/wiki/Jihad_vs._McWorld": "Jihad vs. McWorld: How Globalism and Tribalism Are Reshaping the World is a 1995 book by American political scientist Benjamin Barber, in which he puts forth a theory that describes the struggle between \"McWorld\" (globalization and the corporate control of the political process) and \"Jihad\" (Arabic term for \"struggle\", here modified to mean tradition and traditional values, in the form of extreme nationalism or religious orthodoxy and theocracy). Benjamin Barber similarly questions the impact of economic globalization as well as its problems for democracy.\n The book was based on a March 1992 article by Barber first published in The Atlantic Monthly. The book employs the basic critique of neoliberalism seen in Barber's earlier, seminal work Strong Democracy. As neoliberal economic theory\u2014not to be confused with social liberalism\u2014is the force behind globalization, this critique is relevant on a much larger scale. Unregulated market forces encounter parochial (which he calls tribal) forces.\n These tribal forces come in many varieties: religious, cultural, ethnic, regional, local, etc. As globalization imposes a culture of its own on a population, the tribal forces feel threatened and react. More than just economic, the crises that arise from these confrontations often take on a sacred quality to the tribal elements; thus Barber's use of the term \"Jihad\" (although in the second edition, he expresses regret at having used that term).[why?]\n Barber's prognosis in Jihad vs McWorld is generally negative\u2014he concludes that neither global corporations nor traditional cultures are supportive of democracy. He further posits that McWorld could ultimately win the \"struggle\".  He also proposes a model for small, local democratic institutions and civic engagement as the hope for an alternative to these two forces.",
