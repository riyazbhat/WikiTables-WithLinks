  "/wiki/Vine_(service)": "Vine (/va\u026an/) was a short-form video hosting service where users shared fifteen-second-long, looping video clips. It was founded in June 2012; American microblogging website Twitter acquired it in October 2012, before its launch on January 24, 2013. Videos were published through Vine's social network, and could be shared on other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The Vine app could be used to browse videos, along with groups of videos by theme, and trending videos. Vine competed with other social-media services such as Instagram and Mobli. By December 2015, Vine had 200 million active users. On October 27, 2016, Twitter announced it would disable uploads, but viewing and download would continue to work. On January 20, 2017, Twitter launched an Internet archive of all Vine videos, allowing people to watch previously uploaded videos. In December 2017, co-founder Dom Hofmann announced that he had begun working on Vine's successor, V2, which he has said is not affiliated with Twitter. However, in May 2018, Hofmann posted on V2's community forums stating that the project was being indefinitely postponed, due in large part to financial and legal hurdles. Since then, Dom has resumed the project after recruiting a team, changing the app's final name to Byte; the app later entered a closed beta, with active community members from a dedicated forum who were accepted via invite. Byte was released for iOS and Android on January 24, 2020.",

It is a brand marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces its history to an online service known as PlayNET, which hosted multi-player games for the Commodore 64.

By 1995, AOL had about 3 million active users. AOL was one of the early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States.
