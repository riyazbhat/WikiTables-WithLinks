  "/wiki/Harry_McShane": "Harry McShane (7 May 1891 \u2013 12 April 1988) was a Scottish socialist, and a close colleague of John Maclean.  \n Born into a Roman Catholic family, he became a Marxist.  Involved in the Clyde Workers Committee and the anti-war movement during the First World War, after the conflict ended he was part of the Tramp Trust Unlimited, formed by Maclean to propagandise and campaign for a minimum wage and a six-hour day, amongst other socialist policies.\n He was a member of the British Socialist Party, like Maclean, but chose to join the Communist Party of Great Britain when it was formed in 1920 rather than follow Maclean into the Scottish Workers Republican Party.  McShane stated of the SRWP, that they \"had some queer people that I didn\u2019t like \u2013 they had never been to John\u2019s economics classes, they knew nothing about socialism or revolutionary work. Even if I had not joined the Communist Party I could never have joined with that crowd\".\n A firm supporter of the Soviet Union, McShane visited Russia in 1932. He was shocked by some of the things he saw there, particularly the working conditions in a coal mine in the Donbas region, which he described as being like something from the previous century. He met a young American journalist who had come to the USSR as a firm supporter, but had become disillusioned, as \"people kept disappearing...and no-one asked any questions\". McShane remembered later that his faith in the Soviet Union remained strong, but he had his first doubts after the trip.\n In the 1930s he became involved with the National Unemployed Workers' Movement and led a number of hunger marches to London. In 1933 McShane lead an NUWM march from Glasgow to Edinburgh which became known as the Scottish Hunger March.  The marchers camped out on the streets of Edinburgh for three days, and McShane chronicled this event in a pamphlet that was published and distributed entitled \"Three Days that Shook Edinburgh\".  In the 1930s, he also fought to ensure that freedom of speech and assembly was allowed on Glasgow Green along with other socialist figures.\n McShane had a number of disagreements with the Communist Party, particularly over the policy document The British Road to Socialism which he regarded as \"reformist\"; ultimately he would leave the Communist Party, but remained a convinced socialist for the remainder of his life.  In 1954 he combined with other socialist figures such as Eric Heffer to create a new organisation, the Federation of Marxist Groups.  In 1958, after reading Marxism and Freedom by Raya Dunayevskaya he embraced Marxist Humanism.  He was also involved in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and was a Scottish correspondent for the Daily Worker.\n While not involved as a full-time organiser, McShane worked as an engineer, and continued to do engineering work until he retired at 69.\n His biography, No Mean Fighter was published in 1978. The book is based on transcriptions of tape recordings made at the suggestion of Paul Foot. Richard Kuper and Pluto Press bought the tape recorder that Joan Smith used to make the recordings. She then worked alongside McShane until together they produced the final draft for publication.\n On 21 December 1984, he was awarded the freedom of the City of Glasgow for his services to the Labour and Trade Union movements.",

  "/wiki/Aitken_Ferguson": "Aitken Ferguson (1891 \u2013 1975) was a Scottish communist activist.\n Born in Glasgow, Ferguson was named after his father.  He worked as a boilermaker, and was active in the Socialist Labour Party.  He was a founder of the Clyde Workers Committee during World War I, and soon after joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and his local Labour Party.  He stood in Glasgow Kelvingrove at the 1923 general election as a communist candidate, with the support of the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers and of the local Labour Party, but not the national body.  Despite this, he performed strongly, coming 1,000 votes behind the successful Conservative Party candidate.\n At the 1924 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election, Ferguson stood again.  The Independent Labour Party opposed his candidacy, initially championing Patrick Dollan as a possible Labour candidate, but Dollan withdrew his name, and on this occasion, Ferguson became the official Labour candidate.  However, Arthur Henderson objected to an advert in Workers Weekly, the CPGB newspaper, asking for donations for Ferguson's campaign, and setting out  radical policies.  Official sponsorship was not withdrawn, but Ferguson received no practical support from the national Labour Party.  He increased his vote total to over 11,000, but again missed out as many Liberal Party supporters voted tactically for the Conservative.\n In 1925, most of the CPGB leadership was arrested, and Ferguson was appointed to an emergency committee, alongside Bob Stewart, George Hardy, Andrew Rothstein, and Emile Burns.  Following this, he addressed the executive of the Comintern in 1926 on the perspectives of the National Minority Movement.  He also polled strongly in Anderston ward, standing for Glasgow City Council in 1927, and stood for the CPGB in Aberdeen North at a 1928 by-election and the 1929 general election.  Although he was well behind the victor on both occasions, his result was considered respectable by the CPGB leadership, as the Aberdeen branch of the party had only ten members.\n Perhaps because of his experiences with the Labour Party, Ferguson was an enthusiastic supporter of the \"New Line\", in which the CPGB distanced itself from Labour; Ferguson only complaining that the line was not being enforced strongly enough.  As a result, he was appointed to the CPGB's central committee in 1929.  He stood in Greenock at the 1931 general election, placing third but not far behind the Labour Party candidate.  In 1932, he was sent to Cumbria to try to strengthen the party there, and he stood for Carlisle City Council.  Following this stint, he was a key figure in the Scottish CPGB for many years, and led calls for Scottish devolution within the party.  He worked with John MacCormick and Roland Muirhead of the Scottish National Party and developed a policy calling for a Scottish Parliament.  This was unpopular within the Scottish party, but Ferguson won the support of the national executive, and it became party policy.",

  "/wiki/Kath_Duncan": "Katharine Sinclair Duncan (n\u00e9e MacColl; 4 July 1888 \u2013 15 August 1954) was a Scottish communist activist.\n Duncan was born in  Tarbert, Argyllshire to Archibald MacColl, a merchant, and Agnes Gibson MacColl (n\u00e9e Stephen).  She became a schoolteacher in Kirkcaldy and joined the National Union of Teachers (NUT).  In 1923, she married a fellow teacher, Alexander \"Sandy\" Duncan, and the couple soon moved to Hackney.  There, they became active in the Hackney Labour Dramatic Group and the Independent Labour Party.  However, their experience of the UK general strike of 1926 led them to instead join the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\n Duncan soon came to prominence in the CPGB, renowned as a powerful speaker.  In 1929, she was elected to the party's central committee, although she stood down the following year, when she moved to Deptford.  There, she focused her time on the National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), organising large demonstrations.  She stood unsuccessfully for Greenwich at the 1931 general election.\n During 1932, local dockers marched in opposition to ships sending arms to Japan, which had just invaded Manchuria.  After one demonstration in Woolwich, both Kath and Sandy spoke; police charged the crowd and Sandy was hospitalised.  A larger protest meeting was held the following day on the Deptford Broadway, with Kath calling for the inspector in charge at the original demonstration to be sacked.  In December, Kath was charged with disturbing the peace over her speeches; she would not accept a condition of being bound over to the keep the peace, so was instead sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison.\n Following Duncan's release, the London County Council removed her from their list of approved teachers, but the NUT organised a petition in her support, and the council reversed their decision.  Duncan, meanwhile, continued frequent public speeches, particularly in support of the NUWM.  In 1934, she stood for election to the London County Council in Deptford, but was not successful.\n Duncan was again arrested in 1935, for speaking outside an unemployment exchange and refusing to move when asked by the police.  The National Council for Civil Liberties supported her in one of their first interventions in a court case; she was found guilty, but the case of Duncan vs Jones became a landmark, establishing that free speech was generally permitted, unless genuinely thought likely to cause a disturbance.\n In the later 1930s, much of Duncan's time was devoted to opposing fascism, and she took part in the Battle of Cable Street.  She was also central to the Aid to Spain movement, and interviewed volunteers for the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War.\n Sandy died during World War II, and Kath increasingly struggled with arthritis.  Although still generally supportive of the CPGB, she began working for the local Labour Party Member of Parliament.  Yet, by the early 1950s, she was too ill to work, and she moved in with her sister in Kirkcaldy, where she died in 1954.\n During the 1930s she lived in Ommaney Road, New Cross London SE14",

Ted became an engineer and joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union.\n Bramley's father was a member of the Social Democratic Federation and the Industrial Workers of the World, and Ted joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1927.  He rapidly rose through the party, joining the Central Committee in 1932 and attending a Comintern meeting in 1933.  He stood in Hammersmith North at the 1931 general election, and again in a 1934 by-election, but did not come close to election.\n Bramley wished to fight in the Spanish Civil War, but the CPGB refused him permission to do so, preferring him to remain in the UK, and appointing him as London District Secretary in 1937. He again hoped to enlist during World War II, but was rejected because he had suffered from tuberculosis.  Instead, he focussed on his party work, leading a movement to occupy London Underground stations during bombing raids.  This work led to his election, in 1946, to the London County Council in Mile End, alongside fellow communist Jack Gaster.\n While a councillor, Bramley led a movement to occupy empty luxury flats, in order to house returning service personnel.  He was charged with conspiracy, and received a suspended sentence.  Facing illness, he resigned as London District Secretary in 1947, but continued to stand in elections, failing to hold his council seat in 1949, then standing unsuccessfully in Stepney at the 1951 general election.\n Around this time, Bramley retired to Herefordshire and entered farming, writing on this topic for the Morning Star.",
