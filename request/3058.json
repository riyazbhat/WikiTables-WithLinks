Ported to PCs running Windows 1.0 in 1987, PageMaker helped to popularize both the Macintosh platform and the Windows environment. A key component that led to PageMaker's success was its native support for Adobe Systems' PostScript page description language. After Adobe purchased the majority of Aldus' assets (including FreeHand, PressWise, PageMaker etc.) in 1994 and subsequently phased out the Aldus name, version 6 was released. The program remained a major force in the high-end DTP market through the early 1990s, but new features were slow in coming. By the mid-1990s, it faced increasing competition from QuarkXPress on the Mac, and to a lesser degree, Ventura on the PC, and by the end of the decade it was no longer a major force. Quark proposed buying the product and cancelling it, but instead, in 1999 Adobe released their Quark Killer, Adobe InDesign.

  "/wiki/Desktop_publishing": "Desktop publishing (DTP) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal (desktop) computer. It was first used almost exclusively for print publications, but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content, from menus to magazines to books, without the expense of commercial printing. Desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution - although a non-WYSIWYG system such as LaTeX could also be used for the creation of highly-structured and technically-demanding documents as well. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than word processing. However, word processing software has evolved to include most, if not all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing. The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays, presentations, infographics, brochures, business cards, promotional items, trade show exhibits, retail package designs and outdoor signs. Although what is classified as DTP software is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP isn't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for electronic media. The job descriptions that include DTP, such as DTP artist, often require skills using software for producing e-books, web content, and web pages, which may involve web design or user interface design for any graphical user interface.",

In the 1980s, he converted his factory to the production of high-end nonstick cookware and in 1984 unveiled Circulon, the first line of hard-anodized, nonstick cookware on the market. When Circulon was introduced, the nonstick system was so unique in extending the durability of nonstick cookware that it was granted a patent. The unique Circulon Hi-Low surface and hard-anodized aluminum substrate made the pans at least three times more abrasion-resistant than any other nonstick cookware on the market. Anolon followed in 1986 as the first hard-anodized nonstick with a smooth cooking surface (and heavier-gauge aluminum than Circulon). Unfortunately, Cheng did not patent the hard-anodized nonstick process, which allowed competitors to develop similar products.
