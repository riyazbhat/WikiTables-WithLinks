With a rich historical and architectural heritage, Beaune is considered the \"Capital of Burgundy wines\".\n It is an ancient and historic town on a plain by the hills of the C\u00f4te d'Or, with features remaining from the pre-Roman and Roman eras, through the medieval and renaissance periods.\n Beaune is a walled city, with about half of the battlements, ramparts, and the moat, having survived in good condition. The central \"old town\" or \"vieille ville\" is extensive. Historically Beaune is intimately connected with the Dukes of Burgundy.\n Landmarks in Beaune include the old market (les Halles), the 15th-century Hospices, the Beffroi (clock tower), and the collegiate church of Notre Dame.

  "/wiki/Monopole_(wine)": "A monopole (French for 'monopoly') is an area controlled by a single winery (wine company) and can be as small as a named vineyard (lieu-dit) or as large as an entire appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC). Frequently this is mentioned on the label as it is rare for only one winery to produce all the wine from an area entitled to a certain name. Each wine is sold by only one company.\n The Napoleonic inheritance laws typically caused vineyards to be so finely divided among inheritors -down to even a single row of vines- that n\u00e9gociants are needed to bottle commercial quantities of a wine. Whether a monopole indicates a wine of unusual quality or not is a matter of debate."
