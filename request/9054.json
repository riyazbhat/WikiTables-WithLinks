  "/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)": "The power forward (PF), also known as the four, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. Power forwards play a role similar to that of center. They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, one of which is rebounding. Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m). Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals. In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 (1.98 m) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 (2.08 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 (1.83 m) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 (1.91 m).",

They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post. \n Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency. In the 1950s and 1960s, George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979\u201380 season, however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished.

They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game. A point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills.
