The film's popularity led to an  NBC television series of the same name. The title character, played by Dan Haggerty, was loosely based on California mountain man James Grizzly Adams (1812-1860). The film and TV series portrayed the fictional Grizzly Adams as a frontier woodsman who fled into the mountains after he was wrongly accused of murder. While struggling to survive, Adams saves an orphaned grizzly bear cub he adopts and names Ben. The bear, while growing to its huge adult size, becomes Adams' closest companion. Consistently kind and gentle, Adams discovers and demonstrates an uncanny ability to gain the trust of most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, and he helps, sometimes rescues, takes in and tames many species. Originally a hunter, with his learned affection for wildlife Adams resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible.",

  "/wiki/Broadcast_syndication": "Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations, without going through a broadcast network.

Shows can be syndicated internationally, although this is less common. The three main types of syndication are first-run syndication, which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication; off-network syndication (colloquially called a rerun), which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or in some cases, first-run syndication; and public broadcasting syndication.",
