At the 1968 World Allround Championships in Helsinki, she won bronze behind Stien Kaiser and Ans Schut, making the podium entirely Dutch. Geijssen then participated in the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, where she became Olympic Champion on the 1,000 m in a new Olympic record time. This made her the first Dutch Olympic Champion in speed skating in Olympic history. The next day, Ans Schut (on the 3,000 m) would become the second, while Kees Verkerk (on the 1,500 m) would become the third Dutch Olympic Champion in speed skating four days after that. Geijssen went on to win Olympic silver on the 1,500 m, just 0.3 seconds behind winner Kaija Mustonen.",

Her time of 4:56.2 (a new Olympic record) was an excellent time those days and she won well ahead of Finnish skater Kaija Mustonen and Dutch compatriot Stien Kaiser, the 3,000 m world record holder at the time.\n In 1969, Schut won silver at the European Allround Championships and bronze at the World Allround Championships. That year, she also skated five world records. The next two years, she fell a few times during international championships (although she did manage to win bronze at the World Allround Championships in 1970). In 1971 she ended her speed skating career, got married, and changed her last name to Boekema-Schut. She has three children.",

  "/wiki/Stien_Baas-Kaiser": "Christina (\"Stien\") Wilhelmina Baas-Kaiser (born 20 May 1938) is a former speed skater from the Netherlands. She was not selected for the 1964 Winter Olympics because of her 'old age' (25 at that time) but later turned out to be the first Dutch female world class speed skater. In both 1965 and 1966, she won bronze at the World Allround Championships. After having become World Allround Champion twice (in 1967 and 1968) \u2013 and also winning her 3rd and 4th Dutch Allround Championships those years \u2013 she participated at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble. Her two bronze medals \u2013 on the 1,500 m, behind Finnish skater Kaija Mustonen and Dutch compatriot Carry Geijssen, and on the 3,000 m behind compatriot Ans Schut and, once more, Kaija Mustonen \u2013 were a bit disappointing. Not she, but Geijssen (who not only won silver on the 1,500 m, but also gold on the 1,000 m) and Schut became the Dutch heroines of those Olympics. Although she was still a formidable competitor in the years that followed, Kaiser was slightly surpassed at major championships by Atje Keulen-Deelstra, who was the same age as Kaiser. In 1972, by then married and 33 years old, Baas-Kaiser was no longer really considered to be a favourite, especially not after her disappointing 11th place at the European Allround Championships.",
