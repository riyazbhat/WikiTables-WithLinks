However, the inlet has interrupted the flow of sand (which normally flows east to west) and consequently there has been major beach erosion on the west side of the inlet including the November 1992 Nor'easter that wiped out much of West Hampton Dunes, New York.

The western terminus is at the Queens\u2013Nassau County line, where the parkway continues westward into New York City as the Grand Central Parkway. The eastern terminus is at New York State Route 347 (NY 347) and NY 454 in Hauppauge. The parkway is designated New York State Route 908G (NY 908G), an unsigned reference route. As its name implies, the parkway services communities along the northern half of the island.\n In western Nassau County the parkway sports six lanes, three eastbound and three westbound, narrowing to four lanes total in central Nassau at the Wantagh Parkway (exit 33) and through its twelve miles (19 km) or so in western Suffolk County, where it ends.  It was constructed in stages throughout the 1930s and again post-World War II in the late 1940s/early 1950s until it reached its current terminus in Hauppauge in 1965.  The Northern State Parkway is an eastern extension of the Grand Central Parkway.  It was part of master planner Robert Moses' extensive road-building campaign and was built as a sister road to the Southern State Parkway.  In recent years its design has quickly become dated due to an increase in commuter traffic using the roadway, and numerous improvements have been made (including the widening from four to six lanes in Central Nassau west to the Nassau-Queens line where it becomes the Grand Central) or are still on paper.",

The CDP is a proximate representation of the East Patchogue hamlet used for statistical purposes of the Census Bureau.\n Patchogue has historically been a major shopping and commerce hub of Suffolk County. \"Patchogue\" in the narrow sense is an incorporated village with narrow limits, only about a mile and a half wide.  East Patchogue includes the eastern portion of Patchogue in the wider sense, as well as the area east of that but still west of the incorporated village of Bellport.  This double meaning of \"East Patchogue\" is reflected in the naming of New York State Route 27A: It is called \"East Main Street\" in the western portion of East Patchogue, and \"Montauk Highway\" (as it typically is outside of villages) in the eastern portion.  The Patchogue side of East Patchogue is in the Patchogue-Medford School District; the Bellport side is in the South Country Central School District, and its high-school students attend Bellport High School.  Some maps even refer to southwestern East Patchogue as West Bellport.  The northern part of East Patchogue, which until the 1980s was less developed, has sometimes been referred to as South Medford.\n The area around County Road 80 in the western portion of East Patchogue was once commonly regarded as the hamlet of Hagerman.   In New York, a hamlet has no official boundaries or government and refers only to a named, settled area. With suburban growth, Hagerman is no longer distinct from its surroundings, and the name has fallen into disuse, especially since the removal of the Hagerman station on the Long Island Railroad. There still exists the Hagerman Fire District.\n Prior to its closure, the East Patchogue post office was located at 1415 Montauk Highway.",

Within Queens, the road is now known as Merrick Boulevard, and for its entire run in Nassau County, the road is Merrick Road, with the Montauk Highway designation picking up in Amityville. The designations assigned to the road have also changed over time: Montauk Highway was the original route of NY 27 until most of it was superseded in purpose by Sunrise Highway, and for a brief time all of Montauk Highway west of Southampton was signed as NY 27A.
