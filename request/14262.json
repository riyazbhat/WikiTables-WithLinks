  "/wiki/The_Lone_Ranger": "The Lone Ranger is an American western drama television series that aired on the ABC Television network from 1949 to 1957, with Clayton Moore in the starring role. Jay Silverheels, a member of the Mohawk Aboriginal people in Canada, played The Lone Ranger's Indian companion Tonto.\n John Hart replaced Moore in the title role from 1952 to 1954 owing to a contract dispute. Fred Foy, who had been both narrator and announcer of the radio series from 1948 until its ending, was the announcer. Gerald Mohr was originally employed as the narrator for the television series, but story narration was dropped after 16 episodes. The Lone Ranger was the highest-rated television program on ABC in the early 1950s and its first true \"hit\". The series finished #7 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1950\u20131951 season, #18 for 1951\u20131952 and #29 for 1952\u20131953.",
  "/wiki/Tonto": "Tonto is a fictional character; he is the Native American (either Comanche or Potawatomi) companion of the Lone Ranger, a popular American Western character created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker. Tonto has appeared in radio and television series and other presentations of the characters' adventures righting wrongs in 19th century western United States.\n In Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, \"tonto\" translates as \"a dumb person\", \"moron\", or \"fool\". In the Italian version the original name is retained, but in the Spanish dubbed version, the character is called \"Toro\" (Spanish for \"bull\") or \"Ponto\". Show creator Trendle grew up in  Michigan, and knew members of the local Potawatomi tribe, who told him it meant \"wild one\" in their language. When he created the Lone Ranger, he gave the moniker to the Ranger's sidekick, apparently unaware of the name's negative connotations.   \n Tonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show, which originated on the Detroit, Michigan, radio station WXYZ. Though he became well known as the Lone Ranger's friend, Tonto was originally created just so the Lone Ranger would have someone with whom to talk. Throughout the radio run (which spanned 21 years), with only a few exceptions, Tonto was played by American actor John Todd.\nChief Thundercloud played the character in the Republic movie serials The Lone Ranger and The Lone Ranger Rides Again.  To this point, Tonto had been depicted, on the radio series, as a somewhat elderly sidekick.  This serial established the better-remembered image of Tonto as a handsome young tribal warrior in buckskins.  The only diversion from this image since then has been in the generally disliked 2013 film, The Lone Ranger.\n Jay Silverheels portrayed the arguably best-remembered version in The Lone Ranger television series. This was the highest-rated television program on the ABC network in the early 1950s and its first true \"hit\".\n Ivan Naranjo, a Blackfoot/Southern Ute actor from Colorado, voiced the character in The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour.\n Michael Horse portrayed Tonto in the film The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1981). \n Johnny Depp's depiction was the most recent portrayal in Disney's 2013 film The Lone Ranger.",
  "/wiki/Comic_book_series": "A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan, comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, Famous Funnies, was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\n The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at \u00a5586.4 billion ($6\u20137 billion), with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books/magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues per person). The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at $1.09 billion in 2016. As of 2017[update], the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.",
  "/wiki/Trade_paperback_(comics)": "In comics, a trade paperback (often shortened to trade) is a collection of stories originally published in comic books, reprinted in book format, usually presenting either a complete miniseries, a story arc from a single title, or a series of stories with an arc or common theme.\n A trade paperback may reproduce the stories either at the same size in which they were originally presented (in comic book format), in a smaller \"digest-sized\" format, or a larger-than-original hardcover.  This article applies to both paperback and hardcover collections. In the comics industry, the term \"trade paperback market\" may refer to the market for any collection, regardless of its actual cover.\n A trade paperback differs from a graphic novel in that a graphic novel is usually original material. It is also different from the publishing term trade paperback, which is a book with a flexible cardstock cover that is larger than the standard mass market paperback format.\n Trade paperbacks account for a minority of the American comic book industry, which is dominated by sales of staple-bound periodicals.",

The company has published non-DC Universe-related material, including Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Fables and many titles under their alternative imprint Vertigo.\n The initials \"DC\" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics, which featured Batman's debut and subsequently became part of the company's name.

  "/wiki/Vertigo_Comics": "Vertigo (also known as Vertigo Comics or DC Vertigo) is a discontinued imprint of the American comic book publisher DC Comics. It was created in 1993 to publish stories with more graphic or adult content, which did not fit within the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority or DC's primary superhero brand, thus allowing more creative freedom. These comics were free to contain explicit violence, substance abuse, sexuality, nudity, profanity, and other controversial subjects, similar to films and TV shows intended for adult audiences. Following a series of editorial restructurings in the 2010s, DC discontinued it in January 2020, instead publishing later \"mature readers\" work under the \"DC\" label.\n Although its initial publications were primarily in the horror and fantasy genres, over time it also published works dealing with crime, social commentary, speculative fiction, biography, and other genres. Originally publishing a mix of company-owned work based on DC's existing characters, and creator-owned work, its focus shifted to the latter. It pioneered in North America the publishing model in which monthly series sold through comic book shops are periodically collected into editions which are kept in print for bookstore sale.\n Several Vertigo series won the comics industry's Eisner Award, including the \"best continuing series\" of various years (The Sandman, Preacher, 100 Bullets, Y: The Last Man, and Fables). Several of its publications were adapted to film (such as Constantine, A History of Violence, Stardust, and V for Vendetta) and episodic television (such as Constantine, iZombie, Lucifer, and Preacher).",

It generally included two other four-page strips (initially Mr. Mystic and Lady Luck), plus filler material. Eisner, the overall editor, wrote and drew most Spirit entries, with the uncredited assistance of his studio of assistants and collaborators, though with Eisner's singular vision a unifying factor.\nThe Spirit chronicles the adventures of a masked vigilante who fights crime with the blessing of the city's police commissioner Dolan, an old friend. Despite the Spirit's origin as detective/criminoligist Denny Colt, his real identity was rarely referred to after his first appearance, and for all intents and purposes he was simply \"The Spirit\". The stories are presented in a wide variety of styles, from straightforward crime drama and noir to lighthearted adventure, from mystery and horror to comedy and love stories, often with hybrid elements that twisted genre and reader expectations.\n From the 1960s to 1980s, a handful of new Eisner Spirit stories appeared in Harvey Comics and elsewhere, and Warren Publishing and Kitchen Sink Press variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and in color comic books.

The main outlet for his stories was Weird Tales, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly-read author, with his best works still reprinted.\n Howard's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health.

  "/wiki/Jack_The_Ripper": "Jack the Ripper was an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts, the killer was called the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron.\n Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer. The name \"Jack the Ripper\" originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The \"From Hell\" letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee came with half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as \"Jack the Ripper\", mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events.\n Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper, and the legend solidified. A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims\u2014Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly\u2014are known as the \"canonical five\" and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked.

He was born into affluence, which ended with the death of his grandfather. In 1913, he wrote a critical letter to a pulp magazine that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. During the interwar period, he wrote and published stories that focused on his interpretation of humanity's place in the universe. In his view, humanity was an unimportant part of an uncaring cosmos that could be swept away at any moment. These stories also included fantastic elements that represented the perceived fragility of anthropocentrism.\n Lovecraft was at the center of a wider body of authors known as \"The Lovecraft Circle.\" This group wrote stories that frequently shared details between them. He was also a prolific writer of letters. He maintained a correspondence with several different authors and literary proteges. According to some estimates, he wrote approximately 100,000 letters over the course of his lifetime.[n 2] In these letters, he discussed his worldview, his daily life and tutored younger authors, such as August Derleth, Donald Wandrei, and Robert Bloch.\n Throughout his adult life, Lovecraft was never able to support himself from earnings as an author and editor. He was virtually unknown during his lifetime and was almost exclusively published in pulp magazines before he died in poverty at the age of 46, but is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors of supernatural horror fiction.

  "/wiki/DC_Comics/Vertigo": "Vertigo (also known as Vertigo Comics or DC Vertigo) is a discontinued imprint of the American comic book publisher DC Comics. It was created in 1993 to publish stories with more graphic or adult content, which did not fit within the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority or DC's primary superhero brand, thus allowing more creative freedom. These comics were free to contain explicit violence, substance abuse, sexuality, nudity, profanity, and other controversial subjects, similar to films and TV shows intended for adult audiences. Following a series of editorial restructurings in the 2010s, DC discontinued it in January 2020, instead publishing later \"mature readers\" work under the \"DC\" label.\n Although its initial publications were primarily in the horror and fantasy genres, over time it also published works dealing with crime, social commentary, speculative fiction, biography, and other genres. Originally publishing a mix of company-owned work based on DC's existing characters, and creator-owned work, its focus shifted to the latter. It pioneered in North America the publishing model in which monthly series sold through comic book shops are periodically collected into editions which are kept in print for bookstore sale.\n Several Vertigo series won the comics industry's Eisner Award, including the \"best continuing series\" of various years (The Sandman, Preacher, 100 Bullets, Y: The Last Man, and Fables). Several of its publications were adapted to film (such as Constantine, A History of Violence, Stardust, and V for Vendetta) and episodic television (such as Constantine, iZombie, Lucifer, and Preacher).",
