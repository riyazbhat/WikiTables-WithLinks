  "/wiki/Archie_D'Arcy": "Archibald \"Archie\" D'Arcy (18 September 1870 \u2013 22 June 1919) was a New Zealand rugby union player. D'Arcy was born and raised in Masterton, New Zealand, and first played rugby for the Red Star club before later playing with Masterton.

Despite being selected as a fullback, D'Arcy played two matches on the tour in the forwards.\n He was again selected for New Zealand in 1894, this time to play the touring New South Wales side.

  "/wiki/Rugby_union_positions": "In the game of rugby union, there are 15 players on each team, comprising eight forwards (wearing jerseys numbered 1\u20138) and seven backs (numbered 9\u201315). In addition, there may be up to eight replacement players \"on the bench\", numbered 16\u201323. Players are not restricted to a single position, although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types. Players that play multiple positions are called \"utility players\".\n Forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line-outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs. Props push in the scrums, while the hooker tries to secure the ball for their team by \"hooking\" it back with their heel. The hooker is also the one who is responsible for throwing the ball in at line-outs, where it is mostly competed for by the locks, who are generally the tallest players on the team. The flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team.\n The backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster. Successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking. Full-backs need to be good defenders and kickers, and have the ability to catch a kicked ball. The wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team and score many of the tries. The centres' key attacking roles are to break through the defensive line and link successfully with wingers. The fly-half can be a good kicker and generally directs the back line. The scrum-half retrieves the ball from the forwards and needs a quick and accurate pass to get the ball to the backs (often firstly to the fly-half).\n Early names, such as \"three-quarters\" (for the wings and centres) and \"outside-half\" (for fly-half) are sometimes used in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere the fly-half and inside centre are colloquially called \"first five-eighth\" and \"second five-eighth\" respectively, while the scrum-half is known as the \"half-back\".\n The scrum (a contest used to restart play) must consist of eight players from each team: the \"front row\" (two props, a loosehead and tighthead, and a hooker), the \"second row\" (two locks), and a \"back row\" (two flankers, and a number 8). The players outside the scrum are called \"the backs\": scrum-half, fly-half, inside centre, outside centre, two wings, and a fullback.",

  "/wiki/David_Gage": "David Richmond \"Davy\" Gage (11 January 1868 \u2013 12 October 1916) was a New Zealand rugby union footballer. He played with the 1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team, and represented New Zealand in 1893, and once in 1896 when he captained the side.\n Gage was born in Kihikihi to Annie (daughter of Joseph Jenner Merrett and Rangitetaea Koa) and John Gage (son of George Gage and Waana Pororua). After an early education in Auckland, he was awarded a scholarship to attend Te Aute College in the Hawke's Bay. After joining the Poneke Football Club of fellow Te Aute old-boy Thomas Ellison in 1887, he made his provincial debut for Wellington in that same year. It was probably at Ellison's suggestion that he was selected for Joe Warbrick's Native Football team that toured New Zealand, Australia, and Britain in 1888 and 1889.\n Gage played in 68 of the Natives side's 74 matches when in Britain, and appeared in their fixtures against Ireland, Wales, and England. The 74 British Isles matches were played over a period of six months, averaging a match every 2.3 days, and the Natives' team often struggled to field a fit side. He could play anywhere in the backs, and ended up appearing in every back-line position despite originally being selected as a fullback. When the Natives toured Australia after the British Isles leg of their tour, Gage returned to New Zealand due to an ill relative. He did turn out for the team once they returned to New Zealand however, when he played a further five matches.\n After returning to Wellington, Gage continued playing for Poneke, and represented Wellington in 1889. The following season, the Wellington Rugby Union (WRU)\u2014which administered the sport in the city\u2014decided that Gage was ineligible for selection in the provincial team. Poneke responded by withdrawing from the club competition, and the exclusion of any Poneke players weakened the Wellington side considerably. Hawke's Bay hosted Wellington that season, and Gage was eligible for the Bay side after playing several club games in the region; despite the opportunity to \"get even\" with the Wellington authorities, he declined to play for Hawke's Bay.[a] 1891 and 1892 saw Gage return to the Wellington side, and he was then selected for the first representative New Zealand side organised under the authority of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union. The New Zealand team toured Australia in 1893, and was captained by Gage's Poneke and Wellington teammate Ellison. He was again selected for New Zealand in 1896, this time captaining the team against Queensland in Wellington. During his rugby career, which ended in 1901, Gage amassed 131 first-class appearances, an enormous number for the time.\n \nGage worked as both a M\u0101ori interpreter, and later for the Wellington City Council. Following Gage's death from tuberculosis at age 48, the Poneke Club raised money to pay for his headstone in Karori Cemetery, and support his widow and six children.
