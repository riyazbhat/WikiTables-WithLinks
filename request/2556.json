He played six seasons in Major League Baseball with the Milwaukee Brewers (1884), Detroit Wolverines (1885\u20131888), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1890), and Buffalo Bisons (1890).\n Baldwin had his best season in 1886 when he compiled a 42\u201313 record and a 2.24 earned run average (ERA), threw 55 complete games, and led the National League with 323 strikeouts.  Baldwin's 42 wins in 1886 set the major league record for a left-handed pitcher and remains the second highest single season total by a southpaw. Baldwin also pitched five complete games for a 4\u20131 record and a 1.50 ERA in the 1887 World Series. Arm troubles cut short Baldwin's major league career at age 31.",
  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer.\n Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position.",

  "/wiki/Outfielder": "An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball or softball, farthest from the batter. These defenders are the left fielder, the center fielder, and the right fielder. As an outfielder, their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances, if there is any runners on the bases. As an outfielder, they normally play behind the six players located in the field.\nBy convention, each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered. The outfield positions are 7 (left field), 8 (center field) and 9 (right field). These numbers are shorthand designations useful in baseball scorekeeping and are not necessarily the same as the squad numbers worn on player uniforms.\n Outfielders named to the MLB All-Century Team are Hank Aaron, Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Pete Rose, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Ken Griffey Jr.",

For example, if the batter bats a base hit, then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run, and the batter gets credited with batting in that run.\n Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI statistic was tabulated\u2014unofficially\u2014from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research.\n Common nicknames for an RBI include \"ribby\" (or \"ribbie\"), \"rib\", and \"ribeye\". The plural of RBI is generally \"RBIs\", although some commentators use \"RBI\" as both singular and plural, as it can also stand for \"runs batted in\".",

  "/wiki/First_base": "First base, or 1B, is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player's team. A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\n Also called first sacker or cornerman, the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes. Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders, the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls. In order for the runner to be called out, the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base. First base is often referred to as \"the other hot corner\"\u2014the \"hot corner\" being third base\u2014and therefore, like the third baseman, he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line, mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field.

  "/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1890\u201391)": "The Philadelphia Athletics were a short-lived Major League Baseball franchise that existed for two seasons from 1890 to 1891.  Known alternatively as the Philadelphia Quakers, and sometimes informally as \"Buffinton's Beauties\", they played their first season in the newly created Players' League (PL) of 1890, and were managed by Jim Fogarty and Charlie Buffinton.  After the demise of the PL following the 1890 season, the team switched to the American Association (AA) for the 1891 season, and were managed by Bill Sharsig and George Wood.  For each season, the franchise used Forepaugh Park as their home field.\n Before the 1890 season, the PL was founded by the first organized professional sports union, the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players, in an attempt to compete with the existing major leagues, the National League (NL) and the AA.  Their intent was to break free from the standard business practices of the two leagues that they claimed stifled players' salaries; such as the reserve clause, and the Brush Classification System, as well as their ability to sell players to another team without the consent of the player.  The Quakers were controlled by a group of investors, which included brothers G. W. and J. Earl Wagner.\n Under the pressure of PL investors, who were seeking recoupment of massive financial losses following the 1890 season, pressured the Brotherhood to compromise with the NL and AA.  The deal called for the dissolution of the league, while allowing the players to return to their old teams without penalty, with the reserve clause and the selling of players, without their consent, outlawed.  The Quakers were allowed entrance into the AA for 1891 season and claimed the nickname of the team they were replacing, the Philadelphia Athletics, who had been expelled for violating the league constitution.\n Although many players departed for new teams for the 1891 season, including Buffinton, Shindle, and Mike Griffin, they were able to sign suitable replacements, such as Gus Weyhing, Elton Chamberlain, and Pop Corkhill.  The team completed the season with a 73\u201366 win-loss record, with four ties, placing them fifth among nine teams.  Following the 1891 season, the AA could no longer operate due to great financial losses, and were forced to fold, with four teams being consolidated with the NL, and the others accepting buyouts.  The Athletics fell into the latter group, and ceased operations.  Pitcher Bert Cunningham set a dubious record when he threw five wild pitches in one inning on Sept. 15, 1890, a record that would go unmatched for 110 years until Rick Ankiel tied it in a playoff game.",

  "/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball": "In Major League Baseball, a shutout (denoted statistically as ShO or SHO) refers to the act by which a single pitcher pitches a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a run. If two or more pitchers combine to complete this act, no pitcher is awarded a shutout, although the team itself can be said to have \"shut out\"  the opposing team.\n The ultimate single achievement among pitchers is a perfect game, which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years, most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2012. By definition, a perfect game is counted as a shutout. A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score through a series of errors, base on balls, catcher's interferences, dropped third strikes, or hit batsmen. The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson, who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907\u20131927. He accumulated 110 shutouts, which is 20 more than the second place leader, Pete Alexander. The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball, because pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching. Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers.\n The current leader among active players for career shutouts is Clayton Kershaw, who has thrown 15.",

  "/wiki/Pittsburgh_Burghers": "The Pittsburgh Burghers were a baseball team in the Players' League, a short-lived Major League that existed only for the 1890 season.  The team included a number of players who had jumped from the National League's Pittsburgh Alleghenys (now the Pittsburgh Pirates), including Hall of Famers Pud Galvin, Ned Hanlon, and Jake Beckley. Hanlon served as the team's manager. Meanwhile, John Tener, who would go on to represent Pittsburgh in the United States Congress and be elected the 25th Governor of Pennsylvania, finished his pitching career with the Burghers in 1890. Later Tener would become the president of the National League, and a director of the Philadelphia Phillies.\n In its only season, the Burghers finished in 6th place with a 60-68 record. Hall Of Fame first baseman Jake Beckley was a powerhouse slugger for the Burghers. He hit .324 with 10 home runs and 120 RBIs. In addition, he led the PL by hitting 22 triples. But even Beckley's fine work could not overcome the weak hitting of the Pittsburgh team in general. The Burghers finished tied for the worst batting average in the loop with a .260 mark. The team played at the Alleghenies' former home, Exposition Park. The stadium and the team was located in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, which was not incorporated into the city of Pittsburgh until 1907. The area is currently known today as the North Side of Pittsburgh, and the site of Exposition Park was later used for Three Rivers Stadium.\n In an indirect way, it can be argued that the Burghers, alone among the old Players' League franchises, still exist today.  Nearly all of the Alleghenys' stars had jumped to the upstart league.  The remains of the Alleghenys made a wretched showing, finishing with what is still the worst record in franchise history (and the second-worst in National League history).  The resulting drain on attendance led Alleghenys owner Dennis McKnight to return his franchise to the National League.  He then joined the Burghers' ownership group as a minority owner.  This group repurchased the Pittsburgh National League franchise under a different corporate name, thus allowing them to legally regain title to most of the players who had bolted to the Players' League a year earlier.  It is this franchise that forms the current ownership lineage of today's Pirates.  In fact, the Pirates nickname can also be traced back to this Burgher episode.  On reacquiring the National League franchise, the new owners scooped up Lou Bierbauer, a second baseman from the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders of the defunct Players' League, inadvertently left off the roster of the American Association's Philadelphia Athletics, who as his prior team claimed his rights.  This led an AA official to denounce the Alleghenys' actions as \"piratical\"\u2014an accusation that led the Alleghenys to rename themselves the Pirates for the next season.",

  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball  (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy.\n A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three, four, or five days after pitching a game before pitching another. Therefore, most professional baseball teams have four, five or six starting pitchers on their rosters. These pitchers, and the sequence in which they pitch, is known as the rotation. In modern baseball, a five-man rotation is most common.\n In contrast, a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Occasionally, an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings, and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher.",

It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched. Alternatively, it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs.

For example, a 20\u201310 win\u2013loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses.\n In each game, one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the \"winning pitcher\") and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the \"losing pitcher\") in their respective statistics. These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record. The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision, and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision. A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have no decision. In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win.\n The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league's rules. The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited, such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture. If the game is tied (a rare event), no pitcher is awarded any decision.

  "/wiki/Dummy_Hoy": "William Ellsworth \"Dummy\" Hoy (May 23, 1862 \u2013 December 15, 1961) was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for several teams from 1888 to 1902, most notably the Cincinnati Reds and two Washington, D.C., franchises.\n Hoy is the most accomplished deaf player in MLB history, and is credited by some sources with causing the establishment of signals for safe and out calls. He held the MLB record for games in center field (1,726) from 1889 to 1902, set records for career putouts (3,958) and total chances (4,625) as an outfielder, and retired among the leaders in outfield games (2nd; 1,795), assists (7th; 273), and double plays (3rd; 72).  He was also an excellent baserunner, scoring over 100 runs nine times, and often finishing among the top base stealers.  He is one of only 29 players to have played in four different Major Leagues.  His 1,006 career walks put him second in MLB history behind Billy Hamilton when he retired, and he also ended his career ranking eighth in career games played (1,796).",
  "/wiki/Center_fielder": "A center fielder, abbreviated CF, is the outfielder in baseball who plays defense in center field \u2013 the baseball and softball fielding position between left field and right field. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.",
  "/wiki/Games_pitched": "In baseball statistics, games pitched (denoted by Games G in tables of only pitching statistics) is the number of games in which a player appears as a pitcher; a player who is announced as the pitcher must face at least one batter, although exceptions are made if the pitcher announced in the starting lineup is injured before facing a batter, perhaps while batting or running the bases in the top of the first inning, before the opposing team comes to bat. The statistic is also referred to as appearances, usually to refer to the number of games a relief pitcher has pitched in.",
  "/wiki/Runs_scored": "In baseball, a run is scored when a player advances around first, second and third base and returns safely to home plate, touching the bases in that order, before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured. A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely \"on base\" (that is, on first, second, or third) as a runner and subsequently brings him home. The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent.\n The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then, even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made, his run does not count. However, if the third out is not a force out, but a tag out, then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made, his run will count. In baseball statistics, a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run (R), sometimes referred to as a \"run scored\". While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic, it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in (RBIs). Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent; however, the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player's contribution toward producing runs for his team.\n A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics, which differentiate between standard earned runs (for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors, which do not count in his personal statistics. Specifically, if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning, the Official Scorer \u2013 the official in-game statistician \u2013 in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned, will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred. For example, with two outs, suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error, and then the next batter hits a two-run home run, and then the following batter then makes the third out, ending the inning. If the inning is reconstructed without the error, and if that third batter, instead of reaching on an error, registered an out, the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring. Thus, the two runs that did score will be classified as unearned, and will not count in the pitcher's personal statistics.\n If a pitching substitution occurs while a runner is on base, and that runner eventually scores a run, the pitcher who allowed the player to get on base is charged with the run even though he was no longer pitching when the run scored.",
  "/wiki/Stolen_bases": "In baseball, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner. The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10.\n A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate.\n Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing.",
  "/wiki/John_Irwin_(baseball)": "John Irwin (July 21, 1861 \u2013 February 28, 1934) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball in the 19th century.",
  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base \u2014  the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number '5'.\n The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, as he is often the closest infielder (roughly 90\u2013120 feet) to the batter. The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base. The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play. The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory.\n Third base is known as the \"hot corner\", because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction. A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour (201 km/h). Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected, creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply. As with middle infielders, right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base. Mike Squires, who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983, is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty. Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast.\n Expectations of how well a third baseman should be able to hit have varied a great deal over time; in the early years of the sport, these expectations were similar to those for shortstops, the third baseman being merely the less skilled defensive player. Players who could hit with more ability often were not suited for third base, either because they were left-handed or because they were not mobile enough for the position. However, the beginning of the live-ball era in the 1920s created a greater demand for more offense, and third basemen have since been expected to hit either for a high average (.290 or better) or with moderate to substantial power.  Since the 1950s the position has become more of a power position with sluggers such as Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Ron Santo becoming stars.\n There are fewer third basemen in the Baseball Hall of Fame than there are Hall of Famers of any other position. Furthermore, with the notable exception of John McGraw and Bobby Cox, few third basemen have gone on to have successful managing careers, with Jimmy Dykes and Negro Leaguer Dave Malarcher being perhaps the next most prominent managers who began their careers at third base.",
  "/wiki/George_Keefe": "George Washington Keefe (January 7, 1867 in Washington, D.C. \u2013 August 24, 1935 in Washington, D.C.) was a left-handed professional baseball starting pitcher who played for the Washington Nationals, Buffalo Bisons and Washington Statesmen from 1886 to 1891.\n Keefe made his major league debut on July 30, 1886 at the age of 19. The sixth youngest player in the league, he went 0-3 with a 5.17 ERA in four games in his first big league season.\n In 1887, Keefe appeared in only one game. Despite allowing 16 hits, four walks and 20 runs (only eight of which were earned), Keefe managed to complete (and lose) his only game of the season. He was also the sixth youngest player in 1887.\n Keefe went 6-7 with a 2.84 ERA in 13 starts in 1888. In 1889, he went 8-18 with a 5.13 ERA, finishing fifth in the league in walks allowed (143) and seventh in losses. On May 1, 1889, Keefe set the National League record for most walks in an inning, when he walked seven batters in the fifth inning. The record was subsequently tied by Bob Ewing and Tony Mullane, and Dolly Gray walked eight batters in an inning in 1909. Gray was an American League pitcher, however.\n Following the 1889 season, Keefe went to play for the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League. He went 6-16 that year, posting a 6.52 ERA. He was ninth in the league in home runs allowed (11), 10th in the league in losses and 10th in the league in earned runs allowed (142). In 196 innings, he walked 138 batters and struck out only 55.\n Keefe played his final season in 1891 for the Washington Statesmen of the American Association. With them, he went 0-3 with a 2.68 ERA in five games (four starts). His one save was third in the league. He played his final big league game on April 28.\n Overall, Keefe went 20-48 in 78 games, 71 of which he started. He completed 68 games, shutting out one of them. In 616\u200b1\u20443 innings, Keefe posted a 5.05 ERA, 360 walks and 213 strikeouts. In 250 career at-bats, Keefe hit .172.\n According to the Similarity Scores at Baseball-Reference.com, Keefe is most statistically similar to Mike Morrison.\n Following his death, Keefe was buried in Cedar Hills Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland.",

  "/wiki/Lewis_(baseball)": "Lewis (First name unknown) was a Major League Baseball player who played one game in 1890 with the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League.\n Lewis made his major league debut, and sole appearance, on July 12, 1890 as the starting pitcher for the Bisons in a game against the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders.  Lewis gave up six runs in the first inning, six in the second, and eight in the third.  After three innings, with Brooklyn leading, 20-4, Buffalo's manager Jack Rowe  moved Lewis to left field, and called on left fielder Ed Beecher to pitch the final six innings.  In Lewis's three innings as a pitcher, he gave up 20 earned runs, 13 hits, and seven bases on balls. He also collected one hit in five at bats.  Brooklyn won the game by a score of 28-16.\n According to author Norman L. Macht, the Bisons had been having problems with various pitchers and arrived in Brooklyn on the 12th, \"when a local boy, whose last name was Lewis but whose first name remains mercifully unknown\" told manager Jack Rowe that he was a pitcher and asked for a tryout.  Rowe started Lewis and kept him in the game for three innings, before pulling him in favor of Beecher, who gave up eight more runs.  Neither Lewis nor Beecher pitched in another major league game.\n One newspaper account described Lewis's try-out as a \"disastrous experiment\" and called the game \"one of the greatest slugging matches ever seen since curve pitching came into vogue.\" Sporting Life reported: \"The Buffalos tried a new pitcher named Lewis in the box, but after three innings he retired to left field, a much disgusted ball tosser.  Beecher took his place and fared but little better.\"",
  "/wiki/Connie_Mack": "Cornelius McGillicuddy (December 22, 1862 \u2013 February 8, 1956), better known as Connie Mack, was an American professional baseball catcher, manager, and team owner. The longest-serving manager in Major League Baseball history, he holds records for wins (3,731), losses (3,948), and games managed (7,755), with his victory total being almost 1,000 more than any other manager.\n Mack managed the Philadelphia Athletics for the club's first 50 seasons of play, starting in 1901, before retiring at age 87 following the 1950 season, and was at least part-owner from 1901 to 1954. He was the first manager to win the World Series three times, and is the only manager to win consecutive Series on separate occasions (1910\u201311, 1929\u201330); his five Series titles remain the third most by any manager, and his nine American League pennants rank second in league history. However, constant financial struggles forced repeated rebuilding of the roster, and Mack's teams also finished in last place 17 times. Mack was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New York in 1937.",
  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket, but in cricket, wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities.\n Positioned behind home plate, the catcher can see the whole field, and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.\n Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game's strategies, the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, including such prominent examples as Connie Mack, Steve O'Neill, Al L\u00f3pez, Mike Scioscia, and Joe Torre. The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season, and can have a negative effect on their offensive output.\n Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching, if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills, teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses. A knowledgeable catcher's ability to work with the pitcher, via pitch selection and location, can diminish the effectiveness of the opposing team's offense. Many great defensive catchers toiled in relative anonymity, because they did not produce large offensive numbers. Notable examples of light-hitting, defensive specialists were Ray Schalk, Jim Hegan, Jim Sundberg and Brad Ausmus. Schalk's career batting average of .253 is the lowest of any position player in the Baseball Hall of Fame. That he was selected for enshrinement in 1955 was largely a tribute to his outstanding defensive skills.\n In the numbering system used to record baseball plays, the catcher is assigned the number '2'.

The team existed for one season, 1890, and played in the Players' League. The Bisons played their home games at Olympic Park. Hall of Famer Connie Mack was part owner and catcher for the Bisons.\n In their only year as a major league franchise, the Bisons finished the 1890 season with a 36-96 record, last place in the PL. Jack Rowe managed the majority of the teams games, with 99 games, and Jay Faatz managed 33 games.
