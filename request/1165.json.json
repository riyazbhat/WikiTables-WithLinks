  "/wiki/Duke_of_Perth": "Earl of Perth is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1605 for James Drummond, 4th Lord Drummond. The Drummond family claim descent from Maurice, son of George, a younger son of King Andrew I of Hungary. Maurice arrived in Scotland on the ship which brought Edgar \u00c6theling, the Saxon claimant to the crown of England after the Norman Conquest, and his sister Margaret to Scotland in 1068. Maurice was given lands in Lennox (Dunbartonshire), together with the hereditary stewardship of the county. The Hungarian Prince theory has been discounted as no evidence of any relationships exists in written records.  \"The Red Book of the Menteiths\" clearly discounts the Hungarian Prince as a myth likely formed to give status to the Drummond origins. The Drummonds in the 12th Century were allied to the Menteiths their early fortunes became through the relationship.  Indeed, one \"Johannes De Drumon\", said to have died in 1301, was buried in Inchmahome Priory which was founded by the Menteiths.   His successor John Drummond, the 7th Steward, was deprived of the lands and retired into Perthshire.",
