  "/wiki/John_W._Davis": "John William Davis (April 13, 1873 \u2013 March 24, 1955) was an American politician, diplomat and lawyer. He served under President Woodrow Wilson as the Solicitor General of the United States and the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He was the Democratic nominee for president in 1924 and lost to Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge.\n Born and raised in West Virginia, Davis briefly worked as a teacher before beginning his long legal career. Davis's father, John J. Davis, had been a delegate to the Wheeling Convention and served in the United States House of Representatives in the 1870s. Davis joined his father's legal practice and adopted many of his father's political views, including opposition to anti-lynching legislation and support for states' rights. Davis served in the United States House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913, helping to write the Clayton Antitrust Act. He held the position of solicitor general from 1913 to 1918, during which time he successfully argued for the illegality of Oklahoma's \"grandfather law\" in Guinn v. United States.\n While serving as the ambassador to Britain from 1918 to 1921, Davis was a dark horse candidate for the 1920 Democratic presidential nomination. After he left office, Davis helped establish the Council on Foreign Relations and advocated for the repeal of Prohibition. The 1924 Democratic National Convention nominated Davis for president after 103 ballots. His nomination made him the second nominee (With Wilson having been nominated in 1912) from a former slave state, Virginia since the Civil War, and Davis remains the only major party presidential candidate from West Virginia. Running on a ticket with Charles W. Bryan, Davis lost in a landslide to Coolidge.\n Davis did not seek public office again after 1924 but remained a prominent attorney, representing many of the country's largest businesses. Over a 60-year legal career, he argued 140 cases before the United States Supreme Court. He famously argued the winning side in Youngstown Steel, in which the Supreme Court ruled against President Harry Truman's seizure of the nation's steel plants. Davis also unsuccessfully defended the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Briggs v. Elliott, one of the companion cases to Brown v. Board of Education.",
  "/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University": "Washington and Lee University (Washington and Lee or W&L) is a private liberal arts university in Lexington, Virginia. Established in 1749, the university is a colonial-era college and the ninth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.\n Washington and Lee's 325-acre campus sits at the edge of Lexington and abuts the campus of the Virginia Military Institute in the Shenandoah Valley region between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains. The campus is approximately 50 miles (80\u00a0km) northeast from Roanoke, 140 miles (230\u00a0km) west from the state capital of Richmond, and 180 miles (290\u00a0km) inland southwest from the national capital at Washington, D.C.\n Washington and Lee was originally founded as a small classical school named Augusta Academy (later renamed Liberty Hall Academy) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though the university has never claimed any sectarian affiliation. In 1796, shortly before the end of his second term as US President, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at that time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for the commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), president at the Federal Constitutional Convention meeting in Philadelphia (summer of 1787), framer of the American Constitution (1787\u20131788), and the first President of the United States (1789\u20131797).\n In 1865, shortly after his April 9 surrender to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Armies, former Confederate States Army General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee (1807\u20131870) was called and served as president of the college for five years until his death in 1870, when the college was thereafter renamed the \"Washington and Lee University\".\nOne of the oldest institutions of higher education in the American South, W&L is the second-oldest in the Commonwealth of Virginia (next to the College of William & Mary, founded in 1693).\n The university consists of three academic units: the college itself; the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics; and the School of Law.

His father was a car dealer. He attended the University of Washington and earned a law degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He later became a lawyer in the Navy at the rank of captain.\n After the end of World War II, Harris was selected to be part of the legal team led by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson that began the prosecution of war criminals in Nuremberg, Germany. Harris led the team's case against Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking leader of the Nazi Security Police to face trial. He was successful in winning a conviction against Kaltenbrunner for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was also responsible for interrogating Rudolf Franz Ferdinand Hoess, the former commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp. For his work in the Nuremberg trials, Harris was decorated with the Legion of Merit.\n In February 2002, Washington University School of Law's \"Institute for Global Legal Studies\" was renamed to the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute in honor and recognition of Harris' lifelong achievements in the field of international justice, and his support of legal education and research.\n During an Experts' Meeting of The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative of the Institute in 2010 at the Brookings Institution, Harris made a plea just prior to his death to the legal experts, members of civil society and diplomats who were present. He stated. \"Following the trials, the Genocide Convention was adopted in 1948, criminalizing the Nazis' attempt to exterminate European Jewry. The Geneva Conventions were elaborated in 1949, codifying the laws of war.  But crimes against humanity- one of the most revolutionary and important elements of the Nuremberg Charter itself - were never set out in a treaty until the adoption of the International Criminal Court Statute in the summer of 1998. Practically speaking, what that means is that the words uttered after Nuremberg 'And never again' have but a hollow significance. My friends, this initiative of the Institute that bears my name is the first serious international effort to fill this gap, complete this work, and fulfill the Nuremberg legacy.\"[This quote needs a citation]\n Harris spoke of the institutional evil of the Nazi regime in Germany during an interview in 2008: \"Society lays the groundwork, and we develop in that society... We become part of that society, we're captivated by it, and we might do evil, too. It makes you wonder about where is the future of mankind - is evil going to triumph ultimately, or is good going to triumph? You have to find the good instincts that are in all of us.\"\n Seeing environmental conservation as another important component in promoting good in the world, Harris was also a founding member of the Development Board of the International Center for Tropical Ecology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The center was renamed the Whitney R. Harris World Ecology Center after a significant donation in 2006.\n Harris was married three times.

At the beginning of 1940, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country. The British initially declined to do so; however, in April 1940, a joint declaration was issued by the British, French and Polish. Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations, it proclaimed the trio's \"desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished.\"\n Three-and-a-half years later, the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States published their \"Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe\", which gave a \"full warning\" that, when the Nazis were defeated, the Allies would \"pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth\u00a0... in order that justice may be done.\u00a0...

Men may be initiated into Phi Kappa Psi either by an active chapter, or as part of a colony that is being installed as a chapter.
