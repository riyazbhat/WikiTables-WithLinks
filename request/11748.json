The expedition was commanded by Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry, under orders from American President Millard Fillmore. Perry\u2019s primary goal was to force an end to Japan\u2019s 220-year-old policy of isolation and to open Japanese ports to American trade, through the use of gunboat diplomacy if necessary. The Perry Expedition led directly to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the western \"Great Powers\", and eventually to the collapse of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration. Following the expedition, Japan's burgeoning trade routes with the world led to the cultural trend of Japonism, in which aspects of Japanese culture influenced art in Europe and America.",
