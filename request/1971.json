The station is owned by the Clearbrook Mennonite Brethren Church. It is presently not carried on any cable providers. The station was created mainly because many senior citizens, who make up a large portion of the church's congregation, are unable to attend services in person, thus a broadcast television station would give them the opportunity to watch those services on television. Clearbrook Mennonite Brethren Church was granted a licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to operate a low-power UHF television transmitter in the spring of 1999. After the station and its transmitter were set up and tested, CFEG went on the air for the first time in July 2000. The station's antenna is mounted on the roof of the church. CFEG's programming consists of the church's English and German Sunday morning and evening services as well as its Wednesday morning German Bible study.",
  "/wiki/Independent_station_(North_America)": "An independent station is a type of television station broadcasting in the United States or Canada that is not affiliated with any broadcast television network; most commonly, these stations carry a mix of syndicated, brokered and in some cases, local programming to fill time periods when network programs typically would air. Stations that are affiliated with networks such as The CW, MyNetworkTV or to a lesser degree, even Fox may be considered to be quasi-independent stations as these networks mainly provide programming during primetime, with limited to no network-supplied content in other time periods.\n Independent radio is a similar concept with regards to community radio stations, although with a slightly different meaning (as many non-indie commercial broadcasting radio stations produce the vast majority of their own programming, perhaps retaining only a nominal affiliation with a radio network for news updates or syndicated radio programming).",

The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east, and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits, respectively. The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years.

The community consists of two Cree First Nations communities \u2013 one on the Ermineskin 138 reserve to the north and the other on the Samson 137 reserve to the south. It also consists of an adjacent hamlet within Ponoka County. The community also serves three more nearby First Nations reserves including Samson 137A to the south, Louis Bull 138B to the northwest, and Montana 139 to the south. The area was originally known as Maskwacis, and Father Constantine Scollen always referred to it as Bear Hills when he attempted to re-establish a Catholic mission there, in late 1884 and 1885, around the time that he and Chief Bobtail succeeded in persuading the young men not to join the North-West Rebellion. The first railway station was named Hobbema after the Dutch painter Meindert Hobbema during the construction of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in 1891. As a result, all of Hobbema's neighbouring communities came to bear names of First Nations origin (Ponoka (elk), Menaik (spruce), Wetaskiwin (hills where peace was made)), with the exception of Hobbema itself. The community, including the hamlet portion within Ponoka County, was renamed Maskwacis (meaning bear hills in Cree) on January 1, 2014.",
