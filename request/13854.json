Consisting of the city of Winnipeg, the district originally existed from 1870 to 1883, returning a single member to the assembly. The district was named Winnipeg and St. John for the election of 1870 only, and Winnipeg thereafter.\n In 1883, it was divided into the new districts of Winnipeg North and Winnipeg South; a third district of Winnipeg Centre was created in 1888.\n In 1920, the district was reconstituted as a multiple member district, which returned ten members to the legislature who were all elected citywide under the Hare quota form of single transferable vote. The district existed in this form until 1949, when the city was divided again into the three districts of Winnipeg North, South and Centre, although each of the three districts continued to elect four members by STV until 1958, when all districts in the province reverted to conventional first-past-the-post voting.",

He was a cabinet minister in Thomas Greenway's government from 1889 to 1900, and served as the seventh Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1900 to 1911.\n McMillan was born in Whitby, Canada West (now Ontario), and was educated there and at Collingwood.  His initial career goal was to be a professional soldier.  He saw active service on the Niagara frontier in 1864, and was involved in repelling a Fenian raid in 1866.  In 1870, he served in the expedition of Col. Wolseley which ended the Red River Rebellion.  He eventually became a Major in the 95th Battalion, and was promoted to a command position on June 17, 1887.\n McMillan settled in Winnipeg following the Wolseley expedition, and became a successful businessman within the city.  He established a milling and grain business in Winnipeg in 1874, and oversaw the first shipment of western Canadian wheat to Minneapolis shortly thereafter. He also served as the first president of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for one year (1887\u20131888), served too as a Director and later Vice-President of the Great-West Life Assurance Company.\n McMillan became politically active during this period.  In 1879, he ran for the Manitoba legislature in the riding of Winnipeg against Thomas Scott, the leader of the opposition to John Norquay's government.  Norquay was supported by both Liberals and Conservatives at the time, and McMillan was a prominent member of the Winnipeg Liberal community.  Despite strong backing from the Manitoba Free Press, however, he lost to Scott by 387 votes to 321.\n The 1879 election was unusual even by the standards of early Manitoba politics, in that both Norquay and Scott claimed the support of a majority of elected members after the results were announced.  Eventually, Norquay consolidated his hold over the government and Scott departed for federal politics.  On December 4, 1880, McMillan was elected for Winnipeg in a by-election, defeating Alexander Logan.\n Norquay would gradually break his ties with the Winnipeg Liberals over the next two years, and forged an alliance with the province's Conservative establishment in 1882.  It may be assumed that McMillan had crossed into the opposition by this time.  He was never a cabinet minister under Norquay, and did not run for re-election in 1883.\n Thomas Greenway's Liberals were called to form a government in January 1888, and won a landslide majority in a general election held later in the year.  McMillan was returned to parliament for the riding of Winnipeg Centre in this election, defeating Conservative Thomas Gilroy by 972 votes to 470.  He was not immediately called into Greenway's cabinet, but was named Provincial Treasurer on May 7, 1889.  He held this position for the remainder of Greenway's time as Premier, and was given the additional portfolio of Provincial Lands Commissioner on October 7, 1896.  He had no difficulty being re-elected in 1892, and won unopposed in 1896.\n Greenway's Liberals were defeated by the Conservatives under Hugh John Macdonald in 1899, although McMillan retained his seat over Conservative A.J. Andrews by 1364 votes to 1249.  On October 9, 1900, he was appointed as the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba by Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier.  The post was mostly ceremonial by this time, and McMillan had little practical influence over the governments of Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin.  He was knighted in 1902, and stepped down from the Lt.

He moved to Manitoba in 1871, and became a mill owner and general merchant, also serving on the Protestant school board.\n Manitoba's boundaries were expanded in 1881, and Davidson was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election as the first member for Dauphin.  A Liberal, he defeated his sole opponent, P.S. St. Clair McGregor, 148 votes to 17.\n Party affiliations were fluid in Manitoba in this period, and by the general election of 1883 Davidson was identifying himself as a Liberal-Conservative, and a supporter of Premier John Norquay.  He was re-elected in Dauphin without opposition.\n Following redistribution, Davidson campaigned in the Beautiful Plains constituency for the provincial election of 1886.  The Liberals saw their support rise in this campaign, and Davidson (now a Conservative) lost to Liberal John Crawford by thirty votes.  Crawford again defeated Davidson in the 1888 election, this time by twenty-four votes.\n Provincial support for the Conservatives recovered slightly in the 1892 election, and Davidson defeated Crawford by sixteen votes in their third encounter.  The opposition caucus to which he belonged initially chose William Alexander Macdonald as its leader.  When Macdonald's constituency election was overturned in 1893, Davidson was chosen in his place.  He made his first speech as leader of the opposition in January 1894.  Davidson was a moderate figure, whose interventions were respected by the province's Liberal leadership.\n He did not serve as opposition leader for long.  His constituency victory was also overturned on April 17, 1894, and he was subsequently defeated by John Forsyth of the Patrons of Industry in a by-election.  After his loss, the leadership of the opposition seems to have fallen to James Fisher, an Independent MLA.  Davidson again lost to a Patrons of Industry candidate in the 1896 election.\n Though the Conservatives returned to government in the 1899 election, Davidson was once again defeated in Beautiful Plains, losing to Liberal Robert Ennis by ninety votes.

It was created by the province's first electoral redistribution in 1874 and existed until 2011, except for the period from 1914 to 1920.\n Springfield was located to the immediate east of the City of Winnipeg. It was bordered to the north by Selkirk and Gimli, to the east by Lac Du Bonnet and to the south by La Verendrye. The riding included the municipalities of Springfield and East St. Paul, as well as Anola, Dugald, Birds Hill and Oakbank. Before 1989, the riding stretched as far as the Ontario border.\n The riding's population in 1996 was 18,599. In 1999, the average family income was $67,794, and the unemployment rate was 4.50%. Manufacturing accounted for 12% of all industry in the riding, followed by 11% in the service sector. Springfield had significant Ukrainian and German populations, at 9% and 8% respectively.\n Springfield was represented by various political parties over its long history, without any one party dominating for an extended period of time. This pattern hd begun to change, as the riding had been represented by the Progressive Conservatives since 1990, and the last member, Member of the Legislative Assembly, Ron Schuler, was re-elected with over 60% of the vote in 2003.  The seat was considered safe for the Progressive Conservatives.\n Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was dissolved into La Verendrye and the new riding of St. Paul. This took effect for the 2011 election.",
