  "/wiki/U.S._Route_50": "U.S. Route 50 or U.S. Highway 50 (US\u00a050) is a major east\u2013west route of the U.S. Highway system, stretching just over 3,000 miles (4,800\u00a0km) from Interstate 80 (I-80) in West Sacramento, California, to Maryland Route 528 (MD 528) in Ocean City, Maryland, on the Atlantic Ocean. Until 1972, when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area, it extended (by way of Stockton, the Altamont Pass, and the Bay Bridge) to San Francisco, near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of I-70 and I-80 and north of I-64 and I-40. The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the western United States, with the section through Nevada known as \"The Loneliest Road in America\". In the Midwest, US\u00a050 heads through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. The route continues into the eastern United States, where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington, D.C. From there, US\u00a050 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City. Signs at each end give the length as 3,073 miles (4,946\u00a0km), but the actual distance is slightly less, due to realignments since the former figure was measured. US\u00a050 passes through a total of 12 states; California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia.",
