The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (NL) was formed in Chicago, Illinois by businessman, and owner of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as, the Chicago Cubs), William Hulbert, for the purpose of replacing the NA, which he believed to have been corrupt, mismanaged, full of rowdy, drunken ballplayers, and under the influence of the gambling community.  One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more.  The initial NL season began with eight teams, and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21.  The NL is considered to be the first \"major league\", although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim.",

The team is the forerunner of, but not directly connected with, the current St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball team.  After the conclusion of the 1877 season, a game-fixing scandal involving two players the Brown Stockings had acquired led the team to resign its membership in the NL.  The club then declared bankruptcy and folded.\n The Brown Stockings did not meet a complete demise, however.  Organized by outfielder Ned Cuthbert, a few members of the former club continued to play the following year, though not now bound to any league.  They played whomever they could, wherever they could, and still managed to draw crowds and make a profit, leading to play again the following two years.  The Brown Stockings regained some of their former success \u2013 enough of it that, despite the recent scandal, fans of the team seemed to exhibit a short memory and began to show interest in recreating another professional St. Louis baseball team.  In 1881, when German immigrant Chris von der Ahe \u2014 owner of a grocery store and saloon who was initially ignorant about baseball \u2014 saw the popularity of the club, he bought them out and soon became interested in having the team compete in a professional league.  Together with beer magnates in five other cities, the American Association was formed in late 1881, and professional baseball flourished in St. Louis \u2014 this time, with the resurrected Brown Stockings the next year.",

  "/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles_(19th_century)": "The Baltimore Orioles were a 19th-century American Association and National League (organized 1876) baseball team from 1882 to 1899. The early ball club, which featured numerous future Hall of Famers, finished in first place three consecutive years (1894\u20131895\u20131896) and won the \"Temple Cup\" national championship series in 1896 and 1897. Despite their success, the dominant Orioles were contracted out of the League after the 1899 season, when the N.L. reduced its number of teams and franchises from 12 to 8, with a list of teams and cities limited to just the northeastern United States which endured for the next half-century. This controversial action resulting in the elevation of the former Western League by leaders such as Ban Johnson (1864-1931), into a newly-organized American League in 1901 of which the new reorganized Baltimore Orioles were a prominent member for its first two seasons which \"waged war\" on the elder \"Nationals\".",
  "/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_annual_shutout_leaders": "The following is a list of annual leaders in shutouts in Major League Baseball (MLB). A shutout occurs when a single pitcher throws a complete game and does not allow the opposing team to score a single run.\n Walter Johnson holds the career shutout record with 110. The most shutouts pitched in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). In the dead-ball era and throughout much of the first three-quarters of the twentieth century, starting pitchers were generally expected to perform complete games, and starting pitchers would throw dozens of complete games a year\u200a\u2014\u200athereby increasing a pitcher's chances of achieving a shutout. These shutout records are among the most secure records in baseball, as pitchers today rarely earn more than one or two shutouts per season with the heavy emphasis on pitch counts and relief pitching. Pitchers today will often pitch only a few, if any, complete games a season. The 2018 season marked a new low for complete-game shutouts; no pitcher threw for more than one shutout during the season, with eleven American League and seven National League pitchers finishing with only one shutout that season."
