The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (NL) was formed in Chicago, Illinois by businessman, and owner of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as, the Chicago Cubs), William Hulbert, for the purpose of replacing the NA, which he believed to have been corrupt, mismanaged, full of rowdy, drunken ballplayers, and under the influence of the gambling community.  One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more.  The initial NL season began with eight teams, and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21.
