It is the oldest parish in the western San Fernando Valley, having been established in 1921.

The 400 square miles (1,000 km2) served by Our Lady of the Valley were carved up among nine sister parishes. Though its territory has been reduced to four square miles, the parish has grown from 620 parishioners to over 4100 families. Msgr.",
