  "/wiki/Post_town": "A post town is a required part of all postal addresses in the United Kingdom and Ireland,  and a basic unit of the postal delivery system.  Including the correct post town in the address increases the chance of a letter or parcel being delivered on time. Post towns in general originated as the location of delivery offices. As of 2004[update], their main function is to distinguish between localities or street names in addresses not including a postcode.",

It lies on the north side of the Thames Estuary, 40 miles (64\u00a0km) east of central London. It is bordered to the north by Rochford and to the west by Castle Point. It is home to the longest leisure pier in the world, Southend Pier. London Southend Airport is located 1.5\u00a0NM (2.8\u00a0km; 1.7\u00a0mi) north of the town centre.\n Southend-on-Sea originally consisted of a few poor fishermen's huts and farms at the southern end of the village of Prittlewell. In the 1790s, the first buildings around what was to become the High Street of Southend were completed. In the 19th century, Southend's status of a seaside resort grew after a visit from Princess Caroline of Brunswick, and Southend Pier was constructed. From the 1960s onwards, the town declined as a holiday destination, Southend redeveloped itself as the home of the Access credit card, due to it having one of the UK's first electronic telephone exchanges. After the 1960s, much of the town centre was developed for commerce and retail, and many original structures were lost to redevelopment. An annual seafront airshow, started in 1986 when it featured a flypast by Concorde, used to take place each May until 2012.",
  "/wiki/PO_Box": "A post office box (commonly abbreviated as P.O. box, or also known as a postal box) is a uniquely addressable lockable box located on the premises of a post office station.\n In some regions, particularly in Africa, there is no door to door delivery of mail; for example, in Kenya. Consequently, renting a PO box has traditionally been the only way to receive mail in such countries. However, some countries, like Egypt, have introduced mail home delivery.\n Generally, post office boxes are rented from the post office either by individuals or by businesses on a basis ranging from monthly to annual, and the cost of rent varies depending on the box size. Central business district (CBD) PO boxes are usually more expensive than rural PO boxes.\n In the United States, the rental rate used to be[when?] uniform across the country. Now, however, a postal facility can be in any of seven fee groups by location; in addition, certain customers qualify for free box rental, usually because the Postal Service does not offer carrier-route delivery to their physical addresses.\n In the United Kingdom, Royal Mail PO boxes are often little more than pigeon-holes in the secure section of a sorting office and are accessible only by staff. In such cases, the renter of the PO box will be issued with a card showing the PO box number and delivery office name and must produce this to the desk staff when collecting mail. For an additional fee, the Royal Mail will deliver received items to the renter's geographical address.\n Some private companies (e.g., United Parcel Service and commercial mail receiving agencies) offer similar services of renting a mailbox in a public location. The difference is that mail sent there is addressed to a street address (along with the private box number), instead of just addressed to \"PO Box CSX\".",
  "/wiki/Non-geographic_postcodes": "Postal codes used in the United Kingdom are known as postcodes (originally, postal codes). They are alphanumeric and were adopted nationally between 11 October 1959 and 1974, having been devised by the General Post Office (Royal Mail). A full postcode is known as a \"postcode unit\" and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point.\n The structure of a postcode is two alphanumeric codes, the first having between two and four characters and the second, three characters. First, one or two letters indicate the postcode area, followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area. This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district, and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street. Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city (such as B for Birmingham) but may also be geographic in nature (such as HS for Outer Hebrides). \n Each postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one (or more) postcode districts. (Example: a sizeable part of Southern England is covered by the GU postcode area, named for the town of Guildford. Guildford comprises postal districts GU1 and GU2. Nearby Woking, a major commuter town 6 miles distant, is a post town within postal district GU22.) The central part of the town or city the postcode area is named after will have the number one e.g. B1 (Birmingham), LS1 (Leeds), M1 (Manchester), however other post towns within the area are then either treated alphabetically - particularly in London (e.g. Chingford on the north-eastern edge of London being E4, whereas adjacent Walthamstow to the south being E17) or geographically (e.g. the Outer Hebrides area HS numbering the districts north to south). \n As a general rule, large post towns are numbered from the centre out such that outlying parts have higher numbered districts, but the disparate post towns within a postal area can be numbered based on various criteria (the town the postal area is named after excepted, this always being 1). In particular, one cannot reliably infer the centrality of a postcode district within a postcode area from the postcode alone, as for instance SE1 covers a large part of Central London south of the Thames whereas SE2 covers Abbey Wood at the far end of the Elizabeth Line. See postcode area.\n Postcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the sorting of mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in route planning software and as the lowest level of aggregation in census enumeration. The boundaries of each postcode unit and within these the full address data of currently about 29\u00a0million addresses (delivery points) are stored, maintained and periodically updated in the Postcode Address File database.\n The initial system of named postal districts, developed in London and other large cities from 1857, evolved towards the present form: in 1917 London was split into broad numbered subdivisions, and this extended to the other cities in 1934. Since the local government reorganisation of London in the 1960s, parts of Greater London lie outside the London postal area. These include large parts of the \"TW\", \"KT\", \"SM\", \"CR\", \"HA\", and \"UB\" postcode areas, among a few others.\n As examples of the postcode system, the postcode of the University of Roehampton in London is SW15 5PU, where SW stands for south-west London; the postcode of GCHQ is GL51 0EX, where GL signifies the postal area of Gloucester. The postal town can be a wide area and does not relate to a specific town, county or region. GL51 is one of the postcodes for the town of Cheltenham (in Gloucestershire).\n Theoretically, deliveries can reach their destination using the house number (or name if the house has no number) and postcode alone; however, this is against Royal Mail guidelines, which request the use of a full address.",

Benton's book discusses a document that discloses the existence in the reign of Elizabeth I  of a bridge here.\n The OED defines \"wholve\" as a \"short\narched or covered drain under a path.\" The word appears to be local to this part of Essex. This definition may cast doubt on it being the old name for the Crouch but may suggest this is the form of the bridge\n Along the river bank there are remains of evaporation pans where salt was made in Bronze Age times.\nAs captured by well renowned Countryside historian Oliver Rackham in his publication \"History of Countryside\" The field structures in and around Hullbridge and South Woodham Ferrers were formed during the Iron Age so an ancient settlement in or around Hullbridge is highly likely especially given the Saxon Burial ground finds in Rawreth when the Park school was being built.\n Before the coming of the railways to Rayleigh, Hullbridge's wharf's were important for the distribution of various commodities especially, coal and shale. It was from here that Rayleigh received such goods.

It is part of the new town of Basildon. \n During the creation of the new town of Basildon in the late 1940s and early 1950s, \"Pitsea\" (as well \"Vange\" and \"Laindon\") were considered as names for the new town. Because Basildon village was central to the district, the town was named \"Basildon\". Before the new town regeneration, Pitsea was made up of plot lands and was regarded as run down.",
  "/wiki/Basildon": "Basildon (/\u02c8b\u00e6z\u026ald\u0259n/ BAZ-il-d\u0259n) is the largest town in the borough of Basildon with a population of 107,123 in the county of Essex, England.\n It lies 26 miles (42\u00a0km) east of Central London, 11 miles (18\u00a0km) south of the city of Chelmsford and 10 miles (16\u00a0km) west of Southend-on-Sea. Nearby smaller towns include Billericay to the northwest, Wickford northeast and South Benfleet to the southeast. It was created as a new town after World War II in 1948 to accommodate the London population overspill, from the conglomeration of four small villages, namely Pitsea, Laindon, Basildon (the most central of the four) and Vange.\n The local government district of Basildon, which was formed in 1974 and received borough status in 2010, encapsulates a larger area than the town itself; the two neighbouring towns of Billericay and Wickford, as well as rural villages and smaller settlements set among the surrounding countryside, fall within its borders. Basildon Town is one of the most densely populated areas in the county.\n Some of Basildon's residents work in Central London due to the town being well connected in the county to the City of London and the Docklands financial and corporate headquarters districts, with a 36\u201358 minute journey from the three Basildon stations to London Fenchurch Street.

  "/wiki/Value_Added_Tax_(United_Kingdom)": "In the United Kingdom, the value-added tax (or value added tax, VAT) was introduced in 1973, replacing Purchase Tax, and is the third-largest source of government revenue, after income tax and National Insurance. It is administered and collected by HM Revenue and Customs, primarily through the Value Added Tax Act 1994.\n VAT is levied on most goods and services provided by registered businesses in the UK and some goods and services imported from outside the European Union. There are complex regulations for goods and services imported from within the EU. The default VAT rate is the standard rate, 20% since 4 January 2011. Some goods and services are subject to VAT at a reduced rate of 5% (such as domestic fuel) or 0% (such as most food and children's clothing). Others are exempt from VAT or outside the system altogether.\n Under EU law, the standard rate of VAT in any EU state cannot be lower than 15%. Each state may have up to two reduced rates of at least 5% for a restricted list of goods and services. The European Council must approve any temporary reduction of VAT in the public interest.\n VAT is an indirect tax because the tax is paid to the government by the seller (the business) rather than the person who ultimately bears the economic burden of the tax (the consumer). Opponents of VAT claim it is a regressive tax because the poorest people spend a higher proportion of their disposable income on VAT than the richest people. Those in favour of VAT claim it is progressive as consumers who spend more pay more VAT.",
