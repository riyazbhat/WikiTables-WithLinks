  "/wiki/Medicine_Lake_Volcano": "Medicine Lake Volcano is a large shield volcano in northeastern California  about 30 miles (50\u00a0km) northeast of Mount Shasta. The volcano is located in a zone of east-west crustal extension east of the main axis of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range. The 0.6-mile (1\u00a0km) thick shield is 22 miles (35\u00a0km) from east to west and 28 to 31 miles (45 to 50\u00a0km) from north to south, and covers more than 770 square miles (2,000\u00a0km2). The underlying rock has downwarped by 0.3 miles (0.5\u00a0km) under the center of the volcano. The volcano is primarily composed of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows, and has a 4.3-by-7.5-mile (7 by 12\u00a0km) caldera at the center.",
  "/wiki/Shield_volcano": "A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually composed almost entirely of fluid lava flows. It is named for its low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid (low viscosity) lava erupted, which travels farther than lava erupted from a stratovolcano, and results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form.",
  "/wiki/Rainbow_Mountain_(California)": "Rainbow Mountain is a stratovolcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County, California. It is located between Mount Shasta and the Medicine Lake Volcano, consisting of andesitic and dacitic rocks that were produced during the Early Pleistocene subepoch. Its last known eruption is also of Pleistocene age.",
  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice and ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far, due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi).",
  "/wiki/Mount_Shasta": "Mount Shasta (Karuk: \u00daytaahkoo or \"White Mountain\") is a potentially active volcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County, California. At an elevation of 14,179 feet (4321.8\u00a0m), it is the second-highest peak in the Cascades and the fifth-highest in the state. Mount Shasta has an estimated volume of 85 cubic miles (350\u00a0km3), which makes it the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.\nThe mountain and surrounding area are part of the Shasta\u2013Trinity National Forest.",
  "/wiki/Shastina": "Shastina is the highest satellite cone of Mount Shasta, and one of four overlapping volcanic cones which together form the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Range.  At 12,335 feet (3,760\u00a0m), Shastina is taller than Mount Adams and would rank as the third highest volcano in the Cascades behind Mount Rainier and Shasta were it not nestled on the western flank of its higher neighbor.  Shastina has a topographic prominence of over 450\u00a0ft (137\u00a0m) above the saddle connecting it with Shasta and easily exceeds the typical mountaineering standard of 300 feet (91\u00a0m) for a peak to qualify as an independent summit, yet most lists of Cascade volcanoes omit it nonetheless.  The name \"Shastina\" is a diminutive of Shasta.",
  "/wiki/Black_Butte_(California)": "Black Butte is a cluster of overlapping dacite lava domes in a butte,\na satellite cone of Mount Shasta.  It is located directly adjacent to Interstate 5 at milepost 742 between the city of Mount Shasta and Weed, California. The highway crosses a 3,912\u00a0ft (1,192\u00a0m) pass, Black Butte Summit, at the western base of the lava domes. The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of Shastina following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000\u201310,000 years ago.",
  "/wiki/Lava_dome": "In volcanology, a lava dome is a circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. Dome-building eruptions are common, particularly in convergent plate boundary settings. Around 6% of eruptions on earth are lava dome forming. The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt (e.g. Semeru, 1946) to rhyolite (e.g. Chaiten, 2010) although the majority are of intermediate composition (such as Santiaguito, dacite-andesite, present day) The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far. This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways: by high levels of silica in the magma, or by degassing of fluid magma. Since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite.",
  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present (BP) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology, geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past. Because the \"present\" time changes, standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date (epoch) of the age scale,[a] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s. The abbreviation \"BP\" has been interpreted retrospectively as \"Before Physics\"; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, making dating after that time likely to be unreliable.",
  "/wiki/Brushy_Butte": "Brushy Butte is a small, poorly studied, shield volcano located immediately east of Timbered Crater, south-southeast of the Medicine Lake Highlands in northern California, U.S. (near where Siskiyou County, California is adjacent to Shasta County, California).",
  "/wiki/Big_Cave": "Big Cave is a small shield volcano located in northern California in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of the Pacific Northwest. With an elevation listed at either 4,130 feet (1,260\u00a0m) or 4,131 feet (1,259\u00a0m), it is the product of subduction of several tectonic plates under the North American Plate, which continues at a rate of 4 centimetres (1.6\u00a0in) each year.",
  "/wiki/Twin_Buttes_(California)": "The Twin Buttes are a group of volcanic cinder cones located in the Cascade Mountain Range of Shasta County, California.",
  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as either volcanic clinkers, volcanic ash, or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent. The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical; with slopes between 30\u201340\u00b0; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.",
  "/wiki/Fissure_vent": "A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure, eruption fissure or simply a fissure, is a linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is often a few metres wide and may be many kilometres long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts which run first in lava channels and later in lava tubes. After some time the eruption builds up spatter cones and may concentrate on one or some of them. Small fissure vents may not be easily discernible from the air, but the crater rows (see Laki) or the canyons (see Eldgj\u00e1) built up by some of them are.",
  "/wiki/Cinder_Cone_and_the_Fantastic_Lava_Beds": "Cinder Cone is a cinder cone volcano in Lassen Volcanic National Park within the United States. It is located about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) northeast of Lassen Peak and provides an excellent view of Brokeoff Mountain, Lassen Peak, and Chaos Crags.",
  "/wiki/Chaos_Crags": "Chaos Crags is the youngest group of lava domes in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California. They formed as six dacite domes 1,100-1,000 years ago, one dome collapsing during an explosive eruption about 70 years later. The eruptions at the Chaos Crags mark one of just three instances of Holocene activity within the Lassen volcanic center. The cluster of domes is located north of Lassen Peak and form part of the southernmost segment of the Cascade Range in Northern California. Each year, a lake forms at the base of the Crags, and typically dries by the end of the summer season.",
