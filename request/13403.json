  "/wiki/Basilan": "The Province of Basilan (Chavacano: Provincia de Basilan; Tausug: Wilaya' sin Basilan; Yakan: Wilayah Basilanin) is an island province of the Philippines in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Basilan Island is the largest and northernmost of the major islands of the Sulu Archipelago. It is just off the southern coast of the geographic Zamboanga Peninsula. Isabela City, the former capital, is a component city under the provincial government of Basilan but is administered as part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region and is listed statistically independent. Its capital has been transferred to Lamitan City. Basilan is home to three main ethnolingusitic groups: the indigenous Yakans, and the later-arriving Tausugs and Chavacanos. The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are mainly Christian. There are a number of smaller nations.",
  "/wiki/Autonomous_Region_in_Muslim_Mindanao": "The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Tagalog: Rehiyong Awtonomo ng Muslim Mindanao; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u064a \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0627\u0648  Al-\u1e25ukm adh-dh\u0101tiyy al-'aql\u012bmiyy limuslimiyy mindan\u0101u; abbreviated as ARMM) was an autonomous region of the Philippines, located in the Mindanao island group of the Philippines, that consisted of five predominantly Muslim provinces: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. It was the only region that had its own government. The region's de facto seat of government was Cotabato City, although this self-governing city was outside its jurisdiction. The ARMM included the province of Shariff Kabunsuan from its creation in 2006 until 16 July 2008, when Shariff Kabunsuan ceased to exist as a province after the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act 201, which created it, unconstitutional in Sema vs. COMELEC. On October 7, 2012, President Benigno Aquino III said that the government aimed to have peace in the autonomous region and that it would become known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, a compound of bangsa (nation) and Moro. On July 26, 2018, Aquino's successor, President Rodrigo Duterte, signed the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which paved the way for the establishment of a new autonomous political entity in the area, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). ARMM was nominally disestablished after the ratification of BOL and will be effectively replaced by the BARMM upon the constitution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, an interim government for the region. The law was  deemed ratified on January 25, 2019 following the January 21 plebiscite.",
  "/wiki/Automatic_rifle": "An automatic rifle is a type of self-loading rifle that is capable of automatic fire. Automatic rifles are select-fire weapons that are capable of firing in semi-automatic and automatic firing modes (some automatic rifles are capable of burst-fire as well). Automatic rifles are distinguished from semi-automatic rifles in their ability to fire more than one shot in succession once the trigger is pulled. Most automatic rifles are further subcategorized as battle rifles.",

  "/wiki/Rocket-propelled_grenade": "A rocket-propelled grenade (often abbreviated RPG) is a shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon system that fires rockets equipped with an explosive warhead. Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs, with some exceptions, are generally loaded from the muzzle. RPGs with high explosive anti-tank warheads (HEAT) are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers (APCs). However, heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored (with thick composite and/or reactive armor) to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of vehicle are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other unarmored targets.",

The name of the group is derived from the Arabic abu (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 ) (father of), and sayyaf (Arabic: \u0633\u064a\u0651\u0627\u0641 ) (swordsmith).

  "/wiki/Grenade": "A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand, but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers. Generally, a grenade consists of an explosive charge, a detonating mechanism, and firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism. Once the soldier throws the grenade, the safety lever releases, the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer. The primer explodes and ignites the fuze (sometimes called the delay element). The fuze burns down to the detonator, which explodes the main charge. There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation (frag), high explosive (HE) concussion and smoke grenades. Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies. They are missiles designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation.",

  "/wiki/Jeepney": "Jeepneys (Filipino: Dyipni), sometimes called simply jeeps (Filipino: dyip), are buses and the most popular means of public transportation ubiquitous in the Philippines. They are known for their crowded seating and kitsch decorations, which have become a wide spread symbol of Philippine culture and art. A Sarao jeepney was exhibited at the Philippine pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair as a national image for the Filipinos. Jeepneys were originally made from U.S. military jeeps left over from World War II. The word jeepney is likely a portmanteau word \u2013 a combination of jeep and jitney, both words common slang in the popular vernacular of the era: jitney being a popular term for an American taxicab, and a jeep a newly coined term to describe a type of military vehicle (origin from General Purpose, or GP, hence Jeep). Other sources favor the far less likely explanation that it is a portmanteau of jeep and knee, because the passengers sit very close to each other. Most jeepneys are used as public utility vehicles. Some are used as personal vehicles.",
  "/wiki/Police": "The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder. Their lawful powers include arrest and the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes. Law enforcement is only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property.",
