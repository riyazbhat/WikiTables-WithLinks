  "/wiki/Carson_Valley_Hospital": "The Carson Valley Hospital is a historic hospital located at 1466 U.S. Route 395 in Gardnerville, Nevada. The hospital was built in 1914 by Dr. E. H. Hawkins, the county physician and health officer of Douglas County. The hospital was regarded as one of Nevada's best, and it included modern tools such as an X-ray machine, a rarity in small town hospitals at the time. While Hawkins anticipated that Douglas County would need a modern hospital for its growing population, the county's population actually fell at the 1920 census, and the community struggled to keep its hospital open. Hawkins sold the hospital in 1918, and it closed in 1924. The building was used for housing until 1958, when it was vacated.",

  "/wiki/United_States_Route_50": "U.S. Route 50 or U.S. Highway 50 (US\u00a050) is a major east\u2013west route of the U.S. Highway system, stretching just over 3,000 miles (4,800\u00a0km) from Interstate 80 (I-80) in West Sacramento, California, to Maryland Route 528 (MD 528) in Ocean City, Maryland, on the Atlantic Ocean. Until 1972, when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area, it extended (by way of Stockton, the Altamont Pass, and the Bay Bridge) to San Francisco, near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of I-70 and I-80 and north of I-64 and I-40. The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the western United States, with the section through Nevada known as \"The Loneliest Road in America\". In the Midwest, US\u00a050 heads through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. The route continues into the eastern United States, where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington, D.C. From there, US\u00a050 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City. Signs at each end give the length as 3,073 miles (4,946\u00a0km), but the actual distance is slightly less, due to realignments since the former figure was measured.

Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.",
