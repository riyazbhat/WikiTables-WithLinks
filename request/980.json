  "/wiki/George_Derby_(baseball)": "George Henry Derby (July 6, 1857 \u2013 July 4, 1925), nicknamed \"Jonah\", was a professional baseball player from 1877 to 1883.  He played three seasons in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Detroit Wolverines in 1881 and 1882 and for the Buffalo Bisons in 1883.\n Derby won 29 games and led the National League in both strikeouts and shutouts as a 24-year-old rookie in 1881.  However, after pitching 55 complete games and almost 500 innings in 1881, Derby developed shoulder problems that reduced the velocity of his pitches.  His career was cut short, and he played in his final major league game in July 1883 at age 25.",
  "/wiki/Buffalo_Bisons_(NL)": "The original Buffalo Bisons baseball club played in the National League between 1879 and 1885. The Bisons played their games at Riverside Park (1879\u201383) and Olympic Park (1884-85) in Buffalo, New York. The NL Bisons are included in the history of the minor-league team of the same name that still plays today; it is thus the only extant NL team from the 19th century that both still exists and no longer plays in Major League Baseball.",
  "/wiki/Recreation_Park_(Detroit)": "Recreation Park was a ballpark located in Detroit. It is best known as the home of the Detroit Wolverines of the National League from 1881 to 1888.\n Recreation Park was built in 1879. Its developers intended it to be a multi-use facility. There was a half-mile dirt track running along the outside of the property to be used for horse racing, bicycling and foot races. The owners also envisioned use for baseball, cricket, archery, croquet, as well as ice skating in the winter.\n Detroit fielded a minor league team that summer. Two years later the Wolverines major league team made its debut. The first major league baseball game in Detroit was played here on May 2nd, 1881.\n As the 1880s progressed, the team improved and won the National League pennant in 1887, as well as the World Series, defeating the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. By the end of the next season, the club was losing money in spite of its successes, and dropped out of the league. Minor league ball resumed in 1889 and was played for two seasons (plus one game in 1891) before the club folded altogether. Recreation Park continued to be used for various other activities, but by 1894 it was pretty much abandoned, and the structures were demolished.\n The Park was on a rectangular site north of the downtown area, less than a mile from the location of the future Comerica Park. The field was laid out so that the foul lines hit the fences at a 135\u00b0 angle, similar to the Polo Grounds and various other parks of that era. It was bounded on the south by Brady Street, on the east by Beaubien Street, and on the west by Harper Hospital, beyond which lay John R Street. Brush Street made a T-intersection against Brady at the southwest corner of the lot where the main entrance gate was. For that reason, the location is often given as simply \"Brady and Brush Streets.\"\n Across the centerfield fence, to the north, was the other half of the Recreation Park complex, a cricket field. Contemporary maps depict an oval track around the cricket field, as with the baseball field, and a larger oval enclosing the entire property. The northern boundary of the property, according to initial contemporary newspaper accounts, was Fremont Street (now Canfield Street). Later accounts placed the northern border at Willis Street, a block south of Fremont / Canfield.\n Although the ballpark is long gone, Harper Hospital still exists, housed in new buildings, and overlooking the site where the major league Wolverines once played. An historical marker commemorating Recreation Park is placed in what was once left field, among the buildings of the present Detroit Medical Center.",

  "/wiki/National_League_Park": "National League Park is the name of two former baseball grounds located in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

A contemporary plat map indicates the diamond was closest to the Kennard-Cedar intersection.\n The second National League Park was the home of the Cleveland Spiders of the American Association from 1887 to 1888 and of the National League from 1889 to 1890. This ground was located a few blocks northwest of the Kennard site.

  "/wiki/Philadelphia_Quakers_(NL)": "The history of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball's National League is a long and varied one. The Phillies are based in Philadelphia, and are a member of the National League East division. Since 2004, the team's home has been Citizens Bank Park in the South Philadelphia section of the city. The franchise has won two World Series championships (against Kansas City in 1980, Tampa Bay in 2008), and seven National League pennants.\n After replacing the Worcesters in 1883, the franchise made its first post-season appearance in 1915, losing to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. The Phillies franchise also has the second-longest streak of consecutive losing seasons in American professional sports, sixteen straight from 1933 to 1948; the record stood until 2009, when it was broken by the Pittsburgh Pirates. After another National League pennant in 1950, the Phillies did not return to the post-season until 1976, beginning a period of extended success for the franchise. Compared to the team's early days, the Phillies have recently been more successful than not, with two such periods: the first from 1975 to 1983, when they won five East Division championships as well as the first-half championship in the strike-shortened 1981 season, and the second starting in 2001, with a winning percentage of .534 in those eight seasons, finishing above .500 in all but one, and making the playoffs from 2007 through 2011.\n In its 127-season history, the franchise has employed 51\u00a0managers and 10\u00a0general managers (GMs). Dallas Green and Charlie Manuel are the only Phillies managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980, and Manuel in 2008. Manuel is also the only Phillies manager to win two pennants, and on the last day of the 2011 regular season, surpassed Gene Mauch's 644-win record as the winningest manager in franchise history, taking two fewer seasons than Mauch to accomplish that feat.  The longest-tenured general manager is Paul Owens, with 11 years of service to the team as the general manager, from 1972 to 1983. Owens also served as the team manager in 1972, and from 1983 to 1984. After this time, he served as a team executive until 2003, and was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in recognition of his services. The manager with the highest winning percentage over a full season or more was Arthur Irwin, whose .575\u00a0winning percentage is fourth on the all-time wins list for Phillies managers.",

He was the first German in MLB history.\n Getzien was known by the nickname \"Pretzels\".

The Wolverines used four Opening Day starting pitchers in their eight years as a Major League Baseball franchise.  The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor that is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Wolverines had a record of four wins and four losses in their Opening Day games.\n The first game in Detroit Wolverines history was played on May 2, 1881 against the Buffalo Bisons. George Derby was the Opening Day starting pitcher in that game, which the Wolverines lost by a score of 6\u20135.  The Wolverines' last Opening Day game was played on April 20, 1888 against the Pittsburgh Alleghenys (now known as the Pittsburgh Pirates).
