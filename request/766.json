The Zulu originated from Ngini communities who took part in the Bantu migrations. As the clans integrated together, the rulership of Shaka brought success to the Zulu nation due to his perfected military policies. The Zulu take pride in their ceremonies such as the Umhlanga, or Reed Dance, and their various forms of beadwork. The art and skill of beadwork takes part in the identification of Zulu people and acts as a form of communication. The men and women both serve different purposes in society in order to function as a whole. The Zulu predominately believe in Christianity, but have created a syncretic religion that is combined with the Zulu's prior belief systems.",

Beside of changing the players outfit to orange, the club also made an effort to maximise publicity of their new sponsor, by renaming the club to Dion Highlands F.C. in 1979.

Apparently this change however only lasted for a very short while in 1980, as the newspapers continued referring to the club as \"Dion Highlands F.C.\", in the subsequent years from 1981 to February 1983.",
