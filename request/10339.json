  "/wiki/Cullman_Downtown_Commercial_Historic_District": "The Cullman Downtown Commercial Historic District is a historic district in Cullman, Alabama. Cullman was founded in 1873 by John G. Cullmann, who purchased land from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Most early commercial buildings were constructed of wood, with the first brick building, a hotel and restaurant across from the L&N depot, completed in 1881. Most of the early wooden buildings burned, including the C. A. Stiefelmeyer Storehouse in 1892, which was replaced with the current Stiefelmeyer's building. A new post office building was constructed in 1910, at the same time as a major boom in construction. Following a lull during World War I, construction continued in the 1920s, including the First United Methodist Church in 1923. The majority of the 58 contributing structures in the district are one- or two-story brick buildings in basic commercial styles, some influenced by the Chicago School. Notable exceptions are the wooden Italianate Stiefelmeyer's building, the stone Gothic Revival First Methodist Church, and the Neoclassical Federal Building and German Bank building's corner cupola. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.",

In the early 20th century, many homes with Eastlake details were constructed. Beginning in the 1920s, many bungalows were built. After the 1930s, most houses built were more spartan, however some notable Jacobethan Revival are represented. Other notable buildings in the district are the Works Progress Administration-built East Elementary School (1936) and the St. John's United Church of Christ (1924).

  "/wiki/Louisville_and_Nashville_Railroad_Depot_(Cullman,_Alabama)": "The Louisville and Nashville Railroad Depot is a historic train station in Cullman, Alabama. The depot was built in 1913 as a replacement for Cullman's original station. Cullman's founder, John G. Cullmann, gave money to the city upon his death in 1895 to lower the Louisville and Nashville Railroad tracks through town, in order to reduce noise and pollution. The plan was not enacted until 1911, when the L&N laid double tracks through the town, necessitating the construction of a new depot. The depot served passengers until 1968, and was used for maintenance storage by new owners CSX until it was sold to the city in 1990. It was restored and now houses offices for the local United Way chapter. The depot is built in Mission Revival style, unique among otherwise standard and less stylized L&N depot designs. The center section of the three-bay building is separated by two piers which rise above the parapet. The piers have shallow pyramidal tops, and are decorated with recessed panels and horizontal banding. In the central bay lies the main entrance, covered by a hipped roof portico which is supported by heavy square columns and brackets.

  "/wiki/Stiefelmeyer's": "Stiefelmeyer's is a historic commercial building in Cullman, Alabama. The store was founded in 1888, and occupied a two-story frame storehouse until it was destroyed by fire in 1892. Although brick had already become the material of choice for commercial buildings in the town, the current Stiefelmeyer's was built in 1892 of wood. An addition was constructed in 1900, expanding the building to its current size. As other wood commercial buildings were destroyed by fire and replaced with brick structures, Stiefelmeyer's remains the only example of the once-dominant building material in Cullman's commercial district. The two-story building was designed in Italianate style. The building has a tall cornice with scroll-cut brackets and modillions. The front fa\u00e7ade features two sets of double-leaf doors, each flanked by large display windows resting on marble base panels. A shed roofed canopy, similar to the one installed around 1900, covers the sidewalk along the front. The first floor doors and windows are topped with prism glass transoms. Two further entrances are along the 2nd Street side, one in the middle, and a recessed entrance near the rear. Several one-over-one sash windows with small transoms also line the side of the building."
