  "/wiki/Adverse_effect": "An adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. An adverse effect may be termed a \"side effect\", when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect. If it results from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure, this is called a medical error and not a complication. Adverse effects are sometimes referred to as \"iatrogenic\" because they are generated by a physician/treatment. Some adverse effects occur only when starting, increasing or discontinuing a treatment.",
  "/wiki/Hypovolemia": "Hypovolemia, also known as volume depletion or volume contraction, is a state of decreased intravascular volume. This may be due to either a loss of both salt and water or a decrease in blood volume. Hypovolemia refers to the loss of extracellular fluid and should not be confused with dehydration. Dehydration refers to excessive total body water loss that results in cellular hypertonicity (a relatively substantial loss of fluid within individual cells).",
  "/wiki/Loop_diuretic": "Loop diuretics are diuretics that act at the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney. They are primarily used in medicine to treat hypertension and edema often due to congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease. While thiazide diuretics are more effective in patients with normal kidney function, loop diuretics are more effective in patients with impaired kidney function.",
  "/wiki/Thiazide": "Thiazide (/\u02c8\u03b8a\u026a\u0259za\u026ad/) refers to both a class of sulfur-containing organic molecules and a class of diuretics based on the chemical structure of benzothiadiazine. The thiazide drug class was discovered and developed at Merck and Co. in the 1950s. The first approved drug of this class, chlorothiazide, was marketed under the trade name Diuril beginning in 1958. In most countries, thiazides are the least expensive antihypertensive drugs available.",
  "/wiki/Lassitude": "Fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness. It may be sudden or gradual in onset. It is a normal phenomenon if it follows prolonged physical or mental activity, and resolves completely with rest. It may be a symptom of one of many medical conditions if it prolonged, severe, progressive, or occurs without provocation.",
  "/wiki/Thirst": "Thirst is the craving for potable fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink. It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance. It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites, such as sodium. If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst.",
  "/wiki/Muscle_cramps": "A cramp is a sudden, involuntary muscle contraction or overshortening; while generally temporary and non-damaging, they can cause significant pain and a paralysis-like immobility of the affected muscle. Onset is usually sudden and it resolves on its own over a period of several seconds, minutes, or hours. Cramps may occur in a skeletal muscle or smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle cramps may be caused by muscle fatigue or a lack of electrolytes such as sodium (a condition called hyponatremia), potassium (called hypokalemia), or magnesium (called magnesium deficiency). Cramps of smooth muscle may be due to menstruation or gastroenteritis.",
  "/wiki/Hypotension": "Hypotension is low blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood. Blood pressure is indicated by two numbers, the systolic blood pressure (the top number) and the diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number), which are the maximum and minimum blood pressures, respectively. A systolic blood pressure of less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic of less than 60\u00a0mm Hg is generally considered to be hypotension. Different numbers apply to children. However, in practice, blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present.",
  "/wiki/Hypokalemia": "Hypokalemia is a low level of potassium (K+) in the blood serum. Mild low potassium does not typically cause symptoms. Symptoms may include feeling tired, leg cramps, weakness, and constipation. Low potassium also increases the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, which is often too slow and can cause cardiac arrest.",

  "/wiki/Muscle_weakness": "Muscle weakness is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness.  True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years). The term myasthenia is from my- from Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03bf meaning \"muscle\" + -asthenia  \u1f00\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 meaning \"weakness\".",

  "/wiki/Metabolic_alkalosis": "Metabolic alkalosis is a metabolic condition in which the pH of tissue is elevated beyond the normal range (7.35\u20137.45). This is the result of decreased hydrogen ion concentration, leading to increased bicarbonate, or alternatively a direct result of increased bicarbonate concentrations. The condition typically cannot last long if the kidneys are functioning properly.",
  "/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis": "Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the body\u2019s acid-base balance. Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids. Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as an arterial blood pH lower than 7.37, which itself is a result of acidosis - the process in the body that causes a low pH in blood and tissues. Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive \u2013 pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low, normal, to high.",
  "/wiki/Kussmaul_respirations": "Kussmaul breathing is a deep and labored breathing pattern often associated with severe metabolic acidosis, particularly diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but also kidney failure.
