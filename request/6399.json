  "/wiki/Copa_MX": "The Copa MX (formerly called Copa Tower Monterrey , Copa Eliminatoria, Copa M\u00e9xico and Copa Corona MX (for sponsorship reasons)) is a Mexican football cup competition that was established in 1907. After a lengthy hiatus that began in 1997,[clarification needed] it was restored in 2012.\n On early editions of the cup, it consisted of both professional and amateur stages. It was the first official tournament that included teams from different parts of Mexico and was considered a prestigious tournament, especially during its earlier years of existence. The original purpose of the competition was to determine a national champion, thus distinguishing it from the local league championship. Its format was different from the local leagues as well, as it employed direct elimination and culminated in a final that received much more fanfare than the local leagues.\n The cup has twice been placed on hiatus by the Mexican Football Federation \u2013 between 1976 and 1988 and between 1992 and 1994 \u2013 with the 1997 edition of the tournament being the last time the Copa M\u00e9xico was held before it was placed on an indefinite hiatus. In May 2012, Liga MX president Decio de Mar\u00eda announced the return and rebranding of the tournament."
