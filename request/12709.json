  "/wiki/Kassler": "Kassler or Kasseler in German cuisine is the name given to a salted (cured) and slightly smoked cut of pork similar to British gammon. It can be either hot or cold smoked. Pork necks and loins are the most often used cuts although ribs, shoulders and bellies can also be used. It is often served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. In addition to pork, chicken prepared 'Kasseler' style is available at some butchers. It is unclear where the name comes from. It is often said, that the name derived from a Berlin-based butcher called Cassel who prepared the cut in the late 19th century. However, records of the town's inhabitants show that in the 19th century no butcher named Cassel or Kassel was living in Berlin.",

  "/wiki/Pickert": "A pickert is a flat, fried or baked potato dish from Westphalia, Germany. It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake. It comes as a round Pfannenpickert the size of a pan, a rectangular Kastenpickert, or a palm-sized regular Pickert. The name is derived from Low German picken, pecken (\"to stick something onto something else\"). The main ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10\u201315 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4\u20135 people. Pickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day's work in the fields.",
  "/wiki/Kohlwurst": "Kohlwurst, Lungenwurst or Lungwurst is a simple, fresh, strongly smoked sausage (Rohwurst) made of lights, pork and fat, which is mostly eaten cooked with kale (cabbage) dishes such as Knieperkohl. It is mainly used in Northeast and Northwest German and Silesian cuisine, as well as in southwestern parts of Denmark, where it is called \"k\u00e5lp\u00f8lse\" (kale sausage).\n To make Kohlwurst, pork (often the remains of the carcass) and fat are minced; then a similar amount of raw, cleaned lights is also minced. It is then all mixed together and, depending on the specific recipe, seasoned with onions, salt, pepper, marjoram, thyme, mustard seeds and allspice. Finally the sausage meat is loosely filled in casings of natural intestine and smoked for one to two weeks.\n Kohlwurst is not fried or boiled, but is gently poached with cooked vegetables.\n Comparable sausage types are Bregenwurst and Pinkel.",
  "/wiki/Westfalen": "Westphalia (/w\u025bst\u02c8fe\u026ali\u0259/; German: Westfalen [v\u025bst\u02c8fa\u02d0l\u0259n]; Low German: Westfalen [v\u03b5s(t)'f\u0254\u02d0ln]) is a region of northwestern Germany and one of the three historic parts of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It has an area of 20,210 km2 (7,803 sq mi) and 7.9 million inhabitants.\n The region is almost identical with the Province of Westphalia, which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1815 to 1918 and the Free State of Prussia from 1918 to 1946. In 1946, Westphalia merged with the Northern Rhineland, another former part of Prussia, to form the newly created state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1947, the state with its two historic parts was joined by a third one: Lippe, a former principality and free state.\n All of the seventeen districts and nine independent cities of Westphalia and Lippe's only district are members of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association (Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe).\n Previous to the formation of Westphalia as a province of Prussia and later state part of North Rhine-Westphalia, the term \"Westphalia\" was applied to different territories of different sizes such as a part of the ancient Duchy of Saxony, the Duchy of Westphalia or the Kingdom of Westphalia.  The Westphalian language, a variant of the German language, spreads beyond Westphalia's borders into southwestern Lower Saxony and northwestern Hesse.",

  "/wiki/Pumpernickel": "Pumpernickel (English:  /\u02c8p\u028cmp\u0259rn\u026ak\u0259l/; German: [\u02c8p\u028amp\u0250\u02ccn\u026akl\u0329]) is a typically heavy, slightly sweet rye bread traditionally made with sourdough starter and coarsely ground rye. It is often made today with a combination of rye flour and whole rye grains.\n At one time it was traditional peasant fare, but largely during the 20th century various forms became popular through delicatessens and supermarkets. Present-day European and North American pumpernickel differ in several characteristics, including the use of additional leaveners, and, in North America, coloring and flavoring agents, the addition of wheat flour, higher baking temperature, and a dramatically shortened baking time.",

  "/wiki/Stippgr\u00fctze": "Stippgr\u00fctze, also called Wurstebrei, is a German dish from Westphalia which is similar to  Gr\u00fctzwurst or Knipp. It consists of barley groats cooked in sausage juices (Wurstbr\u00fche), which are enriched with pieces of meat, offal, such as heart, kidney or liver and seasoned with spices and salt. More rarely, finely chopped onions are added. The cooked ingredients are minced after the juices have been poured off and a crumbly cake is left which is held together with fat and which sets on cooling. There are various recipes, but they all contain barley groats, fat and meat. A classic recipe contains pig offal or heart, belly pork with rind, lard greaves, barley groats, water, salt, pepper, allspice and thyme. The nutrition varies; one portion made from about 300 g of pork and 60 g of groats contains about 850 kJ. Its relatively high fat content means that Stippgr\u00fctze keeps well and is often preserved or frozen, so that it can be used over the winter.",
