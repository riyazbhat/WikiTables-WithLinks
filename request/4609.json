  "/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference": "The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference located in the eastern United States. Headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina, the conference consists of fifteen member universities, each of whom compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. Current members of the conference are Boston College, Clemson University, Duke University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Florida State University, North Carolina State University, Syracuse University, the University of Louisville, the University of Miami, the University of North Carolina, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and Wake Forest University.\n ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. Also, the conference enjoys extensive media coverage. The ACC was one of the five collegiate power conferences, which had automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC is one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to a New Year's Six bowl game, the successors to the BCS.\n The ACC was founded on May 8, 1953, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, with the University of Virginia joining in early December 1953 to bring the membership to eight. The loss of South Carolina in 1971 dropped membership to seven, while the addition of Georgia Tech in 1979 for non-football sports and 1983 for football brought it back to eight, and Florida State's arrival in 1991 for non-football sports and 1992 for football increased the membership to nine. Since 2000, with the widespread reorganization of the NCAA, seven additional schools have joined, and one original member (Maryland) has left to bring it to the current membership of 15 schools. The additions in recent years extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest.\n ACC member universities represent a range of well-regarded private and public universities of various enrollment sizes, all of which participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Consortium whose purpose is to \"enrich the educational missions, especially the undergraduate student experiences, of member universities\".",

The conference's members participated in 24 NCAA sports. The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history, while its shorter (1991 to 2013) football program, created by inviting one college and four other \"associate members\" (their football programs only) into the conference, resulted in two national championships.\n In basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships (UConn with three, Villanova, Georgetown, Syracuse, and Louisville with one each). Of the Big East's full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference, though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East. In 2011, the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying.\n In football, the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991, after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East, joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents (Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse) to form a new Division I football league. The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series, when that series was created in 1998. The Big East won two national football championships, both by University of Miami. Between 2005 and 2012, four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences, starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013.\n On July 1, 2013, the non-football playing schools (also known collectively as the secular Catholic 7) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name. The remaining six football-playing members, three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started, joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference (The American), which is the Big East's legal successor. The American retains the Big East's football structure and inherited its single automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series.

  "/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference": "The Big Ten Conference (stylized B1G, formerly the Western Conference and the Big Nine Conference) is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States.

They compete in the NCAA Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska, as well as two additional public land-grant schools and a private university.\n The Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when Purdue University president James H. Smart and representatives from the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin gathered at Chicago's Palmer House Hotel to set policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. In 1899, Indiana University and the University of Iowa joined the conference to increase the membership to nine schools. In 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the \"Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives\".  The conference is one of the nation's oldest, predating the founding of the NCAA by a decade, and was one of the first collegiate conferences to sponsor men's basketball.\n Big Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations. All institutions except full member University of Nebraska and associate member Notre Dame are members of the Association of American Universities. Large student enrollment is a hallmark of Big Ten Universities, as 12 of the 14 members feature enrollments of 30,000 or more students. Northwestern University, the only full member with a total enrollment of fewer than 30,000 students, is the lone private university among Big Ten membership (the University of Chicago, a private university, left the conference in 1946). Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni. Big Ten universities engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year. Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, an academic consortium. In 2014\u20132015, members generated more than $10 billion in research expenditures.\n Though the Big Ten existed for nearly a century as an assemblage of universities located primarily in the Midwest, the conference's geographic footprint now stretches east to the Atlantic Ocean. Despite the conference's name, the Big Ten has grown to fourteen members, with the following universities accepting invitations to join: Pennsylvania State University in 1990, the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln in 2011, and both the University of Maryland and Rutgers University in 2014.

Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.\n While the term was in use as early as 1933, it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division\u00a0I athletic conference in 1954. Seven of the eight schools were founded during the colonial period (Cornell was founded in 1865), and thus account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The other two colonial colleges, Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary, became public institutions instead.\n Ivy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious in the world, and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report.

Teams in the NEC compete in Division I for all sports except football, which competes in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), formerly Division I-AA. Participating schools are located principally in the Northeastern United States.\n The conference was named the ECAC Metro Conference when it was established in 1981. The original eleven member schools were Fairleigh Dickinson University, the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University (whose athletic program has now merged with that of LIU's Post campus into a single athletic program), Loyola College in Maryland (left in 1989), Marist College (left in 1997), Robert Morris University, St. Francis College (NY), Saint Francis College (PA), Siena College (left in 1984), Towson State University (left in 1982), the University of Baltimore (left in 1983) and Wagner College.\n The conference's name was changed to its present form on August 1, 1988. Other names considered were Big North, Great North, North Shore, Northern, Northeastern, Eastern and Eastern Private Intercollegiate.\n The Northeast Conference has expanded eight times since 1981. The expansions and additions from the original charter members were in 1985 (Monmouth University, which left in 2013), 1989 (Mount St. Mary's University), 1992 (Rider University, which left in 1997), 1997 (Central Connecticut State University), 1998 (Quinnipiac University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County which respectively left in 2013 and 2003), 1999 (Sacred Heart University), 2008 (Bryant University), and 2019 (Merrimack College). The Northeast Conference's rank was largest at 12 in 2008 with the addition of Bryant University; it dropped to 10 in 2013 with the departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac for the MAAC, and returned to 11 with the 2019 addition of Merrimack.\n The most recent changes were announced in 2018 and took effect with the 2019\u201320 school year. First, on September 10, the NEC announced it would add Merrimack. Then, on October 3, Long Island University announced that it would combine its two existing athletic programs\u2014NEC member LIU Brooklyn and the Division II program at LIU Post\u2014into a single Division I program under the LIU name. The new LIU program, nicknamed Sharks, maintains LIU Brooklyn's previous memberships in Division I and the NEC.\n The Northeast Conference has a total of 10 full members in 23 championship sports: baseball, men's and women's basketball, women's bowling, men's and women's cross country, women's field hockey, football, men's and women's golf, men's and women's indoor track & field, women's lacrosse, men's and women's outdoor track & field, men's and women's soccer, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, and women's volleyball.\n Men's lacrosse became the league's 23rd sport for the 2011 season. The number of sports dropped to 22 after the 2012\u201313 school year, when the conference dropped field hockey. The departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac to become all-sports members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) in July 2013 gave the MAAC four full members that sponsored the sport; the other two were NEC single-sport affiliates Rider and Siena. The MAAC then decided to add field hockey as a sponsored sport for the 2013 season, and all of the NEC's remaining field hockey programs eventually joined the MAAC except for Saint Francis (PA), which joined the Atlantic 10 Conference. The NEC reinstated field hockey as a sponsored sport for the 2019 season with seven members\u2014full members Bryant, LIU, Merrimack, Sacred Heart, and Wagner, plus associate members Fairfield and Rider.\n There are four other affiliate members which compete in football, men's lacrosse, and women's bowling.",

  "/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Tournament": "The 2007 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament was held from June 1 to 24, 2007. Sixty-four NCAA Division I college baseball teams  advanced to the post season tournament after having played through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament.\n The 2007 tournament culminated with 8 teams advancing to the College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, on June 15. Unseeded Oregon State repeated as national champions, winning all five of its games in the 2007 CWS.\n Oregon State went undefeated through the College World Series, posting a 5-0 record. The Beavers, led by head coach Pat Casey, won all three games in their four-team bracket and then defeated North Carolina in two games in the best-of-three championship series.  Oregon State became the fifth team to win consecutive NCAA titles (last done by LSU in 1996-97), and were the first team to win four games in a CWS by six or more runs.  As of 2019, 2007 Oregon State remains the only team to have ever won at least four games by six or more runs in the same College World Series.  Their opener against Cal State Fullerton was a tight 3-2 victory, but OSU's last four games in the CWS were not close, impressive for a team seeded in the lower half of the 64-team tournament.\n The Beavers also became the first team to win the CWS after having posted a losing conference record.  Oregon State was a disappointing 10-14 (.417) in the Pac-10, placing sixth among the nine baseball-playing schools (Oregon dropped baseball in 1981, but revived it in 2009.)\n However, the Beavers' non-conference record during the regular season was an impressive 28-3 (.903), and as defending NCAA champions, just enough to gain a berth in the 64-team tournament.  They were placed as a No.\u00a03 seed in one of the 16 four-team regionals, in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Oregon State responded by going 11-1 (.917) in the post season. Oregon State won their final 10 games to finish at 49-18 (.731) overall.  The Beavers trailed in only one inning of 2007 CWS: the first inning of the final game.  Their only loss in the post season came during the second game of regionals, where they fell in 13 innings to host Virginia.\n Oregon State freshman pitcher Jorge Reyes (of Warden, Washington) was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2007 CWS.  Reyes was 2-0 as a starter, defeating Cal State Fullerton in the opener and North Carolina in the first game of the finals.\n Two elite programs from Louisiana, LSU and Tulane both failed to qualify for the field of 64, marking the first time since 1984 both schools stayed home. LSU reached the College World Series 13 times between 1986 and 2004, winning five national championships (1991, 1993, 1996, 1997, 2000), while Tulane made trips to the CWS in 2001 and 2005."
