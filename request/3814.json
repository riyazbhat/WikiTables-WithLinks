  "/wiki/Araluen,_New_South_Wales": "Araluen is a small town near Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, in Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council.

At the 2016 census, Araluen had a population of 168 people.\n The name 'Araluen' meant 'water lily' or 'place of the water lilies' in the local Aboriginal language. At the time of European settlement Araluen was described as a broad alluvial valley with many natural billabongs covered with water lilies. Unfortunately, no such billabongs exist in the Araluen valley today. As with most river and creek valleys in south-eastern Australia, the natural landscape of Araluen Creek and its valley were destroyed by rampant and extremely destructive gold mining during the 'gold rush' in the latter half of the 19th century. The town experienced a decline after a flash flood in 1860 virtually destroyed the town, killing 24 people.\n A second flash flood came in March, 2012 killing one person.\n Araluen experienced a great population increase during the gold rush. It had various schools between 1867 and 1956. Araluen West Public School operated from 1867 to 1919, although it was called Bourketown Public School during its first two years.
