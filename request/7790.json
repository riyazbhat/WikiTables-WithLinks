  "/wiki/Hare_Force": "Hare Force is a 1944 Warner Bros. cartoon in the Merrie Melodies series, directed by Friz Freleng and starring Bugs Bunny and an old lady. Although the title is an obvious play on Air Force, the cartoon's plot has nothing to do with the military. As Time Goes By is sung in this short by Sylvester the dog (not to be confused with Sylvester the cat) and Bugs at different points. This cartoon is also the first short that uses the refined design of Bugs Bunny outside of a Bob Clampett directed cartoon, though it was slightly tweaked by Freleng in this short.",
  "/wiki/Willoughby_the_Dog": "Willoughby is a minor animated cartoon fictional character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series of cartoons. He is a hound dog who is characterized by his below-average intelligence and overall gullibility. Willoughby first appeared in the 1940 cartoon Of Fox and Hounds. He was created and voiced by Tex Avery. According to Chuck Jones, the character was based on Lennie, from Of Mice and Men (of which the title of Of Fox and Hounds is a knockoff). [citation needed] Critic Steven Hartley described this short as lacking in creativity, originality, excitement, and story construction, particularly compared to Avery's seminal earlier work A Wild Hare. Willoughby later appears in other Warner Brothers animated shorts, including The Heckling Hare (1941), The Crackpot Quail (1941), and Nutty News (1942), as the lead dog of a fox hunting party. A fundamentally similar character, Laramore, appears in To Duck or Not to Duck (1943), albeit with a fully brown coat of fur. Willoughby's brief career was essentially over before the end of World War II.",
  "/wiki/Friz_Freleng": "Isadore Friz Freleng (August 21, 1906 - May 26, 1995), often credited as I. Freleng, was an American animator, cartoonist, director, producer, and composer known for his work at Warner Bros. Cartoons on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He introduced and/or developed several of the studio's biggest stars, including Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Tweety, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam (to whom he was said to bear more than a passing resemblance), and Speedy Gonzales. The senior director at Warners' Termite Terrace studio, Freleng directed more cartoons than any other director in the studio (a total of 266), and is also the most honored of the Warner directors, having won five Academy Awards and three Emmy Awards[disputed - discuss]. After Warners closed down the animation studio in 1963, Freleng and business partner David H. DePatie founded DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which produced cartoons (including The Pink Panther Show), feature film title sequences, and Saturday-morning cartoons through the early 1980s. The nickname Friz came from his friend, Hugh Harman, who initially nicknamed him Congressman Frizby after a fictional senator who appeared in satirical pieces in the Los Angeles Examiner. Over time, this shortened to Friz.",
  "/wiki/Hare_Remover": "Hare Remover is a Merrie Melodies cartoon starring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, released in 1946. The film was the second Bugs Bunny cartoon to be directed by Frank Tashlin at Warner Bros., the first being The Unruly Hare (1945). The title is another obvious play on hair, and on patent medicines that had the opposite effect of a hair tonic (as with another Bugs title, Hare Tonic). This short is the last short Frank Tashlin directed before leaving Warner Bros. to direct live-action films. His animation unit was handed over to Robert McKimson after he left the studio.",
  "/wiki/Elmer_Fudd": "Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series, and an adversary of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself). His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit. Elmer's signature catchphrase is, Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits, as well as his trademark laughter. The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones' work What's Opera, Doc? (one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs, though he felt bad about it), the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville, and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts (Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) with Fudd, Bugs Bunny, and Daffy Duck. An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer's aspects before the character's more conspicuous features were set.",
  "/wiki/Frank_Tashlin": "Francis Fredrick von Taschlein (February 19, 1913 - May 5, 1972), better known by his stage name Frank Tashlin, was an American animator, cartoonist, children's writer, illustrator, screenwriter, and film director of comedy movies. He was also known as Tish Tash and Frank Tash.",
  "/wiki/Hare_Tonic": "Hare Tonic is a 1945 Warner Bros. cartoon in the Looney Tunes series, directed by Chuck Jones and written by Tedd Pierce. It stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, making this the second cartoon directed by Jones to co-star the two (the first being Elmer's Pet Rabbit). Voice characterizations are by Mel Blanc and (uncredited) Arthur Q. Bryan, respectively. The title is a play on hair tonic, a type of patent medicine, reinforced by Bugs' portrayal of a fake doctor at a few points in the picture. A bottle of hare tonic appeared as a prop in a 1946 cartoon, The Big Snooze.",
  "/wiki/Chuck_Jones": "Charles Martin Jones (September 21, 1912 - February 22, 2002) was an American animated filmmaker and cartoonist, best known for his work with Warner Bros. Cartoons on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts. He wrote, produced, and/or directed many classic animated cartoon shorts starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew, Porky Pig, Michigan J. Frog, the Three Bears, and a slew of other Warner characters. After his career at Warner Bros. ended in 1962, Jones started Sib Tower 12 Productions, and began producing cartoons for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, including a new series of Tom and Jerry shorts and the television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. He later started his own studio, Chuck Jones Enterprises, which created several one-shot specials, and periodically worked on Looney Tunes related works. Jones was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning three times. He won for the cartoons For Scent-imental Reasons, So Much for So Little, and The Dot and the Line. Robin Williams presented Jones with an Honorary Academy Award in 1996 for his iconic work in the animation industry. Film historian Leonard Maltin has praised Jones' work at Warner Bros., MGM and Chuck Jones Enterprises. He also said that the feud that there may have been between Jones and colleague Bob Clampett was mainly because they were so different from each other. In Jerry Beck's The 50 Greatest Cartoons, ten of the entries were directed by Jones, with four out of the five top cartoons (including first place) being Jones shorts.",
  "/wiki/A_Hare_Grows_in_Manhattan": "A Hare Grows In Manhattan is a Warner Bros. cartoon in the Merrie Melodies series, released on March 22, 1947:429 and directed by Friz Freleng. It stars Bugs Bunny and a pack of dogs (the leader being a bulldog who resembles Hector). Unlike many cases where hare is a pun on hair, the title here is a pun on a then-recent book which figures into the climax of the cartoon (however, it does also contain a punning reference to what hair does: grow).",
  "/wiki/Hector_the_Bulldog": "Hector the Bulldog is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. Hector is a muscle-bound bulldog with gray fur (except in A Street Cat Named Sylvester and Greedy for Tweety, where his fur is yellowish) and walks pigeon-toed. His face bears a perpetual scowl between two immense jowls. He usually wears a black collar with silver studs.",
  "/wiki/Easter_Yeggs": "Easter Yeggs is a Looney Tunes animated short originally released theatrically on June 28, 1947, featuring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The title is a play on Easter eggs and on yegg, a slang term for a burglar or safecracker.",

  "/wiki/The_Wabbit_Who_Came_to_Supper": "The Wabbit Who Came to Supper is a 1942 American Warner Brothers Merrie Melodies cartoon featuring early appearances by Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The Elmer character is in a transitional state from his earliest appearances in Bob Clampett's shorts and the appearance which he adopted around 1943. This short is one of several pre-August 1948 WB cartoon shorts that lapsed into the public domain due to United Artists failing to renew the copyright in time. The title of the short is a reference to the 1942 Warner Brothers film version of the 1939 George S. Kaufman Broadway comedy The Man Who Came to Dinner, in which an overbearing house-guest threatens to take over the lives of a small-town family.",
  "/wiki/Bowery_Bugs": "Bowery Bugs is a Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Arthur Davis \n, written by Lloyd Turner and Bill Scott, and released in mid-1949 as part of the Merrie Melodies series.

  "/wiki/Case_of_the_Missing_Hare": "Case of the Missing Hare is a 1942 Warner Bros. cartoon in the Merrie Melodies series, directed by Chuck Jones and starring Bugs Bunny. The title is a typical play on words, and although it suggests a mystery story, it bears no apparent relationship to the plot line. This is one of the few cartoons where Bugs Bunny does not say his catchphrase, Eh, what's up, Doc?, as well as being one of few cartoons in the character's filmography to fall into the public domain, due to the failure of the last copyright holder, United Artists Television, to renew the original copyright within the allotted 28-year period.",
  "/wiki/Acrobatty_Bunny": "Acrobatty Bunny is a Warner Bros. cartoon released in 1946 as part of the Looney Tunes series, directed by Robert McKimson (his second), and starring Bugs Bunny and Nero the Lion.",
  "/wiki/Wackiki_Wabbit": "Wackiki Wabbit is a 1943 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon, starring Bugs Bunny. It was written by Tedd Pierce and directed by Chuck Jones. Voices were provided by Mel Blanc (Bugs), Tedd Pierce (the tall, thin man), and Michael Maltese (the short, fat man - the two men's appearances are rough caricatures of the actual men). The musical score was conducted by Carl Stalling. Wackiki Wabbit contains an experimental use of strongly graphic, nearly abstract backgrounds. The title is a double play on words, with Wackiki suggesting both the island setting (as in Waikiki) as well as suggesting wacky (crazy) along with the usual Elmer Fudd speech pronunciation of rabbit, although Elmer does not appear in this picture.",
  "/wiki/Hare_Do": "Hare Do is a 1949 Merrie Melodies Cartoon starring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd which was released in 1949. It is one of the few Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd pairings directed by Friz Freleng that was released after Hare Trigger, the debut of Yosemite Sam (most of whose appearances were in cartoons directed by Freleng). The title of the cartoon is an obvious pun on the term hairdo, another word for a hairstyle. This is also the last cartoon where Bugs is seen sitting on The Warner Bros. Shield and then he pulls it down during the post-1948 period. This would not occur again until (Blooper) Bunny in 1991. The cartoon's final scene is a nod to the ending of 1939's A Day at the Zoo, which featured Elmer's prototype Egghead being swallowed up by a lion.",
  "/wiki/Rebel_Rabbit": "Rebel Rabbit is a 1949 animated short starring Bugs Bunny. It is an anomaly in the Bugs Bunny cartoons - in this one, Bugs is the aggressor having found out that the bounty for rabbits is only two cents and intends to prove that rabbits are tough - even if he has to be more obnoxious than anybody. He also, in a rarity, receives a comeuppance (despite achieving his goal), something only Cecil Turtle had ever done to Bugs up to this point. Some scenes utilize live action stock footage.",
  "/wiki/Hillbilly_Hare": "Hillbilly Hare is a 1949 produced, 1950 released Merrie Melodies cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny, produced and released by Warner Bros. Pictures.

  "/wiki/Duck!_Rabbit,_Duck!": "Duck! Rabbit, Duck! is a 1953 Merrie Melodies comedy cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones, and starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. It is the sequel to Rabbit Seasoning, and the third (along with Rabbit Fire) and final entry in Jones' hunting trilogy (the only major difference in format between this film and the others is that it takes place during the middle of winter). Produced by Eddie Selzer for Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc., the short was released to theaters in 1953 by Warner Bros. Pictures. This is the only film in the trilogy where Bugs does not crossdress.",
  "/wiki/Daffy_Duck": "Daffy Duck is an animated cartoon character produced by Warner Bros. Styled as an anthropomorphic black duck, the character has appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, in which he usually has been depicted as a foil for Bugs Bunny. Daffy was one of the first of the new screwball characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier during the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye. Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 167 appearances and Porky Pig's 162 appearances. Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character. Directors such as Bob Clampett, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones are notable examples of the character. Daffy was number 14 on TV Guide's list of top 50 greatest cartoon characters."
