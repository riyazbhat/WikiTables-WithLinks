The piggy bank is known to collectors as a \"still bank\" as opposed to the \"mechanical banks\" popular in the early 20th century.

Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles.\n He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, \"Th-th-th-that's all folks!\" This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. In contrast, the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan: So Long, Folks! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series (when Bugs Bunny was the closing character, he would break the pattern by simply saying, in his Brooklynese accent, \"And Dat's De End!\"). He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character.\n Porky's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, \"What's going on?\" might become \"What's guh-guh-guh-guh\u2014...what's happening?\" Porky's age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in Porky's Preview), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years. In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons, Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head, and his attempt to close the show with \"The End\" becomes \"Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks!\" Porky Pig would appear in 153 cartoons in the Golden age of American animation.",
