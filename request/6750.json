It is likely that they were used only as tombs in the beginning, and were later used as cenotaphs. The dead are mostly from the samurai class, but the names of priests and artisans have also been found. These tombs are extremely numerous in the hills surrounding Kamakura, and estimates of their number range from 1,500 to over 5,000. The total number will remain unknown, as many have been destroyed and others may not yet have been found.\nYagura can be found either isolated, as in the case of the Harakiri Yagura, or in clusters of almost 200 caves. Groups of yagura are labeled with the suffix -gun (\u7fa4, group). The most conveniently seen yagura for most tourists are those at Jufuku-ji, near Kamakura station. Its cemetery has many yagura, including those with the cenotaphs of H\u014dj\u014d Masako and Minamoto no Sanetomo.\n True yagura can be found also in the Miura Peninsula, in the Izu Peninsula, and as far away as Awa Province (Chiba).",
  "/wiki/T\u014d": "Pagodas in Japan are called t\u014d (\u5854, lit. pagoda), sometimes butt\u014d (\u4ecf\u5854, lit. Buddhist pagoda) or t\u014dba (\u5854\u5a46, lit. pagoda) and historically derive from the Chinese pagoda, itself an interpretation of the Indian stupa.  Like the stupa, pagodas were originally used as reliquaries but in many cases they ended up losing this function. Pagodas are quintessentially Buddhist and an important component of Japanese Buddhist temple compounds but, because until the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, a Shinto shrine was normally also a Buddhist temple and vice versa, they are not rare at shrines either. The famous Itsukushima Shrine, for example, has one.\n After the Meiji Restoration the word t\u014d, once used exclusively in a religious context, came to mean also \"tower\" in the western sense, as for example in Eiffel tower (\u30a8\u30c3\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u5854, Efferu-t\u014d).\n Of the Japanese pagoda's many forms, some are built in wood and are collectively known as mokut\u014d (\u6728\u5854, lit. wood pagoda), but most are carved out of stone (sekit\u014d (\u77f3\u5854, lit. stone pagoda). Wood pagodas are large buildings with either two stories (like the tah\u014dt\u014d (\u591a\u5b9d\u5854, lit. Tah\u014d pagoda), see photo below) or an odd number of stories. Extant wood pagodas with more than two storeys have almost always either three stories (and are therefore called sanj\u016b-no-t\u014d (\u4e09\u91cd\u5854, lit. three-storeyed pagoda)) or five (and are called goj\u016b-no-t\u014d (\u4e94\u91cd\u5854, lit. five-storeyed pagoda). Stone pagodas are nearly always small, usually well below 3 metres, and as a rule offer no usable space. If they have more than one storey, pagodas are called tas\u014dt\u014d (\u591a\u5c64\u5854, lit. multi-storied pagoda) or taj\u016bt\u014d (\u591a\u91cd\u5854, lit. multi-storied pagoda).\n A pagoda's size is measured in ken, where a ken is the interval between two pillars of a traditional-style building. A  tah\u014dt\u014d for example can be either 5x5 ken or 3x3 ken. The word is usually translated in English as \"bay\" and is better understood as an indication of proportions than as a unit of measurement.",
