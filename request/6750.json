It is likely that they were used only as tombs in the beginning, and were later used as cenotaphs. The dead are mostly from the samurai class, but the names of priests and artisans have also been found. These tombs are extremely numerous in the hills surrounding Kamakura, and estimates of their number range from 1,500 to over 5,000. The total number will remain unknown, as many have been destroyed and others may not yet have been found. Yagura can be found either isolated, as in the case of the Harakiri Yagura, or in clusters of almost 200 caves. Groups of yagura are labeled with the suffix -gun (\u7fa4, group).",
  "/wiki/T\u014d": "Pagodas in Japan are called t\u014d (\u5854, lit. pagoda), sometimes butt\u014d (\u4ecf\u5854, lit. Buddhist pagoda) or t\u014dba (\u5854\u5a46, lit. pagoda) and historically derive from the Chinese pagoda, itself an interpretation of the Indian stupa. Like the stupa, pagodas were originally used as reliquaries but in many cases they ended up losing this function. Pagodas are quintessentially Buddhist and an important component of Japanese Buddhist temple compounds but, because until the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, a Shinto shrine was normally also a Buddhist temple and vice versa, they are not rare at shrines either. The famous Itsukushima Shrine, for example, has one. After the Meiji Restoration the word t\u014d, once used exclusively in a religious context, came to mean also \"tower\" in the western sense, as for example in Eiffel tower (\u30a8\u30c3\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u5854, Efferu-t\u014d).",
