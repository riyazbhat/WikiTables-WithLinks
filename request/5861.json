  "/wiki/El_Pez_que_Fuma": "El Pez que Fuma (English: The Smoking Fish) is a 1977 Venezuelan film directed by Rom\u00e1n Chalbaud. The film takes place in La Guaira, in the titular brothel. It is considered by many to represent a high point in Venezuelan cinema, and was made during the Golden Age of Venezuelan cinema. The story reflects the social reality of Venezuela; it features the poverty and crime but does not make them the centre of the story. It also uses its score as symbolism, something considered novel. Chalbaud describes it as a very character-driven film, and it is structured as a traditional melodrama. In 2016, the film was screened for its 40th Anniversary at Cinemateca Nacional de Venezuela del Museo de Bellas Artes.",
