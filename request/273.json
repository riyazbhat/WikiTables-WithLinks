The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their \"especially high historical or artistic value\". The list presents 56 entries from the 7th century Tang Dynasty to the Kamakura period with more than half originating in China.

The list contains works that have been originally compiled in China by Chinese authors. A large proportion of these works are Chinese classics."
