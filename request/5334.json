  "/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry:_The_Movie": "Tom and Jerry: The Movie is a 1992 American/German animated musical film featuring the characters Tom and Jerry. Produced and directed by Phil Roman, the film stars the voices of Richard Kind, Dana Hill (in her final film role), Anndi McAfee, Tony Jay, Rip Taylor, Henry Gibson, Michael Bell, Ed Gilbert, David L. Lander, Howard Morris and Charlotte Rae.\n Produced by Turner Pictures and Roman's Film Roman, it is the first theatrical feature-length animated film featuring the cat-and-mouse pair as well as their return to the big screen after 25 years. Although largely mute in the original cartoons, the duo talked extensively in this film. Joseph Barbera, co-founder of Hanna-Barbera Productions and co-creator of Tom and Jerry, served as creative consultant for the film.\n The film tells the story about Tom and Jerry, who become homeless after their home is wrecked, and meet and help a little girl escape from her child-hating and abusive guardian in order to find her lost and presumed-dead father. After having its world premiere in Germany on October 1, 1992, Tom and Jerry: The Movie was released theatrically by Miramax Films, a subsidiary of Disney at the time, and LIVE Entertainment on July 30, 1993 in the United States.\n The film received predominantly negative reviews from fans and film critics for the film's use of dialogue for the characters, musical numbers, sub-par voice acting, dark content, lack of focus on the title characters and slapstick and the antagonist's similarities to Ursula the Sea Witch and Madame Medusa, the villains from Disney's animated films The Little Mermaid (1989), and The Rescuers (1977), respectively, although the animation was praised. The film was also a box office bomb, earning only $3.6 million on a $3.5 million budget.",

  "/wiki/The_Thief_and_the_Cobbler": "The Thief and the Cobbler is an animated fantasy film directed by Canadian-British animator Richard Williams. Originally conceived in the 1960s, the film was in and out of production for nearly three decades due to independent funding and ambitiously complex animation. It was finally placed into full production in 1989 when Warner Bros. agreed to finance and distribute the film. When production went over budget and fell behind schedule, the film was heavily cut and re-edited by producer Fred Calvert without Williams' involvement; it was eventually released in 1993 by Allied Filmmakers under the title The Princess and the Cobbler. Two years later, Miramax Films released another re-edit entitled Arabian Knight. Both versions of the film performed poorly and received mixed reviews.\n Over the years, various people and companies, including The Walt Disney Company's Roy E. Disney, have discussed restoring the film to its original version. In 2013, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences archived Richard Williams' own 35mm workprint. Williams himself acknowledged the film's rehabilitated reputation, thanks to projects like the popular fan edit, The Recobbled Cut, and Persistence of Vision, a 2012 documentary of the film's production.\n With The Thief and the Cobbler being in and out of production from 1964 until 1995, a total of 31 years, it surpasses the 20-year Guinness record previously held by Tiefland (1954). It was also the final film for several actors and artists, including animators Ken Harris (died 1982); Grim Natwick (died 1990); and Art Babbit (died 1992), as well as actors Felix Aylmer (died 1979); Kenneth Williams (died 1988); Sir Anthony Quayle (died 1989); and Vincent Price (died 1993, a month after the film's initial release).",

Set in a universe filled with bio-mechanical beings allied with classical element-themed tribes, the story follows two friends from the fire-based village of Ta-Koro on a quest to find the owner of the Mask of Light, a mystical artifact that can potentially defeat Makuta, an evil entity threatening the island. The story is based on the latter half of the toyline's 2003 narrative.\n The project was first proposed in 2001, during the original run of the Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A major part of the graphical design was adjusting the characters so they could work in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework was done with the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.\n Multiple studios were involved in the development and distribution of Mask of Light: it was co-produced by Lego and Create TV & Film, developed by Creative Capers Entertainment and CGCG, and post-production was handled 310 Studios and Hacienda Post.
