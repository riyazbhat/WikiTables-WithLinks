  "/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio": "Cincinnati (/\u02ccs\u026ans\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6ti/ SIN-sih-NAT-ee) is a major city in the U.S. state of Ohio, and is the government seat of Hamilton County. Settled in 1788, the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers, the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky. The city is the economic and cultural hub of the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the fastest growing economic power in the Midwestern United States based on increase of economic output, which had a population of 2,190,209 as of the 2018 census estimates. This makes it Ohio's largest metropolitan area and the nation's 29th-largest. With a city population estimated at 302,605, Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and 65th in the United States. Cincinnati is also within a day's drive of 49.70% of the United States populace, the most of any  city in the United States.\n In the 19th century, Cincinnati was an American boomtown in the middle of the country. Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by New Orleans and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the sixth-biggest city for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the American Revolution, as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n Cincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly Chicago, which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and St. Louis, which for decades after the Civil War served as the gateway to westward migration.\n Cincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball; the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League; and  FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer.  The city's largest institution of higher education, the University of Cincinnati, was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States. Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years. In the late 1800s, Cincinnati was commonly referred to as the \"Paris of America\", due mainly to such ambitious architectural projects as the Music Hall, Cincinnatian Hotel, and Shillito Department Store. Cincinnati is the birthplace of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States.",

Iliff, the church features a two-story rectangular floor plan with a prominent central bell tower.  Among its other distinctive architectural elements are the rose windows in the main gable, pairs of windows on its second floor, and the symmetry evidenced in the overall design of the building.\n Although Cincinnati was largely Presbyterian in its early history, Mount Adams was originally a strongly Catholic community; Pilgrim Presbyterian was the first Protestant church of any denomination to be founded in that neighborhood.  Today, the congregation is no longer in existence: the building is now owned by Pilgrim Chapel United Church of Christ, and its name is absent from the roster of the Cincinnati Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church.\n In 1980, the former Pilgrim Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It became a manufacturing center due to its location on both the river and the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy relies on diversified sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, biomedicals, and higher education.\n The city's major cultural institutions include the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

  "/wiki/North_Presbyterian_Church_(Cleveland,_Ohio)": "North Presbyterian Church is a historic Presbyterian church on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio, United States.  Constructed in the 1880s, the church building has been named a historic site.\n Throughout its history, the congregation has been focused on Sunday school work.  North Presbyterian Church developed out of a mission Sunday school established in east-side Cleveland in 1859.  The local presbytery organized a congregation out of the Sunday school in 1867, and within a short while, the new congregation formed the first of two mission Sunday schools in other locations.  When the present building was constructed, it was designed to facilitate Sunday schools, with small classrooms surrounding the sanctuary.\n Members arranged for the present building to be erected in the mid-1880s: construction began in 1886 and continued into the following year.  It is an eclectic structure, mixing Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival design elements in an unusual manner.  A central tower protrudes slightly from the rest of the facade; it is topped by a steep pyramidal roof.  At the base of the tower is the main entrance, and small vertical windows shelter a belfry immediately below the base of the roof; a large window fills nearly all of the space between the main entrance and the belfry.  On each side of the tower, the facade is divided into four bays by buttresses running from foundation to the roof, topped by steep pinnacles.  Each bay includes two small windows at ground level and a massive window, similar to the one in the tower, that fills most of the width and height in the bay.  The building's main corner (on the left from the perspective of someone facing the main entrance), facing an intersection along Superior Avenue, is rounded, and the design of the facade continues onto the western side.\n In late 1974, North Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in local history.  Critical to this designation was the congregation's dedication to religious education, as seen both in its history and its architecture.  The general design elements were unusual for period churches, and the floor plan that concentrated on the Sunday school space was highly distinctive; together, these themes caused the church to be a unique example of late nineteenth-century churches in the region.",

This makes Columbus the second-most populous city in the Midwest (after Chicago, Illinois). It is the core city of the Columbus, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses ten counties. With a population of 2,078,725, it is Ohio's second-largest metropolitan area.\n Columbus is the county seat of Franklin County. The municipality has also annexed portions of adjoining Delaware and Fairfield counties.

  "/wiki/Welsh_Presbyterian_Church_(Columbus,_Ohio)": "The Welsh Presbyterian Church is a historic former church in downtown Columbus, Ohio, United States.  Used as a church only for a few decades, the building has seen many uses over the ensuing decades, ranging from commercial to government-affiliated to social services.  Because of its architecture, the building has been named a historic site.\n Founded in 1849, the Welsh Presbyterian Church first worshipped one block away from its second location.  Work began on the second church building in 1887 and was finished in the following year.  This building, in turn, closed in 1919 after the congregation moved farther away, and for many years the property was employed for commercial purposes.  Among its tenants since that time have been the offices of Commercial Motor Freight, a factory, a store of the M.C. Lilley Company, and the offices of the Community Action Organization for the Columbus metropolitan area.\n Built of brick, the Romanesque Revival building rests on a foundation of limestone, is covered with a slate roof, and features elements of sandstone.  Two entrances are placed on the front of the building: one at the far left, and one at the far right, with large windows between them.  The roof is steeply gabled, with an oculus near the peak on the front gable, while the single-story side walls feature both small and large windows at various heights.  Cylindrical components are placed at the corners as well as occasional points on the facade.  These elements combine to produce somewhat of the appearance of a fortress with turrets and buttresses.\n In 1980, the Welsh Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its architecture.  Its significance derives partly from its location, as almost no 19th-century structures have survived in its immediate vicinity, and comparable examples of Romanesque Revival architecture are rare in downtown Columbus.  The building is now home to Faith Mission, a homeless shelter affiliated with Lutheran Social Services.",

  "/wiki/Independence_Presbyterian_Church": "Independence Presbyterian Church is a historic church in the city of Independence, Ohio, United States.  Constructed in the 1850s, the stone church building was originally home to a congregation heavily dependent on the local mining economy, but since the 1920s it has again been associated with an active congregation.  It was named a historic site in the 1970s.\n Independence Presbyterian is largely a stone building; both the foundation and the walls are stone, and the roof is slate.  The structure is that of a gabled rectangle with a square tower at the front, in which is placed the main entrance.  The top of the tower includes a belfry with louvering.  The overall design is simple with comparatively little ornamentation, although a significant counterexample is the building's back wall, in which was placed a prominent petroglyph known as the Independence Slab.\n Local Presbyterians were organized into a congregation in 1837, but nearly two decades passed before the building was built; it was constructed in 1855 according to a design produced by Jacob Merkle.  The local economy at the time was heavily dependent on nearby stone quarries, and the congregation was no different: when the quarries closed in 1905, the congregation was also disorganized.  After twenty years of vacancy, the building became home to another Presbyterian congregation in 1925.  Growth forced the building's replacement in the 1960s, and a new structure was finished on an adjacent property in 1963.  Since that time, the old building has generally been used only for special events.  The congregation remains an active part of the Western Reserve Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church (USA).\n In 1977, the old church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.
