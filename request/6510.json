  "/wiki/Hertz": "The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second. It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples: kilohertz (103 Hz, kHz), megahertz (106 Hz, MHz), gigahertz (109 Hz, GHz), terahertz (1012 Hz, THz), petahertz (1015 Hz, PHz),  exahertz (1018 Hz, EHz),\nand zettahertz (1021 Hz, ZHz). Some of the unit's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones, particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications. It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven. The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy, via the photon energy equation (E=h\u03bd), with one hertz equivalent to h joules.",

There is no channel, past or present, named ITV Wales and West.

Today, those services are known as ITV Cymru Wales and ITV West Country (since ITV West and ITV Westcountry merged into a single region). They are provided by ITV plc which owns and operates the two services through its subsidiary ITV Broadcasting Ltd.\n From January 2014, the dual-region licence was split in two, with ITV Cymru Wales for Wales and ITV West Country covering the West of England. Both licences remain held by ITV Broadcasting Ltd and the legal names of the former HTV companies have not yet been changed again.
