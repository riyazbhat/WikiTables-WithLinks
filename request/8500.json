  "/wiki/Denver_and_Rio_Grande_Western_Railroad_Locomotive_No._315": "Denver and Rio Grande Western No. 315 is a Class C-18 2-8-0 Consolidation type, narrow gauge steam railway locomotive that was originally built for the Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1868. On the F&CC it was number 3, named Elkton.  After the demise of the F&CC in 1915, the locomotive sat unused until the Denver and Rio Grande purchased it and four of its sisters in 1917 to help with war traffic. In D&RG service it became No. 425, but was renumbered No. 315 when the D&RG became the Denver and Rio Grande Western in the reorganization of 1924. It began its D&RG service at Alamosa, Colorado, was leased to the Rio Grande Southern for 1926-27 and then spent most of the next decade on the Gunnison Division, in Salida, Colorado, on the line to Montrose and on the branch to Ouray.\n As larger locomotives, notably the K-27 K-36 and K-37 Mikados came on line, smaller engines like 315 were used as switchers or scrapped.  No. 315 spent several periods in the shops in the early 1940s, notably with a broken main rod and then later for flue work and to replace its pilot with a switch engine pilot. It appeared in the movie Colorado Territory in 1948, but was finally taken out of service in 1949. It returned to the silver screen in Around the World in 80 Days in 1956, but was no longer in operating condition, so it was pushed by a diesel locomotive disguised as a baggage car.\n It was leased to the City of Durango from 1950 until the railroad donated it to the Chamber of Commerce in 1968, and then was transferred to the city in December, 2000. The Durango Railroad Historical Society began restoration work in March 2001 and 315 moved under its own power for the first time in 57 years in August, 2007. The City of Durango transferred ownership of the locomotive to the Durango Railroad Historical Society in 2014.\n It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Locomotive No. 315 in 2008.",

  "/wiki/Durango-Silverton_Narrow-Gauge_Railroad": "The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, often abbreviated as the D&SNG, is a 3 ft (914 mm) narrow-gauge heritage railroad that operates 45.2 miles (72.7 km) of track between Durango and Silverton, in the U.S. state of Colorado. The railway is a federally designated National Historic Landmark and is also designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\n The route was originally opened in 1882 by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG) to transport silver and gold ore mined from the San Juan Mountains. The line was an extension of the D&RG 3\u00a0ft (914\u00a0mm) narrow-gauge line from Antonito, Colorado, to Durango. The last train to operate into Durango from the east was on December 6, 1968. The states of New Mexico and Colorado purchased 64 miles between Antonito and Chama, New Mexico, in 1970 and operates today as the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad. Trackage between Chama and Durango was removed by 1971.\n The line from Durango to Silverton has run continuously since 1881, although it is now a tourist and heritage line hauling passengers, and is one of the few places in the U.S. which has seen continuous use of steam locomotives. In March 1981, the Denver & Rio Grande Western sold the line and the D&SNG was formed.\n Some rolling stock dates back to the 1880s. Trains operate from Durango to the Cascade Wye in the winter months and Durango\u2013Silverton during the summer months. Durango depot was built in January 1882 and has been preserved in its original form.",
