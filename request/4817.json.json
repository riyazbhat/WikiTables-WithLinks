  "/wiki/The_Ashes": "The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and  Australia. The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, its first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\". The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882\u201383 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to \"regain those ashes\". The English media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the Ashes.",
