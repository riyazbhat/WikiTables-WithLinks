  "/wiki/It\u014d_Hirobumi": "Prince It\u014d Hirobumi (\u4f0a\u85e4 \u535a\u6587, 16 October 1841 \u2013 26 October 1909, born Hayashi Risuke and also known as Hirofumi, Hakubun and briefly during his youth as It\u014d Shunsuke) was a Japanese politician, Prime Minister and preeminent member of the Meiji oligarchy. A London-educated samurai of the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain and leader of the early Meiji Restoration government, he chaired the bureau which drafted the Meiji Constitution in the 1880s. Looking to the West for inspiration, It\u014d rejected the United States Constitution as too liberal and the Spanish Restoration as too despotic before ultimately drawing on the British and German models, particularly the Prussian Constitution of 1850. Dissatisfied with the prominent role of Christianity in European legal traditions, he substituted references to the more traditionally Japanese concept of kokutai or \"national polity\", which became the constitutional justification for imperial authority.\n In 1885, he became Japan's first Prime Minister, an office his constitutional bureau had introduced. He went on to hold the position four times, becoming one of the longest serving PMs in Japanese history, and wielded considerable power even out of office as a member of Japan's genr\u014d and occasional President of the Emperor's Privy Council. A monarchist, It\u014d favoured a large, bureaucratic government and opposed the formation of political parties. His third term in government was ended by the consolidation of the opposition into the Kenseit\u014d party in 1898, prompting him to found the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai party in response. He resigned his fourth and final ministry in 1901 after growing weary of party politics. \n It\u014d's foreign policy was ambitious. He strengthened diplomatic ties with Western powers including Germany, the United States and especially the United Kingdom. In Asia he oversaw the First Sino-Japanese War and negotiated Chinese surrender on terms aggressively favourable to Japan, including the annexation of Taiwan and the release of Korea from the Chinese Imperial tribute system. It\u014d sought to avoid a Russo-Japanese War through the policy of Man-Kan k\u014dkan \u2013 surrendering Manchuria to the Russian sphere of influence in exchange for the acceptance of Japanese hegemony in Korea. A diplomatic tour of the United States and Europe brought him to Saint Petersburg in November 1901, where he was unable to find compromise on this matter with Russian authorities. Soon the government of Katsura Tar\u014d elected to abandon the pursuit of Man-Kan k\u014dkan, and tensions with Russia continued to escalate towards war.\n The Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1905 made It\u014d the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea. He initially supported the sovereignty of the indigenous Joseon monarchy as a protectorate under Japan, but he eventually accepted and agreed with the increasingly powerful Imperial Japanese Army, which favoured the total annexation of Korea, resigning his position as Resident-General and taking a new position as the President of the Privy Council of Japan in 1909. Four months later, It\u014d was assassinated by Korean-independence activist and nationalist An Jung-geun in Manchuria. The annexation process was formalised by another treaty the following year after Ito's death. Through his daughter Ikuko, It\u014d was the father-in-law of politician, intellectual and author Suematsu Kench\u014d.",

  "/wiki/Han_school": "The han school (\u85e9\u6821, hank\u014d) was an educational institution in the Edo period of Japan, originally established to educate children of daimy\u014ds (feudal lords) and their retainers in the domains outside of the capital. These institutions were also known as hangaku (\u85e9\u5b66), hangakk\u014d (\u85e9\u5b66\u6821) or hank\u014d (\u85e9\u9ecc). \n These schools existed until 1871, when the domains were abolished after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. The han schools were at first narrowly defined as schools of Confucian studies for the cultivation of the samurai elite, and attendance was both expected of and limited to the children of this class. Late in the period, however, children of other social classes were permitted to attend, and the curriculum was expanded from its core in the Confucian classics to include training in classical Japanese studies (kokugaku), medicine, and the various branches of Western learning, including mathematics, astronomy, military science, and ballistics. Students entered at age 7 or 8 and usually completed their courses of study between the ages of 15 and 20. By the 1860s there were about 255 han schools nationwide.\n The han schools, which predominated in provincial regions, were similar to and paralleled the terakoya or \"temple-school\" system of education which was more prominent in the major urban centers of the capital, Edo, and Osaka and Kyoto. The major difference between two systems was that hanko were state institutions organized by the local domain government, and terakoya were private institutions organized by local Buddhist temples.\n Some of the more famous han schools included Nisshinkan (Aizu), K\u014dd\u014dkan (Mito), Meirind\u014d (Sendai), Meirinkan (Hagi, Yamaguchi) and Jish\u016bkan (Kumamoto).",

The style and form of the ruins matches many in Korea; the period when these were built was one of flourishing contact with Korea, and it is theorized that Korean stoneworkers, artisans, and architects may have played a role in the construction of these fortresses.
