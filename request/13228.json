Hair of the Dog uses a talk box extensively during its bridge. The song's title, which does not appear in the lyrics, is a pun (hair of the dog = heir of the dog = son of a bitch). As a standalone song, it only charted in Germany, where it peaked at #44. In the United States, because the Hair of the Dog album was a top-20 hit on the album charts, the song received extensive airplay on album-oriented rock stations (despite bitch being a borderline profanity) and remains in the playlist of most classic rock formatted stations.
