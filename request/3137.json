  "/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tracy": "The Trouble with Tracy is a Canadian television series produced by CTV for the 1970\u20131971 television season, with intended distribution by the U.S.-based National General Pictures. It is considered by some to be one of the worst situation comedies ever produced.\n The series was produced as a daily show, and aired weekday afternoons at 3:30 pm from September 14, 1970. The economic and time pressures of producing 130 episodes in a single season (seven shows were filmed every five days) meant cheap, wobbly sets, no outdoor filming, a laugh track instead of a live studio audience, the use of single takes, the reuse of 25-year-old radio scripts, and other shortcuts that resulted in a poor-quality product. Even flubbed lines and bloopers sometimes ended up airing, because the show could not afford retakes.",

Since it was intended for children who had graduated from CTW's flagship program, Sesame Street, the humor was more mature than what was seen there.[citation needed]",
