  "/wiki/GER_Class_T26": "The GER Class T26 was a class of 2-4-0 steam tender locomotives designed by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway.  At the 1923 grouping they passed to the London and North Eastern Railway, who classified them E4. Eighteen survived into British Railways ownership in 1948, and the last was withdrawn in 1959, making them the last 2-4-0s at work in Britain.  Their BR numbers were 62780\u201362797.",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_C32": "The GER Class C32 was a class of fifty 2-4-2T steam locomotives designed by James Holden and built by the company's Stratford Works between 1892 and 1902. They all passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 grouping and received the classification F3.",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_Y14": "The Great Eastern Railway (GER) Class Y14 is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive.  The LNER classified them J15.\n The Class Y14 was designed by T.W. Worsdell for both freight and passenger duties - a veritable 'maid of all work'. Introduced in July 1883, they were so successful that all the succeeding chief superintendents continued to build new batches down to 1913 with little design change, the final total being 289. During World War I, 43 of the engines served in France and Belgium.",
  "/wiki/LNER_Class_J39": "The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Class J39 was a class of medium powered 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed for mixed traffic work throughout the former LNER system between London and the north of Scotland.",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_T18": "The GER Class T18 was a class of fifty 0-6-0 tank steam locomotives designed by James Holden for the Great Eastern Railway.  They passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the grouping in 1923 and received the LNER classification J66.",
  "/wiki/LNER_Thompson_Class_B1": "The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Thompson Class B1 is a class of steam locomotive designed for medium mixed traffic work.  It was designed by Edward Thompson.",
  "/wiki/GNR_Class_C2": "The Great Northern Railway class C2 locomotives were a class of 4-4-2 tank locomotives built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) between 1898 and 1907. They were used on local and commuter passenger trains in Yorkshire and North London. They were withdrawn between 1937 and 1958.",
  "/wiki/GCR_Class_9L": "The Great Central Railway 9K and 9L classes were two related classes of 4-4-2T Atlantic steam locomotives. They were both intended for suburban passenger services. After the 1923 Grouping, they served the LNER as classes C13 and C14.\n Their designer was John G. Robinson. The design was based on the earlier Pollitt Class 9G 2-4-2T locomotives, but with a lengthened boiler and a leading bogie to carry it. This extension of running gear also resembled an early Robinson design for the Irish Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway.\n All passed into British Railways service and the first was not withdrawn until 1952. Most were withdrawn between 1955 and 1959. The last examples of each class, 9K 67417 and 9L 67450, were scrapped in 1960. None were preserved.",
  "/wiki/GNR_Class_H4": "The Great Northern Railway Class H4 (classified K3 by the LNER) was a class of 2-6-0 steam locomotive designed for mixed-traffic work.\n The type was a more powerful development of the earlier H3 (LNER K2) class and was notable at the time, as the 6-foot-diameter (1.8 m) boilers were the largest fitted to any British locomotive to that date. After formation of the London and North Eastern Railway, the type became known as class K3 and was adopted as an LNER standard design. They got the nickname \"Jazzers\" after the rhythm of their exhaust beat and the unbalanced gyratory movement.",
  "/wiki/GCR_Class_1B": "The GCR Class 1B was a class of 2-6-4T (tank) locomotives on the Great Central Railway. They were notable as the first locomotives of the 2-6-4T (or Adriatic) wheel arrangement to be used by a British standard-gauge railway; there had been two narrow-gauge examples on the Leek & Manifold Valley Light Railway since 1904.",
  "/wiki/GER_Class_L77": "The GER Class L77, LNER Class N7, is a class of 0-6-2T steam locomotives.  They were designed by Alfred John Hill of the Great Eastern Railway and introduced in 1915. The design was perpetuated by Nigel Gresley of the LNER after the 1923 grouping. 134 were built; only one of them is preserved.",
  "/wiki/BR_Standard_Class_7": "The BR Standard Class 7, otherwise known as the Britannia Class, is a class of 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotive designed under Robert Riddles for use by British Railways for mixed traffic duties.  55 were constructed between 1951 and 1954. The design employed results from the 1948 locomotive exchanges undertaken in advance of further locomotive classes being constructed.  Three batches were constructed at Crewe Works, before the publication of the 1955 Modernisation Plan.\n The Britannia Class design was based on best practice from the pre-nationalisation railway companies in terms of operating efficiency and lower maintenance costs; various weight-saving measures also increased the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive on the British Railways network. The Britannias received a positive reception from their crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving them favourable reports as regards performance.  However, operation in some areas of the British Railway network returned negative feedback, primarily due to indifferent operation of the locomotive, with its effects on adhering to timetables.\n The Britannias took their names from great Britons, former Star class locomotives, and Scottish firths.  The class remained in service until the last was withdrawn in 1968. Two survived into preservation, the first-of-class, number 70000 Britannia, and 70013 Oliver Cromwell. Number 70000 has hauled mainline excursions and 70013, after a period of display following limited steaming, returned to mainline steam in 2008 for the first time since leaving British Railways ownership. 70000 was returned to the main line in 2011.",
  "/wiki/Felixstowe_branch_line": "The Felixstowe branch line is a railway branch line in Suffolk, England, that connects the Great Eastern Main Line to Felixstowe and its port.\n The line is 12 miles 5 chains (19.4 km) in length from Westerfield to Felixstowe. The stations and all passenger services are currently operated by Greater Anglia. The passenger services originate at Ipswich but the branch itself starts one station further along at Westerfield. The line also carries freight trains operated by DB Schenker, Freightliner and GB Railfreight, to the port of Felixstowe.\n The line was opened by the Felixstowe Railway & Pier Company in 1877, although the first station in Felixstowe was not in the town but at the company's pier on the River Orwell. The railway was sold to the Great Eastern Railway in 1887. A station near Felixstowe town centre was opened in 1898 and this has been the only station in the town since 1967. Freight traffic has increased significantly since that time, leading to the opening of a second route to the port in 1987.\n As of December 2016 passenger service frequency on the line is typically one train per hour in each direction between Ipswich and Felixstowe. The timetabled journey time from one terminus to the other is 26 minutes."
