  "/wiki/Glynn_Academy": "Glynn Academy (GA) is an American public high school in Brunswick, Georgia, United States, enrolling 1,755 students in grades 9\u201312. Along with Brunswick High School, it is one of two high schools in the Glynn County School System. Glynn Academy offers technical, academic, and Advanced Placement programs and is accredited by the Georgia Department of Education and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The school has consistently been ranked among the top public high schools in the United States by Newsweek.\n Chartered by an act of the General Assembly on February 1, 1788, Glynn Academy is the second-oldest public high school in the American South and the sixth-oldest public high school in the United States; at its inception, the school embraced all grades of primary and secondary education. The first recorded building was built in 1819 on a tract of land known as Academy Range. A new building was erected in 1840 on Hillsborough Square, the present location of the school. From 1819 to 1840, the school was known as Glynn County Academy. Because of an unsatisfactory courthouse, the county's superior and inferior courts often met at the school from 1825 to 1884. In 1889, the Annex Building was constructed, followed by the Prep Junior High School in 1909 (later annexed to the school as the Prep Building), and the Glynn Academy Building in 1923. The original 1840 structure was moved out of the city in 1915; in 2008, it was relocated to the current campus where it serves as an interpretive museum.  The 1840 building itself is on the National Register of Historic Places and three other buildings (the Prep Building, 1905\u201309; the G.A. building, 1922; and the Annex, 1889) are contributing properties to the Brunswick Old Town Historic District.\n The school, in addition to serving sections of Brunswick (including Blythe Island), serves Brookman, Sea Island, and St. Simons Island. It also serves sections of Country Club Estates and Dock Junction.",
  "/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers_men's_basketball": "The Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represents Indiana University Bloomington in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Big Ten Conference. The Hoosiers play on Branch McCracken Court at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana on the Indiana University Bloomington campus. Indiana has won five NCAA Championships in men's basketball (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987) \u2013 the first two under coach Branch McCracken and the latter three under Bob Knight. Indiana's 1976 squad remains the last undefeated NCAA men's basketball champion.\n The Hoosiers are tied for sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (39), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (66), tied for eighth in Final Four appearances (8), and 11th in overall victories. The Hoosiers have won 22 Big Ten Conference Championships and have the best winning percentage in conference games at nearly 60 percent. No team has had more All-Big Ten selections than the Hoosiers with 53. The Hoosiers also rank seventh in all-time AP poll appearances (560) and sixth in the number of weeks spent ranked No. 1 (54). Every four-year men's basketball letterman since 1973 has earned a trip to the NCAA basketball tournament. Additionally, every four-year player since 1950 has played on a nationally ranked squad at Indiana.\n The Hoosiers are among the most storied programs in the history of college basketball. A 2019 study listed Indiana as the fifth most valuable collegiate basketball program in the country. Indiana has ranked in the top 20 nationally in men's basketball attendance every season since Assembly Hall opened in 1972, and often in the top five.\n Indiana has two main rivalries including in-state, against the Purdue Boilermakers (see Indiana\u2013Purdue rivalry), and out-of-state, against the Kentucky Wildcats (see Indiana\u2013Kentucky rivalry.)",
