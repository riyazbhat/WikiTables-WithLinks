It is currently undergoing gradual suburbanisation and is increasingly considered as a small town in terms of its population.  The name \u201cBalsall\u201d comes from the Anglo Saxon word \u201cBaelle\u201d meaning corner (or angle) of land, and \u201cHeale\u201d meaning a sheltered place \n The village is split between the civil parishes of Balsall, which also includes Balsall Street, Temple Balsall, and Fen End, and had a population of 7,039 according to the 2011 census. It also lies on the Heart of England Way.\n The village is of recent origin; most of the houses and shops were built in the 20th century. Previously, the village consisted of a couple of hamlets of about six to twelve houses each and a few scattered cottages - as this map of 1889 shows. In the 1930s there began the development which linked these isolated buildings, but it was not until after World War II that the village really began to grow.\n With its close proximity to the village of Meriden 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) away, which until recently was long-believed to be the geographic centre of England, Balsall Common is perceived to be one of the furthest places from the UK coastline. In fact Coton-in-the-Elms in south Derbyshire holds this designation, situated 23.5 miles (37.8\u00a0km) to the north. Nevertheless, Balsall Common's secondary school is named the Heart of England School. The local primary school is named Balsall Common Primary School.\n It is served by Berkswell railway station (actually in Balsall Common) on the Coventry-Birmingham line, and by bus to Solihull (service S2A/S2C).\n Other nearby towns and villages include Knowle, Kenilworth, Warwick, Hampton-in-Arden and Hatton.\n Since the late-1990s, plans for a bypass, a large national supermarket and larger swathes of new housing have so far been circumvented. This is mainly due to Balsall Common being situated at the heart of the West Midlands green belt area known as the Meriden Gap, between Solihull and Coventry, and is thus subject to strict planning regulations.

  "/wiki/Chadwick_End": "Chadwick End is a small village in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, situated 3 miles (5 km) southeast of the large village of Knowle and forming part of the border with Warwickshire. \n The name Chadwick means 'farm near a spring', and the village remains a farming community, almost contiguous with the historic Warwickshire village of Baddesley Clinton only half-a-mile to the south.[citation needed]\n A mile from the village centre lies Chadwick Manor and its Estate, built in 1875 by the architect Edward Holmes (1832-1909). During the 1930s the Manor became a country house hotel and the estate a racing-stud both owned by the Stewart MacKay family. Upon the death in 1980 of champion racehorse owner and breeder Captain Norman \"Norrie\" Stewart MacKay (1895-1980), the estate was sold and the Manor converted to luxury flats.[citation needed]\n The former Poor Clares convent on Rising Lane was founded in 1850; it has been converted into private flats since its closure in 2011.",
  "/wiki/Chelmsley_Wood": "Chelmsley Wood is a large housing estate and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, England, with a population of 12,453. It is located near Birmingham Airport and the National Exhibition Centre. It lies about eight miles east of Birmingham City Centre and 5 miles to the north of Solihull town centre.\n In 1966 Birmingham City Council compulsorily purchased the ancient woodland and built the 15,590 dwelling council estate to rehouse families on its council house waiting list. With the rise in unemployment in the 1970s parts of the estate suffered from deprivation and the resulting anti-social behaviour.\n Local government re-organisation in 1974 transferred the area to Solihull Metropolitan Borough, though responsibility for the housing remained with Birmingham until September 1980.\n The boundaries of Chelmsley Wood have changed since its inception as neighbouring districts have merger and areas within the plan have become independent settlements. The estate itself, now known as North Solihull, is being renovated and extended.",
