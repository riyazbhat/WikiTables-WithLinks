  "/wiki/Benicia_Arsenal": "The Benicia Arsenal (1851\u20131964) and Benicia Barracks (1852\u201366) were part of a large military reservation located next to Suisun Bay in Benicia, California. For over 100 years, the arsenal was the primary US Army Ordnance facility for the West Coast of the United States. In 1847 a 252-acre (102 ha) parcel of land adjoining the Benicia city limits on the east was acquired for a military reserve. First occupation of the post was on April 9, 1849, when two companies of the 2nd Infantry Regiment set up camp to establish Benicia Barracks, which also housed the 3rd Artillery Regiment. In 1851, after the urging of General Persifor F. Smith, the first Ordnance Supply Depot in the West was established in Benicia. In 1852 it was designated Benicia Arsenal. Notable military personnel who were stationed there during this time include Ulysses Grant, Edward Ord, and Joseph Hooker, among others. The grounds of the Benicia Arsenal are also famous for stabling one of the elements of the Army's Camel Corps.",

  "/wiki/Rockville_Stone_Chapel": "An outgrowth of local camp meetings, Rockville Stone Chapel was constructed in the Fall of 1856, in use by Christmas of that year, and dedicated in February 1857.  Divisions in the congregation over slavery soon split the congregation, with the Northern faction splitting off at Christmas Eve 1863 to form their own church.  Attendance at the chapel slowly declined, with the last resident pastor leaving in 1895.  Although services continued sporadically, the building fell into disrepair and, in 1929, the chapel was donated to the County of Solano.  With the onset of the Great Depression that year, restoration did not occur for another decade, with the WPA finally accomplishing a full renovation in the Spring of 1940.  Declared a State Historical Landmark in October 1962, the chapel continues in use today (2019), serving as the sanctuary for the local Church of Christ congregation and also hosting weddings and funerals.",
