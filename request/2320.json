  "/wiki/Diamer-Bhasha_Dam": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some part in Diamer, Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. Its foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan on 1998. Upon completion, Diamer-Bhasha Dam would be the highest dam in the world. The dam site is situated near a place called Bhasha in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan, hence the name. Upon completion, Diamer-Bhasha Dam would (i) produce 4800 megawatts of electricity through hydro-power generation; (ii) store an extra 10.5 cubic kilometres (8,500,000 acre\u22c5ft) of water for Pakistan that would be used for irrigation and drinking; (iii) extend the life of Tarbela Dam located downstream by 35 years; and (iv) control flood damage by the River Indus downstream during high floods. However, in response to using Basha Dam to sideline the Kalabagh Dam, Engineer Anwer Khurshid has stated that Bhasha dam is no substitute for Kalabagh dam not because of its altitude which is high enough, but because no irrigation canals can be taken out from it because of the hilly terrain. No canals can be taken out from any dam on the Indus except from Kalabagh Dam. It is planned to have a height of 272 meters spillway with fourteen gates each 11.5 m \u00d7 16.24 m. The gross capacity of the reservoir will be 10 cubic kilometres (8,100,000 acre\u22c5ft), with a live storage of 7.9 cubic kilometres (6,400,000 acre\u22c5ft). Two underground powerhouses are being proposed, one on each side of the main dam having six turbines on each side with a total installed capacity of 4500 MW.",

It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th Amendment to Pakistan's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy, though it is geographically the smallest of four. Within Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad. It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan's total population, with the majority of the province's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers. The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara, including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda. Originally a stronghold of Buddhism, the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions by various empires due to its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass. Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004. With the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency, the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011-13, with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. As of July 2014, about 929,859 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb.

A scholar of Kal\u0101m is referred to as a mutakallim (plural: mutakallim\u016bn), and it is a role distinguished from those of Islamic philosophers, jurists, and scientists. The Arabic term Kal\u0101m means speech, word, utterance among other things, and its use regarding Islamic theology is derived from the expression Word of God (Kal\u0101m All\u0101h) found in the Qur'an. Murtada Mutahhari describes Kal\u0101m as a discipline devoted to discuss the fundamental Islamic beliefs and doctrines which are necessary for a Muslim to believe in. It explains them, argues about them, and defends them (see also Five Pillars of Islam). There are many possible interpretations as to why this discipline was originally called so; one is that the widest controversy in this discipline has been about whether the Word of God, as revealed in the Qur'an, can be considered part of God's essence and therefore not created, or whether it was made into words in the normal sense of speech, and is therefore created.",
