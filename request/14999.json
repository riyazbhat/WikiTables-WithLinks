She subsequently dropped 'Lengthorn' from her name and is now known professionally as Laura Massaro.\n She won her first top-level title at the German Open in 2004 and went on to become British Open champion in 2013 and World Champion in 2014, so become the first Englishwoman to hold both titles at once.

Her achievement, alongside that of reigning men's world champion Nick Matthew, meant that England had two reigning world squash champions for the first time.\n Massaro's exceptional 2014 season continued when she was runner-up to David at the British Open in Hull in May.\n At the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in July, Massaro went unbeaten through the women's singles \u2013 including a semi-final against compatriot Alison Waters \u2013 before falling to David in the gold medal match. She and Duncalf then joined forces in the doubles and won through to the final, where they lost to Indians Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa in straight games.\n October saw Massaro reach the quarter-finals of the US Open, where she lost to Nour El-Sherbini. After a string of lacklustre performances throughout late 2014 and early 2015, she progressed to her third British Open final in succession before losing out to eventual victor Camille Serme.\n Massaro started her 2015/16 season in strong fashion as she achieved victory at the US Open and Qatar Classic.

Such was her precocious talent that she was already competing on the WISPA Tour in her mid teens.

These results propelled her into the Top 20.\n A noted encounter was between Engy and Nour El Sherbini, the 13 year old Egyptian who then made history by becoming the youngest player ever to reach the final of a WISPA World Tour squash event, in June 2009 at Cairo. Kheirallah was then ranked 22 in the world and was the top seed of the ATCO Miro Classic No1 tournament at Cairo. The final score was a dramatic encounter of 11-8, 11-9, 7-11, 7-11, 11-7 which lasted well over one hour.\n The rivalry between Engy and Abdel Kawy continued in the following years when they faced in the first all-Egyptian final of Women's Hurghada International in 2010. Before this final, Abdel Kawy had lost to Kheirallah in all their previous five Tour meetings since 2005, despite being ranked ahead of Engy throughout Kawy's career.
