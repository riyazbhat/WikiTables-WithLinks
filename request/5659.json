The name is a play on the terms Far East and East of Eden. The series was conceived by Oji Hiroi and developed by Red Company, debuting on the PC Engine CD-ROM\u00b2 System in 1989. Based on the Japanese folk tale Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari, the series became widely popular in Japan, where it was one of the most popular RPG series during the 16-bit era, along with Enix's Dragon Quest and Squaresoft's Final Fantasy. Its success was partly because the original Tengai Makyou was the first RPG released for the new CD-ROM format, which it utilized to create a bigger game and introduce fully voiced animated cut scenes and CD music to the genre. Though originally intended to be only three games, it has grown to encompass a number of remakes, gaidens and genre spin-offs across a variety of platforms. Despite its relative popularity in Asian countries, the series is largely unknown in other territories, with only one game released overseas.",
