  "/wiki/John_Kelly_(NYPD_Blue)": "John Kelly is a fictional character in the television series NYPD Blue, portrayed by David Caruso. The character appeared in the first season and the first four episodes of the second season. An Irish-American who was promoted to the rank of detective at the relatively early age of 28, Kelly was a brilliant and oft-smoldering cop, whose father was a heroic cop who was murdered in the line of duty. John Kelly Sr. was a member of the previously Irish American-dominated police department who according to fellow officer Jack Hanlon would have made Chief of Detectives had he not been killed. Kelly always managed to stay just on the right side of the law, usually keeping his hotter headed partner Andy Sipowicz under control. This changed when he became involved with a uniformed cop, Janice Licalsi, who murdered a mob boss named Angelo Marino who had ordered her to kill Kelly. Licalsi did this as her father, also a cop, was on the payroll of the mob boss and she was trying to protect him. Eventually Licalsi was investigated and Kelly allowed her to destroy evidence that would have pointed to her involvement in the murder.",
