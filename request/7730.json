The three largest towns are Llanelli, Carmarthen and Ammanford. Carmarthen is the county town and administrative centre.\n Carmarthenshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The county town was founded by the Romans, and the region was part of the Principality of Deheubarth in the High Middle Ages. After invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13th centuries it was subjugated, along with other parts of Wales, by Edward I of England. There was further unrest in the early 15th century, when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r, and during the English Civil War.\n Carmarthenshire is mainly an agricultural county, apart from the southeastern part which was once heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In the north of the county, the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. The economy depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base, and the low profitability of the livestock sector.\n Carmarthenshire, as a tourist destination, offers a wide range of outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. The sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine are further west. Carmarthenshire has a number of medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is at Laugharne.",

A similar definition is used by the BBC. The Wales Spatial Plan defines a region known as \"Central Wales\" which covers Ceredigion and Powys. If Mid Wales is classed as Ceredigion and Powys, the area would be 6,962 square kilometres (2,688\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about the size of Cumbria).\n Mid Wales is dominated by the Cambrian Mountains, including the Green Desert of Wales.

During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom. It has been administered as a county since 1282. Welsh is spoken by more than half the population.  Ceredigion is considered to be a centre of Welsh culture. The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles (80\u00a0km) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland. The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay.\n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Cardiganshire had more industry than it does today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the 20th century, livestock farming became less profitable, and the county's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated. However, there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement, and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.\n Ceredigion's population at the 2011 UK census was 75,900. Its largest town, Aberystwyth, is one of its two administrative centres, the other being Aberaeron, where Ceredigion County Council meets. Aberystwyth houses Aberystwyth University, Bronglais Hospital and the National Library of Wales. Lampeter is home to part of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

It is known mostly as the general location of a wind farm.\n The initial three turbines were erected in 2002, and started generating in January 2003; each turbine is capable of producing 1300\u00a0kW. This scheme marked erection of the UK wind industry's 1000th turbine and was initially welcomed, as it had been set up by three local farmers to boost their incomes, under the name of Cwmni Gwynt Teg (\"Fair Wind Company\"). After commissioning, however, it was opposed by some, not least because, although not located in the Snowdonia National Park itself, the turbines are visible from many parts of it.\n Of the three turbines, two were owned and operated by the local farming co-operative; the third was owned and operated by Energiekontor UK Ltd, the UK subsidiary of the German wind development company Energiekontor AG, which was instrumental in the finance and construction of the wind farm.\n The electricity produced goes to the local Llanrwst sub-station 4.5\u00a0km away, and is sold to the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency.\n Under the project name of \"Ail Wynt\" (Second Wind), Cwmni Gwynt Teg planned a further 11 turbines but this was rejected[who?]. Despite further opposition an amended plan for an additional 9 turbines was passed, and these were built and commissioned in 2008 \"within a more compact area and at reduced height\".\n Cwmni Gwynt Teg won an Ashden Award in 2003 for its work on the wind farm.",

The Round 1 projects were intended to act as testbeds; building the UK's understanding of offshore wind power, whilst in total also providing well over 1,000\u00a0MW of green generating capacity for the UK. All of the Round\u00a01 offshore wind farms were limited to a maximum area of 10 square kilometres (3.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and no more than 30\u00a0wind turbines.\n The wind farm's 30\u00a0Vestas V80 Offshore wind turbines are each rated at 2\u00a0MW capacity, giving a maximum project output of 60\u00a0MW.  At the time of installation this was the most powerful wind farm in the UK, producing sufficient electricity annually to power 50,000\u00a0homes.\nBetween 2004 and 2010, the capacity factor was between 33 and 36%.\n Independent surveys carried out for the operators of North Hoyle have shown that the wind farm is very popular among holidaymakers and local residents. An opinion poll carried out in 2003, after its construction, showed that 73% of people expressed support for the project and only 5% opposed it.\n North Hoyle was developed, built and is operated by RWE npower renewables (formerly National Wind Power); npower renewables also own the neighbouring Rhyl Flats and Gwynt y M\u00f4r offshore wind farms.",
  "/wiki/Liverpool_Bay": "Liverpool Bay is a bay of the Irish Sea between northeast Wales, Cheshire, Lancashire and Merseyside to the east of the Irish Sea. The bay is a classic example of a region of freshwater influence. Liverpool Bay has historically suffered from reduced oxygen content from prior massive discharges of sewage sludge, according to C.Michael Hogan.\n The rivers Alt, Clwyd, Dee, Ribble and Mersey drain into the bay. The bay is littered with wrecks and has many dive sites.  The bay also contains several oil and gas fields including the Douglas Complex, with a combined daily capacity (January 2008) of 60,000\u00a0barrels.  The UK's first major offshore wind farm, North Hoyle, is located in the south of the bay, which is a busy shipping route to the Mersey Docks.\n The land area around the bay is occasionally referred to as the \"Liverpool Bay Area\". Though the term is seen by some as a possible official alternative to Merseyside, it is more often used to describe a much wider area which may include the West Lancashire towns of Ormskirk and Skelmersdale to the north, St Helens and Warrington to the east and Chester plus North Wales to the south. In this sense, it is often promoted by local thinkers and urbanists to encourage regional co-operation in both economic and cultural terms. It is not recognised by the British Government as a strategic economic sub-region, however. Despite having its advocates, the term is still not particularly common in the area.\n The English portion of Liverpool Bay is one of the 120 natural areas into which England is divided by Natural England for conservation purposes.",
