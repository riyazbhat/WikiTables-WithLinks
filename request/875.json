  "/wiki/Tower_mill": "A tower mill is a type of vertical windmill consisting of a brick or stone tower, on which sits a wooden 'cap' or roof, which can rotate to bring the sails into the wind.\n This rotating cap on a firm masonry base gave tower mills great advantages over earlier post mills, as they could stand much higher, bear larger sails, and thus afford greater reach into the wind.  Windmills in general had been known to civilization for centuries, but the tower mill represented an improvement on traditional western-style windmills.  The tower mill was an important source of power for Europe for nearly 600 years from 1300\u20131900, contributing to 25 percent of the industrial power of all wind machines before the advent of the steam engine and coal power.\n It represented a modification or a demonstration of improving and adapting technology that had been known by humans for ages.  Although these types of mills were effective, some argue that, owing to their complexity, they would have initially been built mainly by the most wealthy individuals.",

  "/wiki/List_of_windmills_in_Malta": "This is a list of windmills in Malta, that include those on Malta and Gozo. Most windmills (Maltese: imtie\u0127en tar-ri\u0127) in Malta were built while the islands were under the rule of the Order of St. John, by the Cottoner and the Manoel Foundations, while other were built in the British Colonial period. There are 48 windmills (apart from those demolished that would add up to at least 69) which were included on the antiques list of 1932 and scheduled as cultural buildings by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA). The windmills form an integral part of Maltese history. Those in the countryside were used exclusively for food production, such as wheat, barley or vines, while some of those within the fortified walled cities in Valletta and the Three Cities had a military use, for the production of gunpowder. At the time of construction, each windmills' tower could site the next windmill from distance, similar to military watchtowers, in order to learn whether the others are working on that day. An instrument called bronja, colloquially known as tronga, is commonly associated with the functioning of windmills. The tronja is a sea snail that is modified, with a hole at one end, and when blown it creates a strong noise reaching a large distance in a given Maltese village."
