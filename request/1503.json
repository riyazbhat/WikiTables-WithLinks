In 1568, the Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to visit them, naming them the Islas Salom\u00f3n. Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomon Islands archipelago in June 1893, when Captain Gibson R.N., of HMS Curacoa, declared the southern Solomon Islands a British protectorate. During World War II, the Solomon Islands campaign (1942\u20131945) saw fierce fighting between the United States and the Empire of Japan, such as in the Battle of Guadalcanal. The official name of the then British administration was changed from the British Solomon Islands Protectorate to the Solomon Islands in 1975, and self-government was achieved the following year. Independence was obtained, and the name changed to just Solomon Islands (without the definite article), in 1978.",

  "/wiki/Governor-General_of_Solomon_Islands": "The Governor-General of Solomon Islands is the resident representative of the Solomon Islands' monarch, currently Elizabeth II. The Queen does not reside in the country but appoints a Governor-General to act on her behalf, subordinate to her, for a five-year term. Although the office holds considerable reserve powers, it is largely a symbolic figurehead position with little day-to-day involvement in government.\n Solomon Islands is a Commonwealth realm and, following independence in 1978, adopted a constitutional monarchy based on, but separate from, that of the United Kingdom. Prior to the country's independence and the establishment of this office, the islands were governed by a Governor and the Executive Council.\n The Governors-General of the majority of Commonwealth realms are nominated by the Prime Minister of each realm and appointed by the Queen but in Solomon Islands, the Governor-General is nominated by the National Parliament by vote and appointed by the Queen.  Although the nominee is elected by Parliament the Queen is not bound to accept that nomination for appointment, although she is likely to dissent only in extraordinary circumstances.\n The current Governor-General is  David Vunagi, a retired Solomon Islands Anglican bishop, who was nominated unopposed in June 2019.",
  "/wiki/Tuvalu": "Tuvalu (/tu\u02d0\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0lu\u02d0/ too-VAH-loo) (formerly known as the Ellice Islands), is a country in Polynesia, located in the Pacific Ocean, situated in Oceania and about midway between Hawaii and Australia. The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands (which belong to the Solomon Islands), southeast of Nauru, south of Kiribati, west of Tokelau, northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna, and north of Fiji. It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, west of the International Date Line. Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 (2017 census). The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi). The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians. The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago. During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes.",
