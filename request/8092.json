It is located in the Aburr\u00e1 Valley, a central region of the Andes Mountains in South America. According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics, the city had an estimated population of 2,427,129 according to the 2018 census. With its surrounding area that includes nine other cities, the metropolitan area of Medell\u00edn is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Colombia in terms of population and economy, with more than 3.7 million people. In 1616 the Spaniard Francisco Herrera Campuzano erected a small indigenous village (poblado) known as Saint Lawrence of Aburr\u00e1 (San Lorenzo de Aburr\u00e1), located in the present-day El Poblado commune. On 2 November 1675, the queen consort Mariana of Austria founded the Town of Our Lady of Candelaria of Medell\u00edn (Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de Medell\u00edn) in the An\u00e1 region, which today corresponds to the center of the city (east-central zone) and first describes the region as Medell\u00edn. In 1826, the city was named the capital of the Department of Antioquia by the National Congress of the nascent Republic of Gran Colombia, comprised by present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. After Colombia won its independence from Spain, Medell\u00edn became the capital of the Federal State of Antioquia until 1888, with the proclamation of the Colombian Constitution of 1886. During the 19th century, Medell\u00edn was a dynamic commercial center, first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee. At the beginning of the 21st century, the city regained industrial dynamism, with the construction of the Medell\u00edn Metro commuter rail, liberalized development policies, improved security and improved education. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have lauded the city as a pioneer of a post-Washington consensus local development state model of economic development. The city is promoted internationally as a tourist destination and is considered a global city type Gamma - by GaWC.",

It comprises thirty-two departments, with the capital in Bogot\u00e1. Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations, European settlement, forced African labor, and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East. Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast. Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE, including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and the Tairona. Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region, establishing the New Kingdom of Granada, with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital. Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819, but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved, with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada. The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. Panama seceded in 1903, leading to Colombia's present borders. Beginning in the 1960s, the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s.

Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821, and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, and the decisive battle of Ayacucho, Peru completed its independence in 1824. In the ensuing years, the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability, which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile. Throughout the 20th century, Peru endured armed territorial disputes, coups, social unrest, and internal conflicts, as well as periods of stability and economic upswing. Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency, though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent. Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017.",

In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan (part of Mexico City), which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain. The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith, although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s. The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence. The post-independence period was tumultuous, characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes.",

The Dry Port of the Community of Madrid [es] is located in Coslada, which has become a major logistics hub in the country. Due to the area's close proximity to the Madrid-Barajas Airport and the Dry Port, the stretch of industrial cities from Madrid to Guadalajara along the A-2 freeway (known as the Corredor del Henares and more recently the golden mile of online sales) has, since the 1990s, grown into a logistics hub, similar to East Midlands in England, with the entire area now boasting 5.7 million m\u00b2 of logistics space in total. With investment from foreign funds and socimis, the logistics sector has grown rapidly thanks to increases in internet shopping. As Coslada runs out of space, other logistics companies have started to move into nearby cities such as Marchamalo, San Fernando de Henares, and Torija. A large percentage of Coslada's population works at the airport. Most Spanish transportation and shipping companies have branch offices in Coslada; the city is host to 706 logistics companies, the most in the country. El Corte Ingl\u00e9s operates a distribution center in the city, and delivery company Nacex opened a new distribution center in November 2018.
