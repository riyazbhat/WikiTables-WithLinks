Opening the ceremony was the famous 1970's band Earth, Wind & Fire with a comedic version of \"September\", in collaboration with The Black Eyed Peas. The ceremony featured tributes to ABC-TV anchor Peter Jennings (who died seven weeks earlier) presented by rival anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, and to talk show host Johnny Carson (who died on January 23, 2005) by close friend and Late Show host David Letterman.

The ceremony attracted 16.2 million viewers, 2\u00bd million fewer than the previous year's ceremony, but still the ratings winner for the week. The Discovery Channel received its first major nomination this year.\n This awards show was the first in fourteen years to be held in August because of NBC's request; because of NBC Sunday Night Football, the ceremony moved to accommodate NFL Kickoff Weekend.\n A new voting system determined nominees in particular categories (mostly lead acting and outstanding series categories) by a \"blue ribbon\" panel of judges, which resulted in the exclusion of popular shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost, and actors like Hugh Laurie from House. Lost's exclusion was mocked during the opening sequence (see below), when O'Brien, accompanied by Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes, heads down a hatch to get to the Emmys. O'Brien asked Reyes if he wanted to come; Reyes says coyly, \"Well, we weren't exactly invited\", to which O'Brien replies \"But you won last year!\"\n For its second season, The Office won Outstanding Comedy Series; this was its only major award. No comedy series won more than two major awards this year. In the drama field, 24 won Outstanding Drama Series for its fifth season, after being nominated and losing the previous four years.  It was also the first time the Fox Network won this award.  Its three major awards topped all drama series. Its Outstanding Lead Actor, Drama award (for Kiefer Sutherland) was also the first time Fox had won this award.\n Ellen Burstyn was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for her role in Mrs. Harris, even though she was onscreen for only fourteen seconds, which caused controversy.\n The show that received the most major nominations was Grey's Anatomy, with eight. The top-nominated show had not received so few nominations since 1970, when Marcus Welby, M.D. received six. However, there were far fewer nominations back then, with most categories having three slots making this ceremony unique.\n The pilot episode of My Name Is Earl joined a select group of TV episodes to win for both directing and writing.",

Many critics cited lackluster performances from the five hosts as a reason for the huge decline. Others pointed to the field of nominees which were dominated by low-rated and sparsely viewed programs, thus making the Emmys widely considered as a bust, which was panned by critics as \"... the worst ever, laid a big, fat ratings egg as well ...\"\n In 2011, when TV Guide Network re-did their list of \"25 Biggest TV Blunders\", this ceremony was included.\n For the first time in a decade, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series was won by the defending champion. 30 Rock was the top show of the night receiving five major awards, including the top prize. It also made history when it tied the record for most major nominations by a comedy series of 13 set by The Cosby Show in 1986; it would break this record the next year. It set another record when it received seven nominations in the guest acting categories, a mark that has not been matched since.\n Outstanding Drama Series went to AMC freshmen series Mad Men.
