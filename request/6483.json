  "/wiki/Terrestrial_television": "Terrestrial television is a type of television broadcasting in which the television signal is transmitted by radio waves from the terrestrial (Earth-based) transmitter of a television station to a TV receiver having an antenna.  The term terrestrial is more common in Europe and Latin America, while in the United States it is called broadcast or over-the-air television (OTA).  The term \"terrestrial\" is used to distinguish this type from the newer technologies of satellite television (direct broadcast satellite or DBS television), in which the television signal is transmitted to the receiver from an overhead satellite, cable television, in which the signal is carried to the receiver through a cable, and Internet Protocol television, in which the signal is received over an Internet stream or on a network utilizing the Internet Protocol.  Terrestrial television stations broadcast on television channels with frequencies between about 52 and 600\u00a0MHz in the VHF and UHF bands.  Since radio waves in these bands travel by line of sight, reception is limited by the visual horizon to distances of 40\u201360 miles (64\u201397\u00a0km).",

  "/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency": "Ultra high frequency (UHF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies in the range between 300\u00a0megahertz (MHz) and 3\u00a0gigahertz (GHz), also known as the decimetre band as the wavelengths range from one meter to one tenth of a meter (one decimeter). Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the super-high frequency (SHF) or microwave frequency range. Lower frequency signals fall into the VHF (very high frequency) or lower bands.  UHF radio waves propagate mainly by line of sight; they are blocked by hills and large buildings although the transmission through building walls is strong enough for indoor reception. They are used for television broadcasting, cell phones, satellite communication including GPS, personal radio services including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, walkie-talkies, cordless phones, and numerous other applications.",
