  "/wiki/County_Route_106_(Rockland_County,_New_York)": "County Route 106 (CR 106) is a 7.8-mile (12.6 km) east\u2013west county route in Rockland County, New York, in the United States. It serves as an eastward continuation of Kanawauke Road (former Orange CR 106), extending from the Orange County line to U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and US 202 in Stony Point via Harriman State Park. CR 106 intersects with several county highways in Rockland County along the way. The route was only one of two in Rockland County to keep its numbering from Orange County, with the other being CR 72. CR 106 had one spur route, CR 106A, which was recently decommissioned. The route was originally designated County Highway 416 in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1930, it became the easternmost part of New York State Route 210 (NY 210), a state highway continuing westward into Orange County. In 1982, NY 210 was truncated to end in Greenwood Lake, and its former routing east of NY 17 was replaced by CR 106 in Orange and Rockland counties.",

  "/wiki/County_Route_106_(Orange_County,_New_York)": "County Route 106 (CR 106) in the county of Orange County, New York was a continuation of two routes, New York State Route 17A (NY 17A) at its western terminus and Rockland CR 106 at the eastern terminus. Route 106 began at an intersection with NY 17A and its parent route, NY 17 in Southfields, where CR 106 signs are still posted according to the August 2018 Google Street View images. The route went eastward through Harriman State Park, crossing Seven Lakes Drive before entering nearby Rockland County, New York. There it became Rockland County Route 106 and heads all the way to Stony Point. CR 106 was originally a part of NY 210. When Route 210 was assigned in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering, it stretched from the New Jersey border in Greenwood Lake, over the current alignments of NY 17A, Orange CR 106 and Rockland CR 106, all the way to Stony Point. During a maintenance swap in 1980, NY 210 was truncated all the way back to NY 17A north of Greenwood Lake, and the route was replaced by both County Route 106s. CR 106 in Orange County was decommissioned on January 1, 2014, when maintenance of the road was transferred to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.",
