The overall Wizard of Oz theming of the hotel and casino provided the motto to literally follow the yellow brick road from inside the hotel to the entrance to the theme park, which was built on the hotel's backlot. Opened on December 18, 1993, along with the rest of the complex, the then 33-acre (13.4 ha) MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park looked like a small-version of larger counterparts Disney's Hollywood Studios and Universal Studios, which utilized a movie studio-backlot theme. During a later expansion of the hotel's pool and convention facilities, the area of the park was reduced by 40% to an area of 18.8 acres (7.6 ha). For 2001, the theme park was renamed The Park at MGM Grand and served as a rental facility for corporate functions, before being closed permanently in 2002.
