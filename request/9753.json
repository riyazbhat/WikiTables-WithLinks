Lake Papakeechie was named after him. Papakeecha was about 60 years old when white men entered the area. He was described as dark copper in color with a silver ring through his nose. Historical accounts have him weighing 300 pounds. He claimed to have participated in the Battle of Tippecanoe. In 1828 he was given reservation land totalling 36 square miles (93 km2) which nearly bisected Lake Wawasee north to south. He was the brother of Miami chief Wawasee (Wau-wa-aus-see), who Lake Wawasee was named after.",

  "/wiki/Continental_divide": "A continental divide is a drainage divide on a continent such that the drainage basin on one side of the divide feeds into one ocean or sea, and the basin on the other side either feeds into a different ocean or sea, or else is endorheic, not connected to the open sea. Every continent on earth except Antarctica (which has no free-flowing surface water) has at least one continental drainage divide; islands, even small ones like Killiniq Island on the Labrador Sea in Canada, may also host part of a continental divide or have their own island-spanning divide. The endpoints of a continental divide may be coastlines of gulfs, seas or oceans, the boundary of an endorheic basin, or another continental divide. One case, the Great Basin Divide, is a closed loop around an endoreic basin. The endpoints where a continental divide meets the coast are not always definite since the exact border between adjacent bodies of water is usually not clearly defined. The International Hydrographic Organization's publication Limits of Oceans and Seas defines exact boundaries of oceans, but it is not universally recognized. Where a continental divide meets an endorheic basin, such as the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming, the continental divide splits and encircles the basin. Where two divides intersect, they form a triple divide, where three watersheds meet.",
  "/wiki/Indiana_State_Road_13": "State Road 13 (SR 13) is a north\u2013south state road in the US state of Indiana. The southern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Highway 36 (US 36) and SR 67, in the town of Fortville, and its northern terminus is at the Michigan state line. At its northern end, signage for SR 13 ends at the interchange with the Indiana Toll Road; the highway continues unsigned for an additional 0.6 miles (0.97 km) running concurrently with US 131 to the state line. The state road runs through six counties in central and north-central Indiana mostly through rural farm fields and small towns. Dating back to the early days of the state road system, SR 13 was first signed in the eastern and northeastern part of the state. It was moved to its modern routing in 1931, running in two segments with the southern end in Indianapolis and the northern end at the Michigan state line. During the late 1930s, SR 13 was moved onto its modern routing in far southern Elkhart County. The southern end was moved from Indianapolis to Greenfield in the late 1930s or early 1940s.",

  "/wiki/Kosciusko_County_Jail": "The first jail was built in 1837 of 14 inches (36 cm) square logs. It was two stories tall with a trap door from the second story floor to access the ground floor. The next jail was made of brick. Like the first jail, it was located on Courthouse Square. By 1869 this second structure was in serious need of repair. Frequent jail breaks from the second jail, led the county to hire George Garnsey of Chicago to design a new jail. The most notable jailbreak resulted when prisoners pushed bricks out of the wall. The Castellated Gothic design represents the late 1800s American jail design standards.",

It flows from Big Lake in Noble County to the Wabash River near what is now Battle Ground, about 12 miles (19 km) northeast of Lafayette. The name Tippecanoe was derived from a Miami-Illinois word for buffalo fish, reconstructed as */kiteepihkwana/ or as kiteepihkwana siipiiwi.\n The Tippecanoe River is fed by 88 natural lakes and has a drainage area of 1,250,000 acres (5,100 km2), spanning 14 counties. It supports more numerous imperiled species and overall species diversity than most streams of the upper Midwest. The Nature Conservancy has identified it as one of the top ten rivers in the United States to preserve due to its ecological diversity and the high proportion of endangered species found in it.",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_30": "U.S. Route 30 or U.S. Highway 30 (US 30) is an east\u2013west main route in the system of the United States Numbered Highways, with the highway traveling across the northern tier of the country. With a length of 3,073 miles (4,946 km), it is the third longest U.S. highway, after U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 6. The western end of the highway is at US 101 in Astoria, Oregon; the eastern end is at Virginia Avenue, Absecon Boulevard, and Adriatic Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Despite long stretches of parallel and concurrent Interstate Highways, it has not been decommissioned unlike other long haul routes such as U.S. Route 66. The 0 as the last number in the digit indicates that it is a coast-to-coast route and a major east-west route. Much of the historic Lincoln Highway, the first road across America (from New York City to San Francisco), became part of US 30; it is still known by that name in many areas. US 30 and US 20 break the general U.S. Route numbering guidelines in Oregon, since US 20 actually starts south of US 30 in Newport, Oregon and US 30 runs parallel to the north throughout the state (the Columbia River and Interstate 84). The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell, Idaho.",
