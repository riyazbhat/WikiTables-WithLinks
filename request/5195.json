  "/wiki/Dodge_WC_series": "The Dodge WC series was a prolific range of light 4WD and medium 6WD military utility trucks, produced by Dodge / Fargo during World War II.[nb 3] Together with the \u200b1\u20444-ton jeeps produced by Willys and Ford, the Dodge \u200b1\u20442-tons and \u200b3\u20444-tons made up nearly all of the light 4WD trucks supplied to the U.S. military in WWII \u2013 with Dodge contributing some 337,500 4WD units[nb 4] (about half as many as the jeep[nb 5]). Contrary to the versatility of the highly standardized jeep, which was mostly achieved through field modification, the Dodge WC\u2011series came in many different, purpose-built, but mechanically uniform variants from the factory, much akin to the later family of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. The WC series evolved out of, and was part of a more extended family of trucks, with great mechanical parts commonality, that included open- and closed-cab cargo trucks and weapons carriers, (radio) command cars, reconnaissance vehicles, ambulances, carryalls, panel vans, and telephone installation and mobile emergency / field workshop trucks.\n From 1940 to 1942, almost 82,400  G-505 \u200b1\u20442-ton 4x4 Dodge trucks were built \u2014 initially called the VC series, but the great majority (from 1941) in the WC series, and in more variants. However in 1942, the truck grew into the G-502 \u200b3\u20444-ton 4x4 Truck (Dodge) and the G-507 1\u200b1\u20442-ton 6x6 personnel and cargo truck (Dodge) \u2014 retaining the Dodge WC model code. Although the \u200b3\u20444-tons featured significant design improvements, they retained some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the \u200b1\u20442-ton models.\n Dodge was the U.S. Army's main supplier of \u200b1\u20442-ton trucks, and its sole supplier of both \u200b3\u20444-ton trucks and 1\u200b1\u20442-ton six-by-six trucks in World War\u00a0II. With over a quarter million units built through August 1945, the G502 \u200b3\u20444-tons were the most common variants in the WC\u2011series.\nAfter the war, Dodge developed the \u200b3\u20444-ton WC\u2011series into the civilian 4x4 Power Wagons; and in 1951, the WCs were replaced by the very similar \u200b3\u20444-ton 4x4 Dodge M-series vehicles .\n WC was not an abbreviation of \"Weapons Carrier\", but a Dodge model code \u2013 initially W for 1941, and C for half-ton rating. However, the 'WC' model code was retained for both the \u200b3\u20444-ton and 1\u200b1\u20442-ton 6x6 Dodges \u2013 as well as for the subsequent model years.\nAll in all, not counting mechanically related variants, the WC series alone involved 52 model versions (thirty \u200b1\u20442\u2011ton 4x4, eight \u200b1\u20442\u2011ton 4x2, twelve \u200b3\u20444\u2011ton 4x4, and two 1\u200b1\u20442\u2011ton 6x6 models).",
  "/wiki/Dodge": "Dodge is an American brand of automobile manufactured by FCA US LLC (formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Group LLC), based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles currently include performance cars, though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth.\n Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the \"Dodge Brothers\" brand in 1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory was located in Hamtramck, Michigan, and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. \n Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made compact cars (such as the 1963\u201376 Dart) and midsize cars (such as the \"B-Body\" Coronet and Charger from 1966\u201378).\n The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan.\n The Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its short-lived merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007, its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management, its 2009 bailout by the United States government, and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat.\n In 2011, Dodge and its model sub-brands, Dodge Ram, and Dodge Viper were separated. Dodge said that the Viper would be an SRT product and Ram will be a standalone marque. In 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, corresponding with the merger of Fiat S.p.A. and Chrysler Group into the single corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.",

About 650,000 units were built, constituting a quarter of the total U.S. non-combat motor vehicles produced during the war, and almost two-thirds of the 988,000 light vehicle class produced, together with the Dodge WC series. Large numbers of jeeps were provided to the U.S.' allies, including Russia at the time \u2014 aside from large amounts of 1\u200b1\u20442- and 2\u200b1\u20442-ton trucks, some 50,000 jeeps and 25,000 \u200b3\u20444-tons were provided to Russia during WW II \u2014 more than Nazi Germany's combined total production of their Volkswagen vehicles, the K\u00fcbelwagen and the Schwimmwagen.\n Author Charles K. Hyde wrote: \"In many respects, the jeep became the iconic vehicle of World War II, with an almost mythological reputation of toughness, durability, and versatility.\"  Not only did it become the workhorse of the American military, as it replaced the use of horses and other draft animals (still heavily used in World War I) in every role, from cavalry units to supply trains, but improvised field modifications also made the jeep capable of just about any other function GIs could think of.\n The jeep was considered such a valuable piece of equipment that General Eisenhower wrote that most senior officers regarded it as \"one of the six most vital\" U.S. vehicles to win the war.[nb 4][failed verification] Moreover, General George Marshall called the squared-off little car \"America's greatest contribution to modern warfare.\"  In 1991, the MB Jeep was designated an \"International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark\" by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n After WWII, the original jeep continued to serve, in the Korean War and other conflicts, until it was updated in the form of the M38 Willys MC and M38A1 Willys MD (in 1949 and 1952 respectively), and received a complete redesign by Ford in the form of the 1960-introduced M151 jeep. Its influence, however, was much greater than that\u2014manufacturers around the world began building jeeps and similar designs, either under license or not\u2014at first primarily for military purposes, but later also for the civilian market. Willys trademarked the \"Jeep\" name, turned the MB into the civilian Jeep CJ models, and Jeep became its own brand. The 1945 Willys Jeep was the world's first mass-produced civilian four-wheel drive car.\n The success of the jeep inspired both an entire category of recreational 4WDs and SUVs, making \"four-wheel drive\" a household term, and numerous incarnations of military light utility vehicles. In 2010, the American Enterprise Institute called the jeep \"one of the most influential designs in automotive history\". Its \"sardine tin on wheels\" silhouette and slotted grille perhaps even more instantly recognizable than the VW Beetle and has evolved into the currently produced Jeep Wrangler long after demise of the original Volkswagen design.",

  "/wiki/Canadian_Military_Pattern_truck": "Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) trucks were a class and a coherent range of military trucks, made in large numbers, and in numerous variants, by Canada during World War II, compliant to British Army specifications, primarily intended for use in the armies of the British Commonwealth allies, but also serving in other units of the British Empire.\n Until the currency restrictions of the late 1940s, the Canadian automotive industry's output provided a major part of British Empire countries vehicles. These territories levied reduced, Imperial preference, duties on Canadian products, usually made by Canadian subsidiaries of the big U.S. auto manufacturers. In the late 1930s, Canada started drawing up standard designs, to prepare for the beginning of the war, which involved a unique and historic design and production collaboration between rival giant car-makers Ford and GM of Canada.\n Canadian Military Pattern trucks not only motorized the militaries of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but were also sent to the Soviet Union following the Nazi invasion, as part of Canada's Gift and Mutual Aid program to the Allies.\n During the War, CMP trucks saw service around the world in the North African Campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Italian Campaign, the Soviet Front, the Burma Campaign, the Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342), the liberation of Northwest Europe, and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. CMP trucks also served in post-war conflicts in Indonesia, French Indochina, and the Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n The United Kingdom's official History of the Second World War called Canada's war-time production of soft-skinned trucks, including the CMP class, the country's most important contribution to Allied victory. Canada's trucks are considered to have \"..put the British Army on wheels\" \u2014 in the North African Campaign, the British Eighth Army fought Rommel using almost exclusively CMP trucks; and the Allied progress from Sicily, through Italy and France, depended heavily on the Canadian trucks. By war's end, Canada's vast supply of trucks provided a vehicle for every three soldiers in the field \n\u2014 compared to one vehicle per seven American GIs, making it the most mobile army in the world.",
  "/wiki/Chevrolet": "Chevrolet (/\u02cc\u0283\u025bvr\u0259\u02c8le\u026a/ SHEV-r\u0259-LAY), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929.\n Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide. In Oceania, Chevrolet is represented by Holden Special Vehicles, having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck (HSV was partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden, which GM is retiring in 2020). In 2005, Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe, primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline \"Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet\", a move rooted in General Motors' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet. With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe, GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand, while GM's traditional European standard-bearers, Opel of Germany, and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket.  However, GM reversed this move in late 2013, announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe, with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette in 2016. Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states, including Russia. After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea, the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet.\n In North America, Chevrolet produces and sells a wide range of vehicles, from subcompact automobiles to medium-duty commercial trucks. Due to the prominence and name recognition of Chevrolet as one of General Motors' global marques, Chevrolet, Chevy or Chev is used at times as a synonym for General Motors or its products, one example being the GM LS1 engine, commonly known by the name or a variant thereof of its progenitor, the Chevrolet small-block engine.",
