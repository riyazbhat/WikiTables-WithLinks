Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax, and capabilities. During its lifetime, several competing products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well.

  "/wiki/IQue_Player": "The iQue Player (/\u02cca\u026a \u02c8kju\u02d0/, stylised as iQue PLAYER) is a home video game console that was manufactured by iQue, a joint venture between Nintendo and Chinese-American scientist Wei Yen after China had made claims of banning video games. The system's Chinese name was Sh\u00e9n Y\u00f3u Ji (\u795e\u6e38\u673a), literally Divine Gaming Machine. Sh\u00e9ny\u00f3u (\u795e\u6e38) serves a double entendre because the term also means to make a mental journey. Although the console was never released in any English-speaking countries, the name iQue Player appears in the console's instruction manual. The console itself takes the form of the controller and plugs directly into the television. A box accessory is available that allows multiplayer gaming. It was only marketed in mainland China, as the console's unusual game distribution method is an attempt to curb game piracy in that region. Games for the iQue Player are stored on a 64 MB flash card which is contained within a cartridge that plugs directly into the controller/console.",

The Game Boy Color is part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.
