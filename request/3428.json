  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.",

  "/wiki/A_unit": "An A unit, in railroad terminology, is a diesel locomotive (or more rarely an electric locomotive) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit, and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position. This terminology is generally used in North America, since only there was it commonplace to build B units\u2014cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train.",
  "/wiki/B_unit": "A B unit, in railroad terminology, is a locomotive unit (generally a diesel locomotive) which does not have a control cab or crew compartment, and must therefore be operated in tandem with another coupled locomotive with a cab (an A unit). The terms booster unit and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, locomotives without driving cabs are rare.",
  "/wiki/EMD_567": "The EMD 567 is a line of large medium-speed diesel engines built by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division. This engine, which succeeded Winton's 201A, was used in EMD's locomotives from 1938 until its replacement in 1966 by the EMD 645. It has a bore of 8\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in (216\u00a0mm), a stroke of 10\u00a0in (254\u00a0mm) and a displacement of 567\u00a0cu\u00a0in (9.29\u00a0L) per cylinder. Like the Winton 201A, the EMD 645 and the EMD 710, the EMD 567 is a two-stroke engine.",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer.

The GP9 succeeded the GP7. The lettering \"GP\" stands for \"general purpose\". This locomotive type was offered both with and without control cabs; locomotives built without control cabs were called GP9B locomotives.",
  "/wiki/EMD_GP15-1": "The EMD GP15-1 is a 4-axle switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between June 1976 and March 1982. Intended to provide an alternative to the rebuilding programs that many railroads were applying to their early road switchers, it is generally employed as a yard switcher or light road switcher. This locomotive is powered by a 12-cylinder EMD 645E engine, which generates 1,500\u00a0hp (1,119\u00a0kW).\nThe GP15-1 uses a 50-foot-9-inch (15.47\u00a0m) frame, has a wheelbase of 29\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (9.07\u00a0m) and has a length over couplers of 54\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (16.74\u00a0m). A total of 310 units were built for American railroads. A number of GP15-1s remain in service today for yard work and light road duty.  The radiator section is similar to those found on the EMD SD40T-2 and EMD SD45T-2 \"tunnel motors,\" leading some observers to incorrectly identify the units as such or as GP15Ts, and giving them the nickname \"baby tunnel motors\".",
  "/wiki/EMD_645": "The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors. While the 645 series was intended primarily for locomotive, marine and stationary engine use, one 16-cylinder version powered the 33-19 \"Titan\" prototype haul truck designed by GM's Terex division.",
  "/wiki/EMD_GP15AC": "An EMD GP15AC is a 4-axle switcher built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between November and December 1982. This locomotive differs from the otherwise identical EMD GP15-1 due to Missouri Pacific specifying new AR10 AC alternators instead of rebuilt D32 DC generators. The only external difference between the GP15AC and the GP15-1 is a straight side sill (shared with the EMD GP15T) not related to the transmission difference.",
