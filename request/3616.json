  "/wiki/Maki-e": "Maki-e (\u8494\u7d75, literally: sprinkled picture) is Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a makizutsu or a kebo brush. The oldest Maki-e in existence now is the ornamentation on the sheath of the Kara-tachi sword with gilded silver fittings and inlay in Togidashi technique held by Sh\u014ds\u014din in Nara, Japan.   Originally the sword was treasured by the Emperor Sh\u014dmu (701 \u2013 June 4, 756)  The technique was developed mainly in the Heian period (794\u20131185) and blossomed in the Edo period (1603\u20131868). Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power.\n To create different colours and textures, maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, aluminum, platinum, and pewter, as well as their alloys. Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines. As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting, young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters. K\u014dami D\u014dch\u014d (1410\u20131478) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works. His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters. K\u014dami and another maki-e master, Igarashi Shinsai, were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan.\n Takamakie (or \"raised maki-e\") is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making. Developed in the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573), the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder, lacquer, and charcoal or clay dust.\n Another special kind of maki-e is togidashi maki-e, where a black lacquer without oil is put on the metal decoration as an additional coat.",

  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana (\u4eee\u540d, Japanese pronunciation: [kana]) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system, contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji (\u6f22\u5b57).

Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana (\u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d), which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana. Hentaigana (\u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d, \"variant kana\") are historical variants of modern standard hiragana. In modern Japanese, hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds.\n Katakana, with a few additions, are also used to write Ainu. \n Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses (furigana) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule.\n Each kana character (syllabogram) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language. Apart from the five vowels, this is always CV (consonant onset with vowel nucleus), such as ka, ki, etc., or V (vowel), such as a, i, etc., with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure has led some scholars to label the system moraic instead of syllabic, because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda (i.e. CVn, CVm, CVng), a CVV syllable with complex nucleus (i.e. multiple or expressively long vowels), or a CCV syllable with complex onset (i.e. including a glide, CyV, CwV).\n Due to the limited number of phonemes in Japanese, as well as the relatively rigid syllable structure, the kana system is a very accurate representation of spoken Japanese.",

They have 13 strings that are usually strung over 13 movable bridges along the width of the instrument.  There is also a 17-string variant.  Players can adjust the string pitches by moving the white bridges before playing.  To play the instrument, the strings are plucked using three finger picks (thumb, index finger, and middle finger).",
  "/wiki/Kasuga-taisha": "Kasuga Grand Shrine (\u6625\u65e5\u5927\u793e, Kasuga-taisha) is a Shinto shrine in Nara, Nara Prefecture, Japan. Established in 768 CE and rebuilt several times over the centuries, it is the shrine of the Fujiwara family.  The interior is famous for its many bronze lanterns, as well as the many stone lanterns that lead up the shrine.\n The architectural style Kasuga-zukuri takes its name from Kasuga Shrine's honden (sanctuary).\n Kasuga Shrine, and the Kasugayama Primeval Forest near it, are registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara\".\n The path to Kasuga Shrine passes through a deer park. In the deer park, deer are able to roam freely and are believed to be sacred messengers of the Shinto gods that inhabit the shrine and surrounding mountainous terrain. Kasuga Shrine and the deer have been featured in several paintings and works of art of the Nambokucho Period.  Over three thousand stone lanterns line the way. The Man'yo Botanical Garden is adjacent to the shrine.",
  "/wiki/Sh\u014d_(instrument)": "The sh\u014d (\u7b19) is a Japanese free reed musical instrument that was introduced from China during the Nara period (AD 710 to 794). It is descended from the Chinese sheng, of the Tang Dynasty era, although the sh\u014d tends to be smaller in size than its contemporary sheng relatives. It consists of 17 slender bamboo pipes, each of which is fitted in its base with a metal free reed. Two of the pipes are silent, although research suggests that they were used in some music during the Heian period.\n The instrument's sound is said to imitate the call of a phoenix, and it is for this reason that the two silent pipes of the sh\u014d are kept\u2014as an aesthetic element, making two symmetrical \"wings\". Similar to the Chinese sheng, the pipes are tuned carefully with a drop of a dense resinous wax preparation containing fine lead shot. As (breath) moisture collected in the sh\u014d's pipes prevents it from sounding, performers can be seen warming the instrument over a small charcoal brazier or electric burner when they are not playing. The instrument produces sound when the player's breath is inhaled or exhaled, allowing long periods of uninterrupted play. The sh\u014d is one of the three primary woodwind instruments used in gagaku, Japan's imperial court music. Its traditional playing technique in gagaku involves the use of tone clusters called aitake (\u5408\u7af9), which move gradually from one to the other, providing accompaniment to the melody.\n A larger size of sh\u014d, called u (derived from the Chinese yu), is little used, although some performers, such as Hiromi Yoshida and Ko Ishikawa, began to revive it in the late 20th century.\n A detailed book in English on the sh\u014d and the gagaku (court orchestra music) it is associated with is titled Music of a Thousand Autumns: The Togaku style of Japanese Court Music by Robert Garfias.",
