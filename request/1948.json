  "/wiki/Pierre_Despr%C3%A8s": "Pierre Despr\u00e8s (or Des Pr\u00e8s, or Des Pr\u00e9s; Lat. de Pratis) (born 1288, at Montpezat-de-Quercy \u2014 died 1361, in Avignon) was a French Cardinal during the period of Avignon Papacy. He was son of Raymond II Despr\u00e8s, seigneur of Montpezat, and Aspasie de Montaigut, the heiress of Bertrand, seigneur de Montaigut.  He had a brother, Raymond, who was ennobled in 1325. Pesserat points out that Montpezat was an important town, being the seat of the Archdeacon of Montpezat  in the diocese of Cahors, who was also Sacristan of the Cathedral. Not at all coincidentally, Pope John XXII was a native of Cahors, and his father had been Sieur de Saint-F\u00e9lix en Quercy.  With his expertise in the law as a teacher and practitioner, and with his experience as a judge in the Roman Curia, Pierre Despr\u00e8s was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Church by John XXII, where he served from 1325 to 1361. He was thus head of the Papal Secretariat, in charge of the drafting of papal bulls and letters,  and a principal papal advisor. The post was also one of the most lucrative in the Roman Curia, since a fee was charged for every document and the Vice-Chancellor received a share of every fee.",
