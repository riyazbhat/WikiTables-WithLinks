The bridge runs nearly 8 kilometres (5 miles) from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The crossing is completed by the 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager. The \u00d6resund Bridge is the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe and connects two major metropolitan areas: Copenhagen, the Danish capital city, and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6. It connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with those of Central and Western Europe. A data cable also makes the bridge the backbone of internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden (and, prior to 2016 also Finland). The international European route E20 crosses via road, the \u00d8resund Line via railway. The construction of the Great Belt Fixed Link (1988-1998), connecting Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula, and the \u00d6resund Bridge have connected Central and Western Europe to Scandinavia by road and rail.",

  "/wiki/Limfjord_Bridge": "Limfjordsbroen is a Danish bridge which connects N\u00f8rresundby and Aalborg over Limfjord, a shallow sound. It was inaugurated 30 March 1933 in the presence of approximately 30,000 spectators and attended by Thorvald Stauning. It was a toll bridge until 1935. The first fixed link between the two cities was established in 1865 in the form of a pontoon bridge, which was in use until the present bridge was established; the original bridge was slow to open and close when ship traffic passed. The bridge was built, without any fatalities, between 1930-33 with 100-200 workers on the construction site. Large sections were built on Aalborg's waterfront west of the bridge's current location. A week before the inauguration, a load test occurred with 48 fully laden trucks placed on the bridge's leaf. A 1960 extension lane increased the bridge's width from 8.5 metres (28 ft) to 12.5 metres (41 ft).",
  "/wiki/Limfjord": "The Limfjord (common Danish: Limfjorden [\u02c8li\u02d0m\u02ccfjo\u02c0\u0250n], in north Jutlandish dialect: \u00c6 Limfjord) is a shallow part of the sea, located in Denmark where it has been regarded as a fjord ever since Viking times. However, it has inlets both from the North Sea and Kattegat, and hence separates the North Jutlandic Island (Danish: N\u00f8rrejyske \u00d8, which includes the old provinces of Vendsyssel, Han herred and Thy) from the rest of the Jutland Peninsula. The Limfjord extends from Thybor\u00f8n Channel on the North Sea to Hals on the Kattegat. It is approximately 180 kilometres (111 miles) long and of an irregular shape with numerous bays, narrowings, and islands, most notably Mors, and the smaller ones Fur, Ven\u00f8, Jegind\u00f8, Egholm and Liv\u00f8. It is deepest at Hvalpsund (24 metres).  \n Its main port is Aalborg, where a railway bridge (Jernbanebroen over Limfjorden) and road bridge (Limfjordsbroen) have been built across the Limfjord to N\u00f8rresundby, while motorway E45 crosses it through a tunnel to the east. Commercial ports also exist at Thisted, Nyk\u00f8bing Mors, Skive, L\u00f8gst\u00f8r, Struer, Lemvig and Thybor\u00f8n.

  "/wiki/North_Jutlandic_Island": "The North Jutlandic Island (Danish: N\u00f8rrejyske \u00d8), Vendsyssel-Thy, or simply Jutland north of the Limfjord (Jylland nord for Limfjorden) are lesser-used names for the northernmost part of Denmark and of Jutland. It is more common to refer to the three traditional districts Vendsyssel, Hanherred and Thy. The area was not surrounded by water until a storm in February 1825, which caused a connection between the North Sea and the fjord Limfjorden. Hence it is traditionally regarded as a part of Jutland rather than an island. Geographically, it is the second largest island of Denmark after Zealand (excluding Greenland) with a population of 296,700 on 1 January 2014. Danes rarely refer to the area as a whole, but more often to the three constituent districts or to North Jutland (which also includes an area south of the Limfjord). The adjectives nordenfjords and s\u00f8ndenfjords are commonly used, meaning north and south of the Fjord, respectively. The names can all be considered ad hoc creations, as a traditional name for the island as a geographical unity is lacking.",
