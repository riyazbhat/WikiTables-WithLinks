Together with Basel (Bank for International Settlements), Geneva (United Nations headquarters in Europe) and New York City (United Nations world headquarters), Strasbourg is among the few cities in the world not being a state capital and hosting international organisations of the first order. The city is the seat of many non-European international institutions such as the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine and the International Institute of Human Rights.",
