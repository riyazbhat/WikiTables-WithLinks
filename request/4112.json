  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_(historical)": "The Conservative Party of Canada has gone by a variety of names over the years since Canadian Confederation. Initially known as the Liberal-Conservative Party, it dropped Liberal from its name in 1873, although many of its candidates continued to use this name. As a result of World War I and the Conscription Crisis of 1917, the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the Unionist Party, led by Robert Borden from 1917 to 1920, and then the National Liberal and Conservative Party until 1922. It then reverted to Liberal-Conservative Party until 1938, when it became simply the National Conservative Party. It ran in the 1940 election as National Government even though it was in opposition. The party was almost always referred to as simply the Conservative Party or Tories.",

  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army (USA) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces. It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services, and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution. As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) - before the United States of America was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775. As a uniformed military service, the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army, which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant, the secretary of the Army (SECARMY) and by a chief military officer, the chief of staff of the Army (CSA) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is the largest military branch, and in the fiscal year 2017, the projected end strength for the Regular Army (USA) was 476,000 soldiers; the Army National Guard (ARNG) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) had 199,000 soldiers; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers. As a branch of the armed forces, the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation's wars, by providing prompt, sustained land dominance, across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict, in support of combatant commanders. The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States.",

  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada (French: Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada. The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history, holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's natural governing party. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), occupying the centre-left to left. Like their federal Conservative Party rivals, the party is often described as a big tent, attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre. The Liberals' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and reproductive choice. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election, winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons.

  "/wiki/Yale_(electoral_district)": "Yale was a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1872 to 1892 and from 1917 to 1953. It first appeared when the original Yale District riding, which was created and filled by special byelection in 1871 at the time of BC's entry into the Canadian Confederation, was abolished and replaced by Yale riding. Yale riding spanned both Yale and Kootenay Land Districts, that is to say, the entirety of the southern province from the Fraser Canyon to the Rockies. It was last used in the 1891 election, and was merged in 1892 with the Cariboo riding to form Yale - Cariboo. That arrangement lasted until 1914 when a further redistribution separated Yale and Cariboo once again. This second incarnation was considerably smaller than the first because Kootenay district was now in a different riding. In 1903, the riding of Kootenay was split off from what had been the original Yale riding. The new Yale riding excluded the Town of Yale, and when it was reconstituted, coincided with the provincial Okanagan riding except for the city of Salmon Arm. The new incarnation of Yale lasted until the 1952, when the Yale name vanished from the Commons and the Okanagan ridings, Okanagan Boundary and Okanagan - Revelstoke were created. The old core area around the town of historic and once-important Yale, which has long since became depopulated by being bypassed by massive growth elsewhere, was attached to the Fraser Valley riding, then to its successor Fraser Valley East, and then to today's Chilliwack - Fraser Canyon. It was not in the second incarnation of the Yale riding when it was reconstituted in 1914.",
  "/wiki/John_Horace_Dickey": "John Horace Dickey (4 September 1914 - 27 April 1996) was a Liberal party member of the House of Commons of Canada. He was a barrister, executive and lawyer by career. He was first elected to Parliament at the Halifax riding in a by-election on 14 July 1947 which was called after the death of William Chisholm MacDonald, one of the riding's Liberal incumbents. Since Halifax riding elected two members to the House of Commons at that time, Dickey joined the other incumbent, fellow Liberal Gordon Benjamin Isnor. Both Dickey and Isnor were re-elected in the 1949 election. Isnore was appointed to the Senate in May 1950 and was joined by another Liberal, Samuel Rosborough Balcom, following a by-election the following month. Both Dickey and Balcom were re-elected to a full term in Parliament in the 1953 election, but were defeated in the 1957 federal election by the two Progressive Conservative party candidates Robert McCleave and Edmund L. Morris. In the 1958 election, Dickey was joined by Leonard Kitz in an unsuccessful attempt to win back the riding for the Liberals. Dickey died in 1996 aged 81.",

Between 1930 and 1979, he was the only Progressive Conservative (PC or Tory) leader to lead the party to an election victory, doing so three times, although only once with a majority of seats in the House of Commons of Canada. Diefenbaker was born in southwestern Ontario in the small town of Neustadt in 1895. In 1903, his family migrated west to the portion of the North-West Territories which would soon become the province of Saskatchewan. He grew up in the province and was interested in politics from a young age. After brief service in World War I, Diefenbaker became a noted criminal defence lawyer. He contested elections through the 1920s and 1930s with little success until he was finally elected to the House of Commons in 1940. Diefenbaker was repeatedly a candidate for the PC leadership. He gained that party position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the Tories to their first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a snap election and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his Cabinet, as well as the first aboriginal member of the Senate.
