  "/wiki/Ross\u00f8ya": "Ross\u00f8ya, sometimes referred to as Ross Island in English, is an island located in the Arctic Ocean. It is a part of Sju\u00f8yane, a group of islands in the Svalbard archipelago, some 20 km north of the coast of Nordaustlandet, Svalbard in Arctic Norway. Ross\u00f8ya is located 100 m north-northwest of the somewhat larger island Vesle Tavle\u00f8ya. The northern point of Ross\u00f8ya, at 80\u00b0 49\u2032 44.41\u2033 North, is the northernmost point in Svalbard, and thereby also in the Kingdom of Norway. The distance to the North Pole is 1024.3 kilometers (637 mi / 553 nm), to Nordkapp on the Norwegian mainland 1084 km and to Pysen, off the southern tip of mainland Norway, 2580 km. Some sources describe Ross\u00f8ya as the northernmost point of Europe, but this requires that Franz Josef Land be considered part of Asia, since Cape Fligely on Rudolf Island, Russia, is located at 81\u00b0 48\u2032 24\u2033 North, which is 109 km closer to the North Pole. The island is named after James Clark Ross (1800\u20131862), a British explorer who was part of William Edward Parry's 1827 expedition with HMS Hecla to reach the North Pole. After passing by Sju\u00f8yane and Ross\u00f8ya, the expedition was forced to give up, after getting stuck in the ice.",
  "/wiki/Svalbard": "The name Svalbard comes from an older native name for the archipelago, Svalbar\u00f0, composed of the well-attested Old Norse words svalr (cold) and bar\u00f0 (edge; ridge). The name Spitsbergen originated with Dutch navigator and explorer Willem Barentsz, who described the pointed mountains or, in Dutch, spitse bergen that he saw on the west coast of the main island, Spitsbergen. Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago, and consequently the name Spitsbergen long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole.",

Known among Russians in the Middle Ages as the Murman Sea (Norwegian Sea), the current name of the sea is after the historical Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz.\n This is a rather shallow shelf sea, with an average depth of 230 metres (750 ft), and it is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration.  The Barents Sea is bordered by the Kola Peninsula to the south, the shelf edge towards the Norwegian Sea to the west, and the archipelagos of Svalbard to the northwest, Franz Josef Land to the northeast and Novaya Zemlya to the east. The islands of Novaya Zemlya, an extension of the northern end of the Ural Mountains, separate the Barents Sea from the Kara Sea.\n Although part of the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea has been characterised as turning into the Atlantic because of its status as the Arctic warming hot spot. Hydrologic changes due to global warming have led to a reduction in sea ice and in stratification of the water column, which could produce major changes in weather in Eurasia.",
