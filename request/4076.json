A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia.  He was the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a turncoat, as the Party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the National Government coalition that Snowden supported.

  "/wiki/George_Lansbury": "George Lansbury (21 February 1859 \u2013 7 May 1940) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party  from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929\u201331, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women's rights and world disarmament.\n Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury became a socialist in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to Parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action.\n In 1912, Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to Parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in  the Poplar \"rates revolt\" of 1921.\n After his return to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929\u201331. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.",

He moved to Glasgow to find employment shortly before his father's death, and his younger siblings then moved in with him.\n Highly religious in his youth, Kessack became a socialist after hearing Robert Smillie speak at the 1901 North East Lanarkshire by-election.  Sam MacDonald of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) noticed Kessack's speaking ability and persuaded him to join, and Kessack later joined the Socialist Labour Party, Industrial Workers of the World and then was a founder member of the Advocates of Industrial Unionism.  He resigned from the SLP after the party forbade members from speaking at meetings of any other group, but remained prominent in the ILP, and the group sponsored his unsuccessful candidatures for the Labour Party at both the January and December 1910 general elections in Glasgow Camlachie.\n Kessack became the national organiser of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) in 1909, replacing James Larkin.  Although during his first couple of years, membership of the union fell in Scotland, he managed to recruit large numbers of new members in the Humber ports, and was regarded as a successful figure.  However, he left his post in 1914 to join the Scottish Horse regiment of the British Army.  He was promoted to become a captain, but was killed in the Battle of the Ancre in November 1916.",

  "/wiki/William_Crawford_Anderson": "William Crawford Anderson (1877 \u2013 25 February 1919) was a British socialist politician.\n Born on 13 February 1877 at Findon, Aberdeenshire, the name Crawford in fact does not appear on his birth certificate. His father Francis Anderson was a blacksmith, who married in 1868, Barbara Cruickshank, an ardent radical; she being responsible for Anderson\u2019s education, she was an intelligent and widely read woman of strong, radical, Presbyterian views who encouraged William to read extensively. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed in Aberdeen as a manufacturing chemist and began to attend meetings of the local Social Democratic Federation (SDF), at this time he also followed Tom Mann\u2019s campaign for the by-election in 1896.\n After listening to an eloquent speech by Carrie Martyn at an SDF meeting, he became intent on improving himself and began to read rigorously; he read everything from Dickens, Ruskin, Thackeray and Hardy, to name but a few. Robert Blatchford\u2019s Merrie England had a profound effect upon Anderson although he did not at this point consider himself to be a socialist, but advocated Land Nationalism.\n The most influential figure in his transition to Socialism was A. E. Fletcher, the editor of The New Age. Fletcher was running in the Glasgow elections supported by the Independent Labour Party (ILP). In 1900 Anderson moved to Glasgow and volunteered to help Fletcher in the election; he in turn joined the Glasgow branch of the ILP and also the Shop Assistants Union, then moved to the Manufacturing Chemists. The transition from radical to socialist politics was completed after Anderson's move to Glasgow, where he contested the Camlachie seat in the 1900 khaki election on a pro-Boer platform, supported by the ILP. He was elected chairman of the Union after just three months. In 1902 he was the delegate of the ILP to the Manchester Conference. By 1903 he had become an organiser and official of the union with the aim of strengthening local branches and creating new ones, and was a major figure in the vigorous campaign of 1907 to improve the conditions of shop managers, before he left the union that year. In the same year he attended his first ILP conference and reinforced his reputation as a public speaker; he addressed audiences on a number of subjects ranging from Tariff reform, National Service, and key political issues. During his many addresses it is rumoured he was forced to do an encore by the audience, so he repeated part of his speech again. Still only in his early thirties, he was one of the best known leaders of the ILP. To reinforce this, he was elected to the National Administration Council of the ILP in 1908. His aim was to avoid a particular faction. It was noted in 1910 by Fenner Brockway, whom Anderson influenced to take the job of editor of the Labour Leader, that Anderson was an \u2019influential member of the NAC, who stood midway between Snowden and MacDonald in their quarrels. He wanted to work with the Labour Party to smooth suspicions with which it regarded the ILP.\u2019\n In 1910 he was elected chair of the ILP, a position he held until 1913. In September 1911 he was appointed to the Chair of the committee to set up a new Labour newspaper, which became the Daily Citizen. He acted as the Vice Chairman and leader writer. The paper was launched in 1912 but never flourished; Anderson left before it failed.\n In 1913 he was the speaker for the special conference on the Public Transport Strike and in 1914 was a supporter of the Anti-War stance. The National Council of the ILP met to formulate a manifesto; Anderson read a draft which the council chose above Hardie's or Glasier's. Finally in 1914 on his third attempt he entered parliament; however he lost his seat in 1918 due to his opposition to war.\n In 1919 he caught a chill which developed into influenza and he died not long after. He was cremated at Golders Green. Anderson was survived by his wife, the trade unionist and women's rights campaigner Mary Macarthur (whom he married in 1911; she d. 1921) and his daughter Nancy.\n Scottish socialist politician Glasier\u2019s opinion of him was: \n\u2018Most naturally gifted parliamentarian born front bench, and maybe Prime Minister.

  "/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald": "James Ramsay MacDonald FRS (n\u00e9 James McDonald Ramsay; 12 October 1866 \u2013 9 November 1937) was a British statesman who was the first Labour Party politician to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, leading minority Labour governments for nine months in 1924 and then in 1929\u201331. From 1931 to 1935, he headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party and supported by only a few Labour members. MacDonald was later vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found.\n MacDonald, along with Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party. He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and, after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War, he was Leader of the Labour Party from 1922. The second Labour Government (1929\u201331) was dominated by the Great Depression. He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the gold standard, but it had to be abandoned after the Invergordon Mutiny, and he called a general election in 1931 seeking a \"doctor's mandate\" to fix the economy. The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons. His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935, remaining as Lord President of the Council until retiring in 1937. He died later that year.\n MacDonald's speeches, pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician. Historian John Shepherd states that \"MacDonald's natural gifts of an imposing presence, handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader\". After 1931, MacDonald was repeatedly and bitterly denounced by the Labour movement as a traitor to its cause. Since the 1960s, historians have defended his reputation, emphasising his earlier role in building up the Labour Party, dealing with the Great Depression, and as a putative forerunner of the political realignments of the 1990s and 2000s.",

He first became prominent as a left-wing member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP); at its 1906 conference, he was the lead opponent of a motion against military service, holding that such training would assist with building a citizen's army.\n During 1908, McLachlan supported Victor Grayson's independent \"Right to Work\" candidates for Manchester City Council, and also campaigned for Dan Irving of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) at the 1908 Manchester North West by-election.  McLachlan himself stood in Ardwick for the city council in Ardwick in 1909, and was elected.  Despite this, it was a surprise when he was adopted as the official Labour Party candidate for Manchester South West at the January 1910 general election.  He took only 16.6% of the vote, and was not elected.\n McLachlan was elected to the National Administrative Council (NAC) of the ILP in 1909, along with other left-wingers, including Leonard Hall and Russell Smart.  Concerned about the direction of the Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald and the ILP's role in this, McLachlan compiled a document entitled Let us reform the Labour Party, but generally known as the Green Manifesto, with contributions from co-thinkers including Hall, C. T. Douthwaite and J. H. Belcher.\n In 1911, the SDF formed the new British Socialist Party, hoping that dissidents on the left of the ILP would join.  Although Douthwaite left to join the new party, McLachlan opted to remain in the ILP and work with G. H. Stuart on the NAC.  They formed part of a broader left including George Lansbury and Keir Hardie, but the resignations of Lansbury and Hardie from the council in 1912 left them isolated.\n By 1919, McLachlan was suffering with poor health, and resigned his seat on the council; R.

  "/wiki/Keir_Hardie": "James Keir Hardie (15 August 1856 \u2013 26 September 1915) was a Scottish trade unionist and politician. He was a founder of the Labour Party, and served as its first parliamentary leader from 1906 to 1908.\n Hardie was born in Newhouse, North Lanarkshire. He started working at the age of seven, and from the age of 10 worked in the South Lanarkshire coal mines. With a background in preaching, he became known as a talented public speaker and was chosen as a spokesman for his fellow miners. In 1879, Hardie was elected leader of a miners' union in Hamilton and organised a National Conference of Miners in Dunfermline. He subsequently led miners' strikes in Lanarkshire (1880) and Ayrshire (1881). He turned to journalism to make ends meet, and from 1886 was a full-time union organiser as secretary of the Ayrshire Miners' Union.\n Hardie initially supported William Gladstone's Liberal Party, but later concluded that the working class needed its own party. He first stood for parliament in 1888 as an independent, and later that year helped form the Scottish Labour Party. Hardie won the English seat of West Ham South as an independent candidate in 1892, and helped to form the Independent Labour Party (ILP) the following year. He lost his seat in 1895, but was re-elected to parliament in 1900 for Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. In the same year he helped to form the union-based Labour Representation Committee, which was later renamed the Labour Party.\n After the 1906 election, Hardie was chosen as the Labour Party's first parliamentary leader. He resigned in 1908 in favour of Arthur Henderson, and spent his remaining years campaigning for specific causes, such as women's suffrage, self-rule for India, and opposition to World War I. He died in 1915 while attempting to organise a pacifist general strike. Hardie is seen as a key figure in the history of the Labour Party and has been the subject of multiple biographies. Kenneth O.

He became interested in ethical socialism and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), serving on its national council, though never becoming a figure well-known to the public.\n Williams stood as the Labour Representation Committee candidate for Huddersfield at the 1906 general election.  He was initially selected by the local trades council, and only later gained the backing of the ILP, against the private wishes of Ramsay MacDonald.  He believed that he had a strong chance of winning the seat, but ultimately took a close second place, with 35.2% of the vote, on an extremely high turnout of 94% of eligible voters.\n Williams stood again at the 1906 Huddersfield by-election, for the renamed Labour Party, but again lost narrowly, his vote dropping slightly to 33.8%.  Although blaming this on the disqualification of some working class voters, he also admitted that the party had failed to make new converts.\n Williams lost further favour with the ILP leadership after he endorsed Victor Grayson in his successful independent labour campaign at the 1907 Colne Valley by-election.
