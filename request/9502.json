Consonants are written horizontally from left to right, with vowels arranged above, below, to the left, or to the right of the corresponding consonant, or in a combination of positions.\n Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system (Thai: \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22, lek thai), but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals (Thai: \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01, lek hindu arabik) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles.",

Long pepper has a taste similar to, but hotter than, that of its close relative Piper nigrum \u2013 from which black, green and white pepper are obtained.\n The fruit of the pepper consists of many minuscule fruits \u2013 each about the size of a poppy seed \u2013 embedded in the surface of a flower spike that closely resembles a hazel tree catkin. Like Piper nigrum, the fruits contain the alkaloid piperine, which contributes to their pungency. Another species of long pepper, Piper retrofractum, is native to Java, Indonesia. The fruits of this plant are often confused with chili peppers, which belong to the genus Capsicum, originally from the Americas.",

Red flowers with 5 petals appear in the spring before the new foliage.  It produces a capsule which, when ripe, contains white fibres like cotton.  Its trunk bears spikes to deter attacks by animals.  Although its stout trunk suggests that it is useful for timber, its wood is too soft to be very useful.",

It is also a commercial source of an essential oil and nutmeg butter. The California nutmeg, Torreya californica, has a seed of similar appearance, but is not closely related to Myristica fragrans, and is not used as a spice. If consumed in amounts exceeding its typical use as a spice, nutmeg powder may produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, or have psychoactive effects.

It has a unique aroma and flavor that is neither hot like chili peppers nor pungent like black pepper. Instead, it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth due to hydroxy-\u03b1-sanshool. It is commonly used in Sichuanese dishes such as mapo doufu and Chongqing hot pot, and is often added together with chili peppers to create a flavor known in Mandarin as m\u00e1l\u00e0 (\u9ebb\u8fa3; \"numb-spiciness\").\n Despite its name, Sichuan pepper is not closely related to either black pepper or the chili pepper. It comes from the seeds of at least two species of small trees in the global genus Zanthoxylum (colloquially known as \"prickly ash\") in the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and rue. The husk or hull (pericarp) around the seeds may be used whole, especially in Sichuan cuisine, and the finely ground powder is one of the ingredients for five-spice powder.

World production in 2016 was 6.1 million tonnes, with Tanzania, Myanmar, India, and Sudan as the largest producers.\n Sesame seed is one of the oldest oilseed crops known, domesticated well over 3000 years ago. Sesamum has many other species, most being wild and native to sub-Saharan Africa. S. indicum, the cultivated type, originated in India and is tolerant to drought-like conditions, growing where other crops fail.\n Sesame has one of the highest oil contents of any seed.

The Pali chronicles refer to the kingdom as Yonara\u1e6d\u1e6dha or Yonkara\u1e6d\u1e6dha (Kingdom of the Yuon) or Bingara\u1e6d\u1e6dha (Kingdom of the Mae Ping). In the Chinese History of the Yuan it is called Babai Xifu (Pa-pai-si-fu) (Chinese: \u516b\u767e\u5ab3\u5987), mentioned first in 1292.\n The cultural development of the Northern Thai people had begun long before as successive kingdoms preceded Lan Na. As a continuation of the kingdom of Ngoenyang, Lan Na emerged strong enough in the 15th century to rival the Ayutthaya Kingdom, with whom wars were fought. However, the Lanna Kingdom was weakened and became a tributary state of the Taungoo Dynasty in 1558. Lan Na was ruled by successive vassal kings, though some enjoyed autonomy. The Burmese rule gradually withdrew but then resumed as the new Konbaung Dynasty expanded its influence. In 1775, Lan Na chiefs left the Burmese control to join Siam, leading to the Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376). Following the retreat of the Burmese force, the Burmese control over Lan Na came to the end. Siam, under King Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom gained control of Lan Na in 1776. The kings of Lan Na states remained faithful to the Chakri Dynasty of Siam who provided them with protection against Burma. By 1909, Lanna Kingdom no longer existed formally as Siam finalized the demarcation of its borders with the British and French; Lanna Kingdom was then recognized as a part of Thailand and not as an independent entity. Furthermore, Thai nation-building saw to it that Lanna Kingdom came under direct control of Bangkok through a growing bureaucracy and more formal ties to the capital in the late 19th century.",
