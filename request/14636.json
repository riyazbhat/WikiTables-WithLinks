  "/wiki/Baseball_Bugs": "Baseball Bugs is a 1946 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes theatrical animated cartoon starring Bugs Bunny which was originally released on February 2, 1946.

  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character, created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros. Cartoons) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc. Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky's Hare Hunt (1938) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts, the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare (1940). Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catch phrase \"Eh...What's up, doc?\". Due to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment, but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world. He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos. Since his debut, Bugs has appeared in various short films, feature films, compilations, TV series, music records, comics, video games, award shows, amusement park rides, and commercials.",

The senior director at Warners' Termite Terrace studio, Freleng directed more cartoons than any other director in the studio (a total of 266), and is also the most honored of the Warner directors, having won five Academy Awards and three Emmy Awards[disputed  \u2013 discuss]. After Warners closed down the animation studio in 1963, Freleng and business partner David H. DePatie founded DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises, which produced cartoons (including The Pink Panther Show), feature film title sequences, and Saturday-morning cartoons through the early 1980s.\n The nickname \"Friz\" came from his friend, Hugh Harman, who initially nicknamed him \"Congressman Frizby\" after a fictional senator who appeared in satirical pieces in the Los Angeles Examiner. Over time, this shortened to \"Friz\".",

Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character.

His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a \"scwewy wabbit\". Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \"Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\", as well as his trademark laughter. The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones' work What's Opera, Doc?

In each episode, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) to try to catch his prey, which backfire comically, with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme. One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff. After he goes over the edge, the rest of the scene, shot from a bird's-eye view, shows him falling into a canyon so deep, that his figure is eventually lost to sight. This is followed, a second or two later, by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits. Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name.",
