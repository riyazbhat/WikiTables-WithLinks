  "/wiki/White-faced_saki": "The white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), called the Guianan saki and the golden-faced saki, is a species of the New World saki monkey. They can be found in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela. This species lives in the understory and lower canopy of the forest, feeding mostly on fruits, nuts, seeds, humans, and insects. Although they are arboreal creatures and are specialists of swinging from tree to tree (brachiation), they are also terrestrial when foraging. White-faced sakis typically live around 14 years in their natural habitat and have been recorded to live up to 36 years in captivity. Sakis are active in the day and sleep highly elevated (15-20m) in trees with many leaves to shelter them from weather and flying predators.",

  "/wiki/Monk_saki": "The monk saki (Pithecia monachus) also known as Geoffroy's monk saki or Miller's monk saki, is a species of saki monkey, a type of New World monkey, from South America. It is found in forested areas of northwestern Brazil, northeastern Peru, eastern Ecuador and southeastern Colombia. This monkey can grow up to be 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20\u00a0in) long and weigh about 1 to 2 kilograms (2\u00a0lb 3\u00a0oz to 4\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz), approximately the same as a large rabbit. The thick, bushy tail can be up to 25 to 55 centimetres (10 to 22\u00a0in) long. It has coarse fur, which is long and shaggy around the face and neck. A shy, wary animal, it is totally arboreal, living high in the trees and sometimes descending to lower levels but not to the ground. It generally moves on all fours but may sometimes walk upright on a large branch and will leap across gaps. During the day, it moves in pairs or small family groups, feeding on fruits, berries, honey, some leaves, small mammals such as mice and bats, and birds. The female gives birth to 1 young per mating season with the average family size being 4.5.",
  "/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire": "\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (15 April 1772\u00a0\u2013 19 June 1844) was a French naturalist who established the principle of \"unity of composition\".  He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck's evolutionary theories.  Geoffroy's scientific views had a transcendental flavor (unlike Lamarck's materialistic views) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken. He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time, amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology.",
