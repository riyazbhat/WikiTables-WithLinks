  "/wiki/Westar_1": "Westar 1 was America's first domestic and commercially launched geostationary communications satellite, launched by Western Union (WU) and NASA on April 13, 1974.  It was built by Hughes for Western Union, using the HS-333 platform of spin-stabilized satellites.  Westar 1 was the first of five Westar satellites launched by Western Union from 1974 to 1982.  Westars 1, 2, and 3 were 12-transponder satellites while Westar 4 and Westar 5 were launched with 24 transponders.  Western Union built a teleport in Cedar Hill, Texas, to uplink content to the Westar satellites (it was interconnected to WU's existing terrestrial microwave network  at the time), and another teleport that, in addition to uplink services, would become the main TT&C (telemetry, tracking & control) center for the satellite (and for all of the Westar fleet later on), in Glenwood, New Jersey.  A sixth satellite, Westar 6, was launched in 1984 but failed to reach orbit and was retrieved by the STS-51-A Space Shuttle mission later that year.  It was later refurbished and relaunched in orbit of Asia as AsiaSat 1 in 1990.",
