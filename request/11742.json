  "/wiki/Fort_de_Cormeilles-en-Parisis": "The Fort de Cormeilles-en-Parisis was constructed between 1874 and 1877 as part of a new plan for the defense of Paris developed by General Raymond Adolphe S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res, near the town of Cormeilles-en-Parisis. During the Franco-Prussian War, German troops had used the hill upon which the fort sits as a spotting and firing location, ideal for the siting of new rifled guns whose range was increased over old-fashioned smooth-bore guns. These weapons could attack Paris from Cormeilles, so a new outer ring of forts had to be built outside the first ring of forts built in 1840-1860 to deny the area to enemy gunners. The S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system was designed as a response to these technological innovations, and to the loss of French territories in Alsace and Lorraine.",

It was built between 1875 and 1879 in accordance with improved principles of fortification developed for the S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system. Work on the fort began in 1874 and were completed in 1878. The fort covered an area of 12 hectares (30 acres) and its garrison comprised 1175 men and officers. The fort's artillery fire supported its neighbors, the Fort de Montmorency and the Fort de Montlignon. The pentagonal fort was entered through the south side, facing Paris. It featured a double caponier on the point facing outward, and two flanking caponiers on the east and west sides. The fort's main armament was a 155mm Mougin turret, added in 1884. Other artillery on the firing terrace, or cavalier, was of 120mm and 95mm caliber. The fort's artillery dominated the plains to the north, as well as the railway line to Pontoise. On 3 and 4 September 1914, the fort fired on German scout parties in the vicinity of Luzarches, the only Parisian fortification to fire on Germans during World War I.",

The fort saw no action in the first or second world wars, but its prominent height made it ideal for use as a telecommunications relay station. In 1947 the French Air Force occupied the site, and by 1952 communication cables were installed to link the fort to the national air defense communications system. In 1956 the Fort de Montmorency became the national headquarters for Air Force communications. The fort was designated Base aerienne 285. Base aerienne 285 was disbanded in 1968 and the fort was first placed under the jurisdiction of ''Base aerienne 104 at Le Bourget, and later under the control of the French Air Force hardened command center at Base aerienne 921 at Taverny, at the west end of the Montmorency forest. From 1992 the fort has served as a training center for security forces associated with the Taverny center, the Centre d'Initiation aux Techniques Commandos.

The Fort de Villiers was built between 1878 and 1880 at an elevation of 111 meters, overlooking the Marne to the north and a rail line to the south, and was intended to deny the use of the height to an enemy. The fort was originally armed with eighteen long-range guns, ten smaller guns for the caponiers, and three mortars. Pre-surveyed fields of fire covered the neighboring Fort de Champigny at 3500m and the Fort de Chelles, 6200m away. The fort received 75mm anti-aircraft guns in 1915. The Fort de Villiers was the property of the Ministry of Defense until July 2001, when it was transferred to the community of Noisy-le-Grand, one of a series of new towns constructed around Paris. The fort covers seven hectares on the south side of A4 autoroute. It is linked to the town center of Noisy-le-Grand by a bridge over the autoroute.
