  "/wiki/Opera_semiseria": "Opera semiseria ('semi-serious opera') is an Italian genre of opera, popular in the early and middle 19th century. Related to the opera buffa, opera semiseria contains elements of comedy but also of pathos, sometimes with a pastoral setting. It can usually be distinguished from tragic operas or melodramas by the presence of a basso buffo. One of the better-known examples is Gaetano Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix. Another example is Gioacchino Rossini's La gazza ladra. Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula has all the characteristics of the genre except the presence of the required basso buffo and is regarded as both opera seria and opera semiseria.",

Behind the libretto stand many Italian, ultimately Renaissance sources created by Matteo Bandello, and probably through their French translations by Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest and Pierre Boaistuau, rather than Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet. The theme was very popular in Italy: there were earlier libretti by Luzzi for Luigi Marescalchi (1785, Venice), Foppa for Niccol\u00f2 Antonio Zingarelli (1796, Milan), and Buonaiuti for Pietro Carlo Guglielmi (1810, London). The first Italian libretto explicitly based on Shakespeare\u2019s play did not appear until 1865; it was by M. M. Marcello, for Filippo Marchetti\u2019s Romeo e Giulietta given in Trieste. Bellini was persuaded to write the opera for the 1830 Carnival season at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, with only a month and a half available for composition.

After he and Giuditta Pasta (for whom the opera was to be written) had together seen the ballet based on the very different play, Tedaldi-Fores' Beatrice Tenda, in Milan in October 1832, she became enthusiastic about the subject and the composer set about persuading Romani that this was a good idea.

Against his better judgment, he finally agreed, although he failed to provide verses for many months. Although unsuccessful at its premiere in Venice in 1833, Bellini felt that he had counteracted the horror of its story by means of the music, colouring it now tremendously and now sadly.

  "/wiki/Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien": "Com\u00e9die-Italienne or Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien are French names which have been used to refer to Italian-language theatre and opera when performed in France. The earliest recorded visits by Italian players were commedia dell'arte companies employed by the French court under the Italian-born queens Catherine de Medici and Marie de Medici. These troupes also gave public performances in Paris at the theatre of the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, probably the earliest public theatre to be built in France. The first official use of the name Com\u00e9die-Italienne was in 1680, when it was given to the commedia dell'arte troupe at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, to distinguish it from the French troupe, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, which was founded that year, and just as the name Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais was commonly applied to the latter, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien was used for the Italians. Over time French phrases, songs, whole scenes, and eventually entire plays were incorporated into the Com\u00e9die-Italienne's performances. By 1762 the company was merged with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, but the names Com\u00e9die-Italienne and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien continued to be used, even though the repertory soon became almost exclusively French op\u00e9ra-comique. The names were dropped completely in 1801, when the company was merged with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau. From 1801 to 1878, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien was used for a succession of Parisian opera companies performing Italian opera in Italian."
