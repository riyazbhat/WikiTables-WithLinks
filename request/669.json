The musical had run for many years on the stage in both NYC and London. Audrey Hepburn, the female lead of the film, was controversially not nominated for Best Actress. The unpopularity of her replacing Julie Andrews - who had originated the role on Broadway and, coincidentally, the Best Actress winner of the year for Mary Poppins - as well as the revelation that the majority of her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon (which wasn't approved by Hepburn herself) were seen as the main reasons for the snub. The ceremony was produced by MGM's Joe Pasternak and hosted, for the 14th time, by Bob Hope. The awards show was a star-studded one, including an appearance by Judy Garland, who sang a medley of Cole Porter songs in tribute to the composer, who had died in October 1964. This event marked the first time that more than two films had received ten or more nominations (repeated at the 50th and 92nd Academy Awards), and the only time in Oscar history that three films got twelve or more nominations: Becket and My Fair Lady each received twelve, while Mary Poppins received thirteen.

  "/wiki/A_Brighter_Summer_Day": "A Brighter Summer Day is a 1991 Taiwanese epic coming-of-age drama film directed by Edward Yang and is considered by most to be a masterpiece of contemporary cinema. The film is an extraordinarily large project for a Chinese-language film, not only for its duration of almost four hours, but also for its involvement of more than 100 amateur actors in different roles. The English title is derived from the lyrics of Elvis Presley's Are You Lonesome Tonight?. The film was selected as the Taiwanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards but was not nominated. The film addresses a great array of human-centred themes such as the eager search for guidance during adolescence, the angst resulting from social detachment, the everyday hardships of parenthood, the pursuit of a satisfying individual and collective identity together with the ennui and frustration prompted by failing to do so, the volatility of young love and friendships, the self-aggrandising tendencies commonplace in teenage-made myths, and, especially, the fatal and irreversible consequences of an aimless life and a bewildering upbringing. Edward Yang also tackles highly sensitive political issues like the rise of Western culture to the detriment of Taiwan's traditions, the wide-spreading of unrest and violence stirred by socio-political uneasiness, the strained coexistence among social classes trying to deal with an uncertain future, the consequent yearn of migrating towards an expectedly-better country, and the proliferation of self-ruled quasi-political organisations (in this case, youth gangs) as a way to substitute an unconvincing State.",

  "/wiki/Ang_Lee": "Ang Lee OBS (Chinese: \u674e\u5b89; pinyin: L\u01d0 \u0100n; born 23 October 1954) is a Taiwanese filmmaker. Born in the Pingtung County of southern Taiwan, Lee was educated in Taiwan and later in the United States for further study. His filmmaking career has seen him experience international critical and popular acclaim and a range of accolades. Lee garnered success with Pushing Hands (1991), The Wedding Banquet (1993), and Eat Drink Man Woman (1994), which explored the relationships and conflicts between tradition and modernity, Eastern and Western; the three films are informally known as the Father Knows Best trilogy. The films garnered Lee success both in his native Taiwan and internationally, precipitating his arrival in Hollywood with Sense and Sensibility (1995), for which he received critical praise and a number of accolades. He went on to direct films in a broad range of genres, including the drama The Ice Storm (1997); the Western Ride with the Devil (1999); the martial arts wuxia drama Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000); the superhero blockbuster Hulk (2003); the romantic drama Brokeback Mountain (2005); the erotic espionage period drama Lust, Caution (2007); and the magic realist survival film Life of Pi (2012). Much of Lee's work is known for its emotional charge and exploration of repressed, hidden emotions, which commentators believe is responsible for his success in offsetting cultural barriers and achieving international recognition. Lee has been nominated for nine Academy Awards, of which he has won three: Best Foreign Language Film for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Best Director for Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi, becoming the first non-white person to win the latter. For The Wedding Banquet and Sense and Sensibility, Lee won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival; for Brokeback Mountain and Lust Caution, he won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

In 1994, the film received the Asia Pacific Film Festival Award for Best Film, and in 1995 it received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. The title is a quote from the Book of Rites, one of the Confucian classics, referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. The beginning of the quote reads as follows: The things which men greatly desire are comprehended in meat and drink and sexual pleasure; [\u2026] (Translation by James Legge), Chinese:\u300c\u98f2\u98df\u7537\u5973\uff0c\u4eba\u4e4b\u5927\u6b32\u5b58\u7109\u300d. Many of the cast members had appeared in Ang Lee's previous films. Sihung Lung and Ah Lei Gua played central elderly figures dealing with the transition from tradition to modernity in The Wedding Banquet, in which Winston Chao also starred. Sihung Lung played an immigrant father in Pushing Hands. These three films show the tensions between the generations of a Confucian family, between East and West, and between tradition and modernity. They form what has been called Lee's Father Knows Best trilogy."
