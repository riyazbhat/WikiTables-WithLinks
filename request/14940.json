It is within the Royal Borough of Greenwich, to which it lends its name. Historically it was in the county of Kent for hundreds of years, then the County of London from 1889 to 1965. Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0\u00b0 longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there, such as Vanbrugh Castle (1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the Cutty Sark and Gipsy Moth IV next to the river front, and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934.",

For architect Alfred Waterhouse alone they collaborated on over 100 buildings, the most significant of which was London's Natural History Museum, with its innovative use of architectural terracotta cladding. After Farmer's death Brindley turned to writing, for instance collaborating with Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema on Marbles Their Ancient and Modern Application.

The road east of Temple Bar and within the City is Fleet Street, while the road to the west, in Westminster, is The Strand. At Temple Bar, the Corporation of the City of London formerly erected a barrier to regulate trade into the City. The 19th century Royal Courts of Justice are located next to it on its north side, having been moved from Westminster Hall. To its south is the Temple Church, along with the Inner Temple and Middle Temple Inns of Court. As the most important entrance to the City of London from Westminster, it was formerly long the custom for the monarch to halt at Temple Bar before entering the City of London, in order for the Lord Mayor to offer the Corporation's pearl-encrusted Sword of State as a token of loyalty. The term 'Temple Bar' strictly refers to a notional bar or barrier across the route, but it is commonly used to refer to the 17th-century ornamental Baroque arched gateway designed by Christopher Wren, which spanned the road until its removal in 1878. A memorial pedestal topped by a dragon symbol of London, and containing an image of Queen Victoria, was erected to mark the bar's location in 1880.

  "/wiki/Victoria_Square,_London": "Victoria Square is a small,[a] rectangular garden square 50 metres south of the remaining stables of The Royal Mews (on the large green block taken up by Buckingham Palace) and 150 metres north of Victoria bus station (which stands in front of Victoria Station (London)). It has a statue of the young Queen Victoria. It separated by the main wing of the Goring Hotel from an almost identical-size space between buildings, as private gardens for the hotel, backed by one road, instead of its four private close-style roads with parking and sets of pavements. Most of the Victoria and Belgravia area is the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate as to minor, overarching legal interests, the more valuable freehold of let shops and as to open spaces; this square is such an instance, which has a lasting influence on local planning policy and which has had some loss of interest by outright sales, some of which facilitated by the laws of leasehold reform."
