  "/wiki/List_of_National_Hockey_League_retired_numbers": "This is a complete list of numbers retired by the National Hockey League (NHL). A retired number is a jersey number that is taken out of circulation by a team as a way of honouring a former member of that team who wore that number; after the number's retirement, members of that team are not permitted to wear the number on their jerseys unless by permission of the original number holder.\n The first team to retire a number was the Toronto Maple Leafs, which retired Ace Bailey's number 6 on February 14, 1934, prior to an All-Star game organized in his honour.\n The NHL currently has 128 retired numbers, 3 pending number retirements, 7 former retirements, and 23 honoured numbers. Most of the numbers retired by the Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques were put back in circulation when those franchises relocated and became the Carolina Hurricanes and Colorado Avalanche\n, respectively, although the Hurricanes keep Gordie Howe's number 9 unofficially retired. The Minnesota North Stars' two retired numbers were carried over when that franchise relocated to become the Dallas Stars, and remain retired today.  The Arizona Coyotes had a policy of retaining the numbers retired when the franchise was the Winnipeg Jets but reversed it after the Phoenix Coyotes were sold and became the Arizona Coyotes. Honoured numbers are similar to retired numbers, except that they remain available for use by other players. Presently, only the Calgary Flames, and the St. Louis Blues employ this designation. The Philadelphia Flyers have also unofficially retired number 31 in honour of goaltender Pelle Lindbergh since his death in 1985.\n Wayne Gretzky's number 99 has been retired league-wide in 2000, although the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings separately retired Gretzky's number.\n Upon joining the league in 2000, the Minnesota Wild had a ceremony retiring number 1 from circulation as a tribute to their fans.\n Twelve numbers have been retired by a team in honour of two different players: number 12 by the Montreal Canadiens for Dickie Moore and Yvan Cournoyer, number 16 by the Montreal Canadiens for Elmer Lach and Henri Richard, number 3 by the Chicago Blackhawks for Pierre Pilote and Keith Magnuson, number 5 by the Canadiens for Bernie Geoffrion and Guy Lapointe, number 9 by the New York Rangers for Andy Bathgate and Adam Graves, number 1 by the Toronto Maple Leafs for Johnny Bower and Turk Broda, number 4 by the Maple Leafs for Hap Day and Red Kelly, number 7 by the Maple Leafs for King Clancy and Tim Horton, number 9 by the Maple Leafs for Charlie Conacher and Ted Kennedy, number 10 by the Maple Leafs for Syl Apps and George Armstrong, and number 27 by the Maple Leafs for Frank Mahovlich and Darryl Sittler, and number 11 by the Rangers for Vic Hadfield and Mark Messier.\n Only nine players have had their number retired by two different NHL teams:"
