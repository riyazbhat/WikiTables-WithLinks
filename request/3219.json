The Acad\u00e9mie was established in the 19th century as an alternative to the government-sanctioned \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts that had, in the eyes of many promising young artists at the time, become far too conservative. Along with its equivalent Acad\u00e9mie Julian, and unlike the official \u00c9cole, the Colarossi school accepted female students and allowed them to draw from the nude male model. Among the female attendees were Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, Modigliani's muse; Scottish Impressionist Bessie MacNicol; Canadian Impressionist Emily Carr; and French sculptor Camille Claudel, who was also a student of Rodin's. Noted also for its classes in life sculpting, the school attracted many foreign students, including a large number from the United States. In 1910, the progressive Acad\u00e9mie appointed the New Zealand artist Frances Hodgkins (1869\u20131947) as its first female teacher.",
