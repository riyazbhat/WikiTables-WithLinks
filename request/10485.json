Currie and (now-Judge) Frank H. Easterbrook in 1983. Currie argued that \"impartial examination of Duvall's performance reveals to even the uninitiated observer that he achieved an enviable standard of insignificance against which all other justices must be measured.\" Easterbrook responded that Currie's analysis lacked \"serious consideration of candidates so shrouded in obscurity that they escaped proper attention even in a contest of insignificance,\" and concluded that Duvall's colleague, Justice Thomas Todd, was even more insignificant.",
