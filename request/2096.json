  "/wiki/Jack_Rabbit_(Kennywood)": "Jack Rabbit is a wooden roller coaster located at Kennywood Park near Pittsburgh in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. Designed and built by John A. Miller and Harry C. Baker, Jack Rabbit opened in 1920, making it is one of the oldest roller coasters in the world still in operation, and it's tied with Jack Rabbit at Seabreeze Amusement Park for being the oldest in the United States. The ride's three trains were manufactured by Edward Vettel, Sr. in 1951 and contain three cars of six seats each.  The aging cars are considered a part of the ride's nostalgic experience but also lead to some young children being disallowed to enter the ride (42\u201d is the minimum), due to the use of a small lap bar to hold in riders.  A popular early feature of the ride was a tunnel which covered the turnaround section after the first drop, but this was removed in 1947 when the new cars were ordered. In 1991, the tunnel was restored, at a slightly shorter length.",
