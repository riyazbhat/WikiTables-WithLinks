  "/wiki/Alanine": "Alanine (symbol Ala or A) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain.  Consequently, its IUPAC systematic name is 2-aminopropanoic acid, and it is classified as a nonpolar, aliphatic \u03b1-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as \u2212NH3+) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as \u2212CO2\u2212).  It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesised metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet. It is encoded by all codons starting with GC (GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG).",
