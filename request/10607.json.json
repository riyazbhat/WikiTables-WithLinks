Decade, as its title suggests, is the tenth of the Heisei Rider Series, having begun with Kamen Rider Kuuga in 2000. It began broadcasting the week following the finale of Kamen Rider Kiva and was featured in Super Hero Time alongside the 2009 edition of the Super Sentai Series, Samurai Sentai Shinkenger. The series ties in with the arcade game Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbaride, with Kamen Riders Decade and Diend using cards resembling those used in the game to transform and access various weapons. Inspiration for this series was very likely to have been the fact that Toei had successfully ensured that the Kamen Rider series lasted a whole decade (2000-2009) without the show going into a period of hiatus which had always occurred since the franchise began in the 1970s. The series' English dub aired on October 20, 2012, 5:30\u00a0p.m. at Singapore's Okto Channel, Mediacorp.
