  "/wiki/Kaspars_Petrovs": "Kaspars Petrovs (born 1978) is a Latvian serial killer. He was convicted of the murder of thirteen elderly women by the Riga Regional Court on May 12, 2005 and sentenced to life in prison. Petrovs, the son of a prominent medical doctor, had been homeless for several years. Initially held in connection with the murders of five women in February 2003, he later confessed to killing more than thirty women. He was initially charged with 38 murders, 8 attempted murders, and a number of theft and robberies, mostly involving elderly female residents of Riga, Latvia between 2000 and 2003. However, authorities only pursued charges in the deaths of 13 of the victims due to a lack of forensic evidence in the other cases. Petrovs, who had a previous conviction for theft in 1998, maintained after his arrest and during his 2005 trial that he had not intended to kill his victims, but only to rob them. Petrovs strangled the women after following them home and forcibly entering their apartments or posing as a Latvijas g\u0101ze (state gas company) employee.",

  "/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma": "The B-cell lymphomas are types of lymphoma affecting B cells. Lymphomas are blood cancers in the lymph nodes. They develop more frequently in older adults and in immunocompromised individuals. B-cell lymphomas include both Hodgkin's lymphomas and most non-Hodgkin lymphomas. They are typically divided into low and high grade, typically corresponding to indolent (slow-growing) lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas, respectively. As a generalisation, indolent lymphomas respond to treatment and are kept under control (in remission) with long-term survival of many years, but are not cured. Aggressive lymphomas usually require intensive treatments, with some having a good prospect for a permanent cure. Prognosis and treatment depends on the specific type of lymphoma as well as the stage and grade.",
