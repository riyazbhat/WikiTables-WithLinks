  "/wiki/Amla%C3%ADb_Cuar%C3%A1n": "Amla\u00edb mac Sitric (c. 927\u00a0\u2013 980; Old Norse: \u00d3l\u00e1fr Sigtryggsson), commonly called Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n, in Old Norse: \u00d3l\u00e1fr kv\u00e1ran, was a 10th-century Norse-Gael who was King of Northumbria and Dublin. His byname, cuar\u00e1n, is usually translated as \"sandal\". His name appears in a variety of anglicized forms, including Olaf Cuaran and Olaf Sihtricson, particularly in relation to his short-lived rule in York. He was the last of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair to play a major part in the politics of the British Isles.",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Dublin": "Vikings invaded the territory around Dublin in the 9th century, establishing the Norse Kingdom of Dublin, the earliest and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ireland. Its territory corresponded to most of present-day County Dublin. The Norse referred to the kingdom as Dyflin, which is derived from Irish  Dubh Linn, meaning 'black pool'. The first reference to the Vikings comes from the Annals of Ulster and the first entry for 841 AD reads: \"Pagans still on Lough Neagh\". It is from this date onward that historians get references to ship fortresses or longphorts being established in Ireland. It may be safe to assume that the Vikings first over-wintered in 840\u2013841 AD. The actual location of the longphort of Dublin is still a hotly debated issue. Norse rulers of Dublin were often co-kings, and occasionally also Kings of J\u00f3rv\u00edk in what is now Yorkshire. Under their rule, Dublin became the biggest slave port in Western Europe.",
  "/wiki/Northumbria": "The Kingdom of Northumbria (/n\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8\u03b8\u028cmbri\u0259/; Old English: Nor\u00feanhymbra R\u012b\u010be; Latin: Regnum Northanhymbrorum) was a medieval Anglian kingdom in what is now Northern England and south-east Scotland. The name derives from the Old English Nor\u00fean-hymbre meaning  \"the people or province north of the Humber\", which reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the Humber Estuary. Northumbria started to consolidate into one kingdom in the early seventh century, when the two earlier core territories of Deira and Bernicia entered into a dynastic union. At its height, the kingdom extended from the Humber, Peak District and the River Mersey on the south to the Firth of Forth (now in Scotland) on the north. Northumbria ceased to be an independent kingdom in the mid-tenth century, though a rump Earldom of Bamburgh survived around Bernicia in the north, later to be absorbed into the medieval kingdoms of Scotland and England.",
  "/wiki/Iona": "Iona (Scottish Gaelic: \u00cc Chaluim Chille, sometimes simply \u00cc) is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland. It is mainly known for Iona Abbey, though there are other buildings on the island. Iona Abbey was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for three centuries and is today known for its relative tranquility and natural environment. It is a tourist destination and a place for spiritual retreats. Its modern Scottish Gaelic name means \"Iona of (Saint) Columba\" (formerly anglicised \"Icolmkill\").",
  "/wiki/Maccus_mac_Arailt": "Maccus mac Arailt (fl. 971\u2013974) was a tenth-century King of the Isles.[note 1] Although his parentage is uncertain, surviving evidence suggests that he was the son of Aralt mac Sitriuc, King of Limerick. Maccus' family is known as the Meic Arailt kindred. He and his brother, Gofraid, are first recorded in the 970s. It was during this decade and the next that they conducted military operations against the Welsh of Anglesey, apparently taking advantage of dynastic strife within the Kingdom of Gwynedd.",
  "/wiki/Edgar_the_Peaceful": "Edgar  (Old English: \u0112adg\u0101r, [\u00e6\u02d0\u0251d\u0263\u0251\u02d0r]; c.\u2009943\u00a0\u2013 8 July 975), known as the Peaceful or the Peaceable, was King of England from 959 until his death. He was the younger son of Edmund I and \u00c6lfgifu of Shaftesbury, and came to the throne as a teenager, following the death of his older brother Eadwig. As king, Edgar further consolidated the political unity achieved by his predecessors, with his reign being noted for its relative stability. His most trusted advisor was Dunstan, whom he recalled from exile and made Archbishop of Canterbury. The pinnacle of Edgar's reign was his coronation at Bath in 973, which was organised by Dunstan and forms the basis for the current coronation ceremony. After his death he was succeeded by his son Edward, although the succession was disputed.",
  "/wiki/Gofraid_mac_Arailt": "Gofraid mac Arailt (died 989), in Old Norse Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Haraldsson, was a Scandinavian or Norse-Gael king. He and his brother Maccus were active in the lands around the Irish Sea in the 970s and 980s.",
  "/wiki/Gilli_(Hebridean_earl)": "Gilli was an eleventh-century Hebridean chieftain whose career coincided with an era of Orcadian overlordship in the Kingdom of the Isles. According to mediaeval saga-tradition, Gilli was a brother-in-law of Sigur\u00f0r Hl\u01eb\u00f0visson, Earl of Orkney, having married the latter's sister Hvarfl\u01eb\u00f0. Traditionally regarded as one of the most powerful Orcadian earls, Sigur\u00f0r appears to have extended his authority into the Isles in the late tenth century. Gilli apparently acted as Sigur\u00f0r's viceroy or tributary earl in the region. The time frame of Gilli's apparent authority in the Isles is uncertain, and may date as early as the reign of Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r Haraldsson, King of the Isles, or as late as the period following the death of this man's eventual successor, R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, King of the Isles. Gilli's name is probably Gaelic in origin, and he seems to have seated himself on either Coll or Colonsay, islands in the Inner Hebrides. It is possible that Gilli is identical to Gilla Ciar\u00e1in mac Gl\u00fan Iairn, an U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynast who was slain at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. If not, another possibility is that he was the father of a certain Conamal/Conm\u00e1el who was killed in 980.",
  "/wiki/Sigurd_the_Stout": "Sigurd Hlodvirsson (circa 960\u00a0\u2013 23 April 1014), popularly known as Sigurd the Stout from the  Old Norse Sigur\u00f0r digri, was an Earl of Orkney. The main sources for his life are the Norse Sagas, which were first written down some two centuries or more after his death. These engaging stories must therefore be treated with caution rather than as reliable historical documents.[Note 1]",
  "/wiki/Earl_of_Orkney": "The Earl of Orkney was originally a Norse jarl ruling the archipelagos of Orkney and Shetland (Nor\u00f0reyjar). Originally founded by Norse invaders, the status of the rulers of the Nor\u00f0reyjar as Norwegian vassals was formalised in 1195. Although the Old Norse term jarl is etymologically related to \"earl\", and the jarls were succeeded by earls in the late 15th century, a Norwegian jarl is not the same thing. In the Norse context the distinction between jarls and kings did not become significant until the late 11th century and the early jarls would therefore have had considerable independence of action until that time. The position of Jarl of Orkney was eventually the most senior rank in mediaeval Norway except for the king himself.",
  "/wiki/Mormaer_of_Caithness": "The Mormaer of Caithness was a vassal title mostly held by members of the Norwegian nobility based in Orkney from the Viking Age until 1350. The mormaerdom was held as fief of Scotland and the title was frequently held by the Norse Earls of Orkney, who were thus a vassal of both the King of Norway and the King of Scots. There is no other example in the history of either Norway or of Scotland in which a dynasty of earls owed their allegiance to two different kings.",
  "/wiki/Ragnall_mac_Gofraid": "Ragnall mac Gofraid (died 1004/1005) was King of the Isles and likely a member of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair kindred.[note 1] He was a son of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles. Ragnall and Gofraid flourished at a time when the Kingdom of the Isles seems to have suffered from Orcadian encroachment at the hands of Sigur\u00f0r Hl\u01eb\u00f0visson, Earl of Orkney. Gofraid died in 989. Although Ragnall is accorded the kingship upon his own death in 1004 or 1005, the succession after his father's death is uncertain.",

He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide, which often misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers, contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour.",

A member of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty, his ancestors also included Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n and Gormflaith, who were influential in medieval Ireland.  He was held to ransom by the Gaelic lord of Brega and later killed in England by Anglo-Saxons while on his way on pilgrimage to Rome in 1034. He thus predeceased his father. Some of his descendants later became the Kings of Gwynedd in Wales.",

He was caught up in the abortive Leinster revolt of 999\u20131000, after which he was forced to submit to the King of Munster, Brian Boru.  His family also conducted a double marriage alliance with Boru, although he later realigned himself with the main leaders of the Leinster revolt of 1012\u20131014.
