It was the 13th staging of the event, and the last tournament to be staged that year. \nScott Waites was in blistering form as he won the tournament for the first time, beating Martin Adams to get to the final in a sudden-death leg with a 105.12 average. Darryl Fitton was his opponent in the final, and missed two match darts for a 5\u20133 victory and his second Zuiderduin Masters win. Waites missed the double 18 for a nine-dart finish on his way to completing the comeback. It was a very high scoring match, with Waites hitting 16 180s and Fitton hitting 15.",
