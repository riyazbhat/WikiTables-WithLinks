It was the 13th staging of the event, and the last tournament to be staged that year. \nScott Waites was in blistering form as he won the tournament for the first time, beating Martin Adams to get to the final in a sudden-death leg with a 105.12 average. Darryl Fitton was his opponent in the final, and missed two match darts for a 5\u20133 victory and his second Zuiderduin Masters win. Waites missed the double 18 for a nine-dart finish on his way to completing the comeback. It was a very high scoring match, with Waites hitting 16 180s and Fitton hitting 15.",

  "/wiki/Finder_Darts_Masters": "The Finder Darts Masters was a darts tournament held in Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands, sanctioned by the British Darts Organisation and the World Darts Federation, running intermittently under several different names from 1995 to 2018.\n The tournament was previously known as the Zuiderduin Masters from 2007 to 2014, as the Leendesk Masters in 2005, as the Doeland Grand Masters from 2001 to 2004, as the European Grand Masters in 2000, and as the Dutch Grand Masters in 1995 and 1996. It was held in December and was traditionally the last BDO event held before the annual World Championship.  The tournament was an unranked event until 2008, when it was installed as a ranking event, along with the World Championships and the World Masters, following the cancellation of the World Darts Trophy and the International Darts League.\n The organizers of the event announced in 2019 that that year's event would not take place due to the termination of the sponsorship with Dutch e-commerce company Finder, and the tournament has been discontinued."
