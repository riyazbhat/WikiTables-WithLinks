  "/wiki/Chambertin": "Chambertin is an Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red wine in the C\u00f4te de Nuits subregion of Burgundy, with Pinot noir as the main grape variety. Chambertin is located within the commune of Gevrey-Chambertin, and it is situated approximately in the centre of a group of nine Grand Cru vineyards all having \"Chambertin\" as part of their name. The other eight vineyards, which all are separate AOCs, have hyphenated names where Chambertin appears together with something else, such as Chapelle-Chambertin. Chambertin itself is situated above (to the west of) the Route des Grands Crus. It borders on Chambertin-Clos de B\u00e8ze in the north, Griotte-Chambertin and Charmes-Chambertin in the east (across the road) and the Latrici\u00e8res-Chambertin in the south. The AOC was created in 1937. Of the surrounding vineyards, wines from Chambertin-Clos de B\u00e8ze may also be sold under the Chambertin AOC. However, Chambertin-Clos de B\u00e8ze has a very good reputation on its own, so this is not widely practiced.",
  "/wiki/Burgundy_wine": "Burgundy wine (French: Bourgogne or vin de Bourgogne) is wine made in the Burgundy region in eastern France, in the valleys and slopes west of the Sa\u00f4ne, a tributary of the Rh\u00f4ne. The most famous wines produced here\u2014those commonly referred to as \"Burgundies\"\u2014are dry red wines made from Pinot noir grapes and white wines made from Chardonnay grapes.\n Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties, such as Gamay and Aligot\u00e9, respectively. Small amounts of ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines are also produced in the region. Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and Gamay-dominated Beaujolais are formally part of the Burgundy wine region, but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as \"Burgundy wines\".\n Burgundy has a higher number of appellations d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOCs) than any other French region, and is often seen as the most terroir-conscious of the French wine regions. The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated Grand Cru vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations. The practice of delineating vineyards by their terroir in Burgundy goes back to medieval times, when various monasteries played a key role in developing the Burgundy wine industry.",

As Charmes-Chambertin is the more popular to use, relatively little wine is bottled as Mazoy\u00e8res-Chambertin, which is only around 10 per cent of the production.\n Another grand cru vineyard in Gevrey Chambertin with a similar name, but no other connection is Mazis-Chambertin which is also known as Mazy-Chambertin.",
