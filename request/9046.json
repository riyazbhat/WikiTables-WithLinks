He stood again in 1922 and 1923, as a Labour Co-operative candidate with the endorsement of the Labour Party, losing in both elections by a narrow margin of less than 3% of the votes.\n He won the seat on his fourth attempt, at the 1924 general election, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Herbert Harvey Spencer. Hirst was re-elected in 1929 with an increased majority.\n However, at the 1931 general election, the Labour Party had split over Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form a National government with the support of both the Conservative Liberal parties, and Hirst was opposed in Bradford only by a Liberal candidate, the Conservatives having stepped aside. He lost his seat by a huge margin of 32.6% of the votes.\n Hirts's seventh and final candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was defeated again, although he halved the Liberal majority to 16.8%.",

  "/wiki/Frank_Broad": "Francis Alfred Broad JP (1874 \u2013 3 January 1956), usually known as Frank Broad, was a Labour politician in the United Kingdom who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Municipal Borough of Edmonton during the years 1922\u20131931 and 1935\u20131945.\n One of the founder members[i] of the Amalgamated Instrument Makers Trade Society,[ii] Broad was president when, in 1920, the union joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). He remained a member of the AEU until his death, stating in the commons in 1931 that \"... I have never been a paid officer of that union but I have 40 years membership in it\". He joined the Independent Labour Party in 1893.\n In July 1923, on the subject of birth control, Broad \"... asked the Minister of Health whether his Department will raise any objection to birth control information being given at infant welfare centres to married women who desire it by voluntary workers attached to the centres, or otherwise to their being informed, on request, where such information can be obtained?\". Mr Chamberlain replied that his \"... view is that such information as is referred to should not be given at infant welfare centres, but that women for whom it appears to be needed on medical grounds should be referred to a private doctor or a hospital\". In May 1924, Broad led a delegation of the birth control movement to the then health minister, Clydesdale MP John Wheatley. The delegates included H G Wells, the Hon. Mrs Bertrand (Dora) Russell, Dr Frances Huxley, and others. Wheatley dodged the issue with the pronouncement \"A clear distinction must be drawn between allowing access to knowledge, and actually distributing knowledge\".\n Broad produced two papers. A memorandum on birth control: presented on 9 May 1924 to the Workers Birth Control Group, and The organised worker: problems of Trade union structure and policy; a report by the Industrial Policy Committee published by the Independent Labour Party (Great Britain). Broad was part of the Empire Parliamentary Association 1926 delegation to Australia chaired by the Marquis of Salisbury. At the civic reception in the Sydney Millions Club on the day of arrival, 17\u00a0September 1926, Broad said \"A country like Australia is capable of absorbing a great number of people and the problem must be precipitated in a proper spirit of understanding\".\n He was made a justice of the peace in 1933. Broad announced in 1944 that he did not intend to stand as a parliamentary candidate again, saying, \"The world is rather cluttered up with older men\". He retired from politics in 1945. He was awarded the freedom of Edmonton in September 1946.\n He was for a time a governor of The Latymer School and a board member of the North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton; the same hospital where he died from a short illness on 3 January 1956. Broad House, Fore Street, Edmonton, London, is a permanent memorial. It was opened in 1954 by Clement Attlee. Broad was survived by his wife since 1900, Eliza Broad n\u00e9e Macer and three sons.",

In April 1918 he was arrested for sedition, and his 75-minute speech from the dock became a celebrated text for Scottish left-wingers. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, but was released after the November armistice.\n Maclean believed that Scottish workers were especially fitted to lead the revolution, and talked of \"Celtic communism\", inspired by clan spirit. But his launch of a Scottish Workers Republican Party and a Scottish Communist Party were largely unsuccessful. Although he had been appointed Bolshevik representative in Scotland, he was not in harmony with the Communist Party of Great Britain, even though it had absorbed the British Socialist Party, to which he had belonged. In captivity, Maclean had been on hunger strike, and prolonged force-feeding had permanently affected his health. He collapsed during a speech and died of pneumonia, aged forty-four.",

He became involved in the socialist movement when he was eighteen, and two years later joined both the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE).  For some time, he also held membership of the Independent Labour Party.\n Early in the 1900s, Gorman moved to Salford, where he was rapidly elected as assistant secretary of his branch of the ASE.  He was also elected as a delegate to the union's conferences in 1907, 1912, 1915 and 1917.  But he was most prominent in the union as a member of its Final Appeal Court, which considered the cases of members who had broken union rules.  In order to prepare for the position, he studied the history of the union and its forerunners, and obtained copies of union rules of which its general office was unaware.\n In 1917, Gorman began working full-time for the union as its Manchester Local Delegate, and the following year became its Organising District Delegate.  From 1911 until 1925, he also served as a delegate to the Manchester and Salford Trades Council.\n Gorman was elected to Salford City Council for St Thomas' ward in 1918, serving for three years.  He was then elected in a 1923 by-election in Weaste ward, and became known for his campaign for the city to form a civic choir, but lost the seat in 1925.\n Gorman stood in Salford South at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, taking a distant second place, with 19.0% of the vote.  He represented the Labour Party, but was sponsored by the British Socialist Party, successor of the SDF, and ran a very left-wing campaign.  At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, he again stood for the Labour Party, but this time in Plymouth Drake, where he replaced Prospective Parliamentary Candidate William Henry Watkins, who had fallen out with the local party.  Gorman was sponsored by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, successor of the ASE, and took 31.4% of the vote.\n By 1932, Gorman was resident in Higher Crumpsall in Manchester, and was elected to Manchester City Council that year.  He was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Northwich in 1937, but although an election was expected in 1939 or 1940, it was not held due to World War II, and Gorman never contested the seat.  He retired from his trade union posts in 1939, and became a Labour Supply Officer for the council during the war.

  "/wiki/Alf_Barton": "Alfred Barton (30 July 1868 \u2013 9 December 1933) was a British socialist politician.\n Born in Kempston in Bedfordshire, Barton began working in a library at the age of twelve.  He joined the Socialist League at some point in the 1880s, then in about 1890, he moved to Manchester, where he quickly found work at the John Rylands Library.  At this time, Alf was on the anarchist wing of the Socialist League, and was prominent in the protests following the police provocations against Walsall Anarchists.  Although he was arrested several times for making speeches, he was firmly opposed to violence in the anarchist cause.\n Barton married Eleanor Stockton in 1894, who was to become prominent in the co-operative movement, and the two moved to Sheffield in 1897.  Alf joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and quickly became prominent locally through his opposition to the Second Boer War; he later also joined the Social Democratic Federation.  He joined the Shop Assistants' Union and was its delegate to Sheffield Federated Trades Council, and within it campaigned for it to affiliate to the Labour Representation Committee.  It did so, but resulting disagreements about local candidates led the council to split, Barton being prominent on the local Labour Representation Committee.  In 1907, he was elected to Sheffield City Council for the renamed Labour Party, representing Brightside.\n In 1907, Barton was appointed as secretary of the Sheffield ILP, and he also edited its weekly newspaper, the Sheffield Guardian.  However, he lost his council seat in 1910, and in 1911 he resigned from the ILP entirely due to disagreements between himself and Joseph Pointer.  The Labour Party would not endorse him in that year's local elections, so he instead ran for the SDF in Heeley, and was not successful.  He persuaded Labour not to stand against him in Brightside in following years, and won his seat back in 1913.  The SDF became the British Socialist Party (BSP) and in 1914 affiliated to the Labour Party, Barton becoming an official part of its group on the council once more.  He was shortlisted as the party's candidate for the 1914 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, but was not selected.\n Barton supported British involvement in World War I, but he remained in the BSP rather than joining one of its pro-war splits.  He stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Sheffield Park at the 1918 general election, then briefly joined the Communist Party of Britain (CPGB) on its formation, but resigned after less than a month, to rejoin the ILP and, by extension, the Labour Party.  He stood in Harwich at the 1922 general election, losing his deposit, and the same year also lost his council seat, although he won a seat in Hillsborough in 1926.
