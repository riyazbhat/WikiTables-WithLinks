  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Beep_(SWBLW)": "The \"Beep\" (also referred to as the SWBLW) is an individual switcher locomotive built in 1970 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at its Cleburne, Texas, workshops. Technically a rebuild, the Beep (a portmanteau of \"Baldwin Geep\", whose official designation was derived from \"SWitcher, Baldwin Locomotive Works\") originally entered service on the Santa Fe as a Baldwin Model VO-1000. Following its successful CF7 capital rebuilding program, the company hoped to determine if remanufacturing its aging, non-EMD end cab switchers by fitting them with new EMD prime movers was an economically viable proposition. The conversion procedure proved too costly and only the one unit was modified. As of end of 2008 per Trains Magazine March 2009, this locomotive was retired and stored operational at Topeka, Kansas. In May 2009 the unit was donated to the Western America Railroad Museum in Barstow, California.",
  "/wiki/EMD_567": "The EMD 567 is a line of large medium-speed diesel engines built by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division. This engine, which succeeded Winton's 201A, was used in EMD's locomotives from 1938 until its replacement in 1966 by the EMD 645. It has a bore of 8\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in (216\u00a0mm), a stroke of 10\u00a0in (254\u00a0mm) and a displacement of 567\u00a0cu\u00a0in (9.29\u00a0L) per cylinder. Like the Winton 201A, the EMD 645 and the EMD 710, the EMD 567 is a two-stroke engine.",
  "/wiki/CF7": "The CF7 is an EMD F-unit railroad locomotive that has had its streamlined carbody removed and replaced with a custom-made, \"general purpose\" body in order to adapt the unit for switching duty. All of the conversions were performed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in their Cleburne, Texas workshops between October, 1970 and March, 1978. The program was initiated in response to a system-wide need for more than 200 additional four-axle diesel road switchers to meet projected motive power demands on branch lines and secondary main lines.",

  "/wiki/GP15C": "An EMD GP9 is a four-axle road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division produced between 1954 and 1959 and it is powered by a sixteen-cylinder engine which generated 1,750 horsepower (1.30\u00a0MW). The GP9 succeeded the GP7. The lettering \"GP\" stands for \"general purpose\". This locomotive type was offered both with and without control cabs; locomotives built without control cabs were called GP9B locomotives.",

Caterpillar stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
  "/wiki/GP16": "The EMD GP16 was a series of rebuilt road switcher diesel-electric locomotives, a result of a remanufacturing program initiated by the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL) in an effort to spare the cost of purchasing new motive power in the late 1970s. This involved the rebuilding of their aging fleet of EMD GP7, GP9, and GP18 road switchers (many of which were over twenty years old). 155 locomotives (122 GP7, 31 GP9 and two GP18) were rebuilt by the SCL.",
  "/wiki/EMD_645": "The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors. While the 645 series was intended primarily for locomotive, marine and stationary engine use, one 16-cylinder version powered the 33-19 \"Titan\" prototype haul truck designed by GM's Terex division.",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand_DB_class_locomotive": "The New Zealand DB class and DBR class locomotive is a type of diesel-electric locomotive built for service on New Zealand's rail network. They were built by General Motors Diesel (GMD) of Canada as a narrow-gauge version of the EMD G8 model, with seventeen locomotives constructed. Ten of these were later rebuilt into the DBR class.",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand_DC_class_locomotive": "The New Zealand DC class is a class of diesel-electric mainline locomotive on the New Zealand rail network, operated by KiwiRail on freight trains, and formerly on long-distance KiwiRail Scenic passenger trains. The class was rebuilt from the DA class in the late 1970s and early 1980s, mainly in Australia. After the DA class they were the most numerous class of diesel locomotive on New Zealand's railway network, and remained numerically dominant until the mid-2010s when withdrawals began.",

Most of these passenger locomotives were rebuilt from older freight locomotives, while some were built as brand new models.",
  "/wiki/Head_end_power": "In rail transport, head-end power (HEP), also known as electric train supply (ETS), is the electrical power distribution system on a passenger train. The power source, usually a locomotive (or a generator car) at the front or 'head' of a train, provides the electricity used for heating, lighting, electrical and other 'hotel' needs.  The maritime equivalent is hotel electric power. A successful attempt by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in October 1881 to light the passenger cars between London and Brighton heralded the beginning of using electricity to light trains in the world.",
