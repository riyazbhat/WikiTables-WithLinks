Maserati was initially associated with Ferrari, which was also owned by FCA until being spun off in 2015, but more recently it has become part of the sports car group including Alfa Romeo and Abarth (see section below). In May 2014, due to ambitious plans and product launches, Maserati sold a record of over 3,000 cars in one month. This caused them to increase production of the Quattroporte and Ghibli models. In addition to the Ghibli and Quattroporte, Maserati offers the Maserati GranTurismo, the GranTurismo Convertible, the Maserati Levante (the first ever Maserati SUV).

Due to the confusing nature of the names \"Maserati Coup\u00e9\" and \"Maserati Spyder\" (which could refer to any coup\u00e9 or convertible Maserati has made) the Coup\u00e9 and Spyder are both commonly referred to as the 4200 GT, which is an evolution of the prior model name and a reference to the increase in engine displacement from 3.2 L (3,217 cc) to 4.2 L (4,244 cc). The Spyder was first unveiled to the public at the 2001 Frankfurt Auto Show with the Coup\u00e9's debut following shortly thereafter at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show. Sales in the United States began in March 2002 for the Spyder and in May for the Coup\u00e9.

  "/wiki/Dodge": "Dodge is an American brand of automobile manufactured by FCA US LLC (formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Group LLC), based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles currently include performance cars, though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth. Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the \"Dodge Brothers\" brand in 1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory was located in Hamtramck, Michigan, and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made compact cars (such as the 1963\u201376 Dart) and midsize cars (such as the \"B-Body\" Coronet and Charger from 1966\u201378). The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan.",
