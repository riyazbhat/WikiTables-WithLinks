In 1871, another survey observed four mounds in association with the main earthwork: one was located just east of the enclosure, another directly to the west, a larger one to the southeast, and a small one to the southwest.  The source of a nearby brook lies within the site and transverses the enclosure; the 1871 survey supposed that it had been dug to provide earth for the enclosure.  By the time of this later survey, cultivation had reduced the earthwork to the point that it was nearly indistinguishable.",
