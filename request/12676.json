Now known as the Minnesota Twins, the club was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1901 as the Washington Senators.  In 1905, the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals. The name \"Nationals\" appeared on the uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. However, the names \"Senators\", \"Nationals\" and shorter \"Nats\" were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next 60 years; in 2005, the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal. For a time, from 1911 to 1933, the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball. The team's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time, Walter Johnson. But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility, including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s.
