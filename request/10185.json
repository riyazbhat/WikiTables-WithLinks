  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football, a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer (association football). They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game. A point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills. Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team, or sometimes for themselves. Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates.",

  "/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)": "The power forward (PF), also known as the four, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. Power forwards play a role similar to that of center. They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, one of which is rebounding. Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m). Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals. In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 (1.98 m) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 (2.08 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 (1.83 m) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 (1.91 m).",
