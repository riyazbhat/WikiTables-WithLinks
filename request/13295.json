  "/wiki/Logopandecteision": "Logopandecteision is a 1653 book by Sir Thomas Urquhart, detailing his plans for the creation of an artificial language by that name. The book is written in several parts, most notably including a list of the language's 66 unparalleled excellences; the rest is made up of rants against his creditors, the Church of Scotland, and others whose neglect and wrongdoings prevent him from publishing this perfected language. Where the book deals with the plan of Logopandecteision, it recalls his earlier work Eskybalauron.",

  "/wiki/An_Essay_towards_a_Real_Character_and_a_Philosophical_Language": "An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language (London, 1668) is the best-remembered of the numerous works of John Wilkins, in which he expounds a new universal language, meant primarily to facilitate international communication among scholars, but envisioned for use by diplomats, travelers, and merchants as well.  Unlike many universal language schemes of the period, it was meant merely as an auxiliary to\u2014not a replacement of\u2014existing natural languages.[citation needed]",

  "/wiki/Isotype_(pictograms)": "Isotype (International System of Typographic Picture Education) is a method of showing social, technological, biological, and historical connections in pictorial form. It consists of a set of standardized and abstracted pictorial symbols to represent social-scientific data with specific guidelines on how to combine the identical figures using serial repetition. It was first known as the Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics (Wiener Methode der Bildstatistik), due to its having been developed at the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum in Wien (Social and Economic Museum of Vienna) between 1925 and 1934. The founding director of this museum, Otto Neurath, was the initiator and chief theorist of the Vienna Method. Gerd Arntz was the artist responsible for realising the graphics. The term Isotype was applied to the method around 1935, after its key practitioners were forced to leave Vienna by the rise of Austrian fascism.",
  "/wiki/Pictograph": "A pictogram, also called a pictogramme, pictograph, or simply picto, and in computer usage an icon, is an ideogram that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object. Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance.  A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure, tourism, and geography.",
  "/wiki/Loglan": "Loglan is a constructed language originally designed for linguistic research, particularly for investigating the Sapir\u2013Whorf Hypothesis. The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. In 1960 Scientific American published an article introducing the language. Loglan is the first among, and the main inspiration for, the languages known as logical languages, which also includes Lojban.",
  "/wiki/James_Cooke_Brown": "Dr. James Cooke Brown (July 21, 1921 \u2013 February 13, 2000) was an American sociologist and science fiction author. He is notable for creating the artificial language Loglan and for designing the Parker Brothers board game Careers.",
  "/wiki/Sapir%E2%80%93Whorf_hypothesis": "The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, part of relativism, also known as the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis /s\u0259\u02ccp\u026a\u0259r \u02c8hw\u0254\u02d0rf/, or Whorfianism is a principle claiming that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language.",
  "/wiki/AUI_(language)": "aUI (IPA:/aui/) is a philosophical, a priori language created in the 1950s by W. John Weilgart, Ph.D. (March 9, 1913\u2013 January 26, 1981; born Johann Wolfgang Weixlg\u00e4rtner, and also known as John W. Weilgart) a philosopher and psychoanalyst originally from Vienna, Austria.  He described it as \"the Language of Space\", connoting universal communication, and published the fourth edition of the textbook in 1979; a philosophic description of each semantic element of the language was published in 1975.",
  "/wiki/Ithkuil": "Ithkuil is an experimental constructed language created by American linguist John Quijada. It is designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization. It is a cross between an a priori philosophical and a logical language. It tries to minimize the ambiguities and semantic vagueness found in natural human languages. Ithkuil is notable for its grammatical complexity and extensive phoneme inventory, the latter being simplified in the final version of the language. The name \"Ithkuil\" is an anglicized form of I\u0163ku\u00eel, which in the original form roughly means \"hypothetical representation of a language\". Quijada states he did not create Ithkuil to be auxiliary or used in everyday conversations. He wanted the language to be used for more elaborate and profound fields where more insightful thoughts are expected, such as philosophy, arts, science and politics.",
  "/wiki/L%C3%A1adan": "L\u00e1adan is a feminist constructed language created by Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982 to test the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis, specifically to determine if development of a language aimed at expressing the views of women would shape a culture; a subsidiary hypothesis was that Western natural languages may be better suited for expressing the views of men than women. The language was included in her science fiction Native Tongue series. L\u00e1adan contains a number of words that are used to make unambiguous statements that include how one feels about what one is saying. According to Elgin, this is designed to counter male-centered language's limitations on women, who are forced to respond \"I know I said that, but I meant this\".",

She founded the Science Fiction Poetry Association and is considered an important figure in the field of science fiction constructed languages. Her best-known non-fiction includes the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense series.",
  "/wiki/Tonal_language": "Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning \u2013 that is, to distinguish or to inflect words.  All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast, and other such features in what is called intonation, but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that do have this feature are called tonal languages; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called tonemes, by analogy with phoneme. Tonal languages are common in East and Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Africa, and the Americas; as many as seventy percent of world languages may be tonal.",

  "/wiki/K%C4%93len": "K\u0113len is a constructed language created by Sylvia Sotomayor.  It is an attempt to create a truly alien language by violating a key linguistic universal\u2014namely that all human languages have verbs.  In K\u0113len, relationships between the noun phrases making up the sentence are expressed by one of four relationals.  According to Sotomayor, these relationals perform the functions of verbs but lack any of the semantic content.  However, the semantic content found in common verbs, such as those that are semantic primes, can also be found in K\u0113len's relationals, which calls into question whether K\u0113len is technically verbless.  Despite its distinctive grammar, K\u0113len is an expressive and intelligible language;[citation needed] texts written in K\u0113len have been translated into other languages by several people other than the creator of the language, as may be seen here.  In this interview Sotomayor states that she aims for K\u0113len to be naturalistic apart from its verblessness, and that to achieve this she employs the principle \"change one thing and keep everything else the same\".",
  "/wiki/Verb": "A verb, from  the Latin verbum meaning word, is a word (part of speech) that in syntax conveys an action (bring, read, walk, run, learn), an occurrence (happen, become), or a state of being (be, exist, stand).  In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle to, is the infinitive. In many languages, verbs are inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood, and voice. A verb may also agree with the person, gender or number of some of its arguments, such as its subject, or object. Verbs have tenses: present, to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate that an action has been done; future, to indicate that an action will be done."
