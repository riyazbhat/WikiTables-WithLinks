She is venerated as \"the Mother of Satisfaction\", the meaning of her name. Santoshi Mata is particularly worshipped by women of North India. A vrata (ritual fast) called  the Santoshi Maa vrata performed by women on 16 consecutive Fridays wins the goddess' favour. Santoshi Mata was influenced to be a goddess in the 1960s. Her prayer initially spread through word of mouth, vrata-pamphlet literature, and poster art. Her vrata was gaining popularity with North Indian women. However, it was the 1975 Bollywood film Jai Santoshi Maa (\"Hail to Santoshi Maa\")\u2014narrating the story of the goddess and her ardent devotee Satyavati\u2014which propelled this then little-known \"new\" goddess to the heights of devotional fervour.",
