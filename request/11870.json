  "/wiki/Bishop_House_(New_Brunswick,_New_Jersey)": "The James Bishop House, known as the Bishop House, is a historic building on the College Avenue campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Bishop House was built in 1852 for James Bishop, a prominent businessman and politician from New Brunswick in the latter half of 19th century. Located off of and facing College Avenue, the Bishop House is an example of an Italianate, or \"Italian Villa\" style mansion, popular from the 1850s to late 1870s in New Brunswick. Due to the building's significant associations with architecture, education, industry, politics and religion, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1976.\n The Bishop House was named in honor of James Bishop. Bishop was a politician at the local, state, and federal levels in the 1850s through the 1890s. After the Panic of 1873, Bishop was forced to file for bankruptcy, leading to the firing of his 18 servants and sale of his mansion to Mahlon C. Martin.\n The building was sold to Rutgers University in 1925. It was used as the residence for the Dean of Men and his family until 1934. After 1934, the interior was altered to contain classrooms and offices. This remains its current use. The building still contains its original 42 rooms despite alterations made.",

As of 2018, New Brunswick had a Census-estimated population of 56,100, representing a 3.1% increase from the 55,181 people enumerated at the 2010 United States Census, which in turn had reflected an increase of 6,608 (+13.6%) from the 48,573 counted in the 2000 Census. Due to the concentration of medical facilities in the area, including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Saint Peter's University Hospital, as well as Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey's Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick is known as both the Hub City and the Healthcare City. The corporate headquarters and production facilities of several global pharmaceutical companies are situated in the city, including Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one quarter of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city and in the 1930s one out of three city residents was Hungarian.

  "/wiki/Old_Queens": "Old Queens is the oldest extant building at Rutgers University and is the symbolic heart of the university's campus in New Brunswick in Middlesex County, New Jersey in the United States. Rutgers, the Eighth-oldest college in the United States, was founded in 1766 during the American colonial period as Queen's College a decade before the start of American Revolution. Queen's College was named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the daughter of a German duke who became the queen consort of British king George III. Old Queens is located on a six-acre hilltop city block bounded by Somerset Street, Hamilton Street, College Avenue and George Street that was previously an apple orchard. Donated to the college in 1807 by James Parker, Jr., this city block become known the Queen's Campus and is the historic core of the university. Because of this, by metonymy, the name \"Old Queens\" came to be used as a reference to Rutgers College and is often invoked as an allusive reference to the university or to its administration.\n Designed by American architect John McComb Jr., who also designed New York City's city hall, the cornerstone of Old Queens was laid in 1809 by the college's third president, the Rev. Ira Condict. Due to financial constraints, construction was not completed until 1825. In its early days, Old Queens provided instruction space for lectures, student and faculty housing, as well as space for a college library and chapel that was shared by three institutions simultaneously: the College, its Grammar School (today, Rutgers Preparatory School), and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. Today, Old Queens houses the university's administration including the office of its president and governing boards.\n Old Queens is regarded by architectural experts as one of the finest examples of Federal architecture.[citation needed] Old Queens was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 1976 and listed as a National Historical Landmark.

Kirkpatrick Chapel is among the university's oldest extant buildings, and one of six buildings located on a historic section of the university's College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick known as the Queens Campus. Built in 1872 when Rutgers was a small, private liberal arts college, the chapel was designed by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh at the beginning of his career.  Hardenbergh, a native of New Brunswick, was the great-great-grandson of Rutgers' first president, the Rev. Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh. It was the third of three projects that Hardenbergh designed for the college.\n Kirkpatrick Chapel was named in honour of Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was the wife of Littleton Kirkpatrick, a local attorney and politician who was a member of the board of trustees of Rutgers College from 1841 until his death in 1859. When Sophia Kirkpatrick died in 1871, Rutgers was named as the residuary legatee of her estate. A bequest of $61,054.57 (2013: US$1,174,079.38)[a] from her estate funded the construction of the chapel. According to Rutgers, this marked the first time in New Jersey history that an institution became a direct heir to an estate.\n The chapel was designed in the High Victorian Gothic Revival style that was popular at the middle of the nineteenth century in the United States. Hardenbergh's design incorporated features common to fourteenth-century German and English Gothic churches. According to the New Jersey Historic Trust, the chapel's stained glass windows feature \"some of the first opalescent and multicolored sheet glass manufactured in America.\"  Four of the chapel's windows were created by the studios of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Kirkpatrick Chapel is a contributing property of the Queens Campus Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1973.\n For its first 30 years, the chapel was used as a college library and for holding daily chapel services. Although Rutgers was founded as a private college affiliated with the Dutch Reformed faith, today, it is a state university and nonsectarian. The chapel is available to students, alumni, and faculty of all faiths, and a variety of services are held throughout the academic term.
