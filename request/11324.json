  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis.",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols.[note 1] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position; alternatively, a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector.\nA common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and elevation.\nTo specify a location on a plane requires a map projection.",
  "/wiki/Gitaru_Hydroelectric_Power_Station": "The Gitaru Hydroelectric Power Station, also known as the Gitaru Dam, is a rock and earth-filled embankment dam on the Tana River in Kenya. It straddles the border between Embu and Machakos Counties in the Eastern Province. The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation, and it supports a 225 megawatt power station. Construction on the dam began in 1975 and was completed in 1978. The third generating set, mobilising the full potential of the power station was not commissioned until 1999. US$63 million in funding for the project was provided by the World Bank. The station is operated by the Kenya Electricity Generating Company and is part of the Seven Forks Scheme.",

  "/wiki/Run_of_river": "Run-of-river hydroelectricity (ROR) or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided. Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage, in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage. A plant without pondage is subject to seasonal river flows, thus the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source. Conventional hydro uses reservoirs, which regulate water for flood control and dispatchable electrical power.",
