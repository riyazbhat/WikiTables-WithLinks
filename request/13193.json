It covers an area of 224 km2 east of Nakhon Sawan, south of the Nan River close to its confluence with the Ping River.\n Originally the area was covered by a large swamp, which was flooded in 1930 with the building of a dam to improve fishing.\n This is the only known site for the white-eyed river martin which used to winter there, but has not been seen since 1980, and may be extinct.\n One hundred-six square kilometres of the lake were declared a non-hunting area in 1975. In 2000 it was designated a wetland of international importance by the Thai government.",
