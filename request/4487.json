  "/wiki/Ian_Paisley": "Ian Richard Kyle Paisley, Baron Bannside PC (6 April 1926 \u2013 12 September 2014), was a loyalist politician and Protestant religious leader from Northern Ireland.\n He became a Protestant evangelical minister in 1946 and remained one for the rest of his life.  In 1951 he co-founded the fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and was its leader until 2008. Paisley became known for his fiery sermons and regularly preached and protested against Roman Catholicism, ecumenism and homosexuality. He gained a large group of followers who were referred to as Paisleyites.\n Paisley became involved in Ulster unionist/loyalist politics in the late 1950s.  In the mid-late 1960s, he led and instigated loyalist opposition to the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. This contributed to the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s, a conflict that would engulf Northern Ireland for the next thirty years. In 1970 he became Member of Parliament for North Antrim and the following year he founded the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which he would lead for almost forty years. In 1979 he became a Member of the European Parliament.\n Throughout the Troubles, Paisley was seen as a firebrand and the face of hardline unionism. He opposed all attempts to resolve the conflict through power-sharing between unionists and Irish nationalists/republicans, and all attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern affairs. His efforts helped bring down the Sunningdale Agreement of 1974. He also opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, with less success. His attempts to create a paramilitary movement culminated in Ulster Resistance. Paisley and his party also opposed the Northern Ireland peace process and Good Friday Agreement of 1998.\n In 2005, Paisley's DUP became the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, displacing the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which had dominated unionist politics since 1905 and had been an instrumental party in the Good Friday Agreement. In 2007, following the St Andrews Agreement, the DUP finally agreed to share power with republican party Sinn F\u00e9in. Paisley and Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness became First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively in May 2007. He stepped down as First Minister and DUP leader in mid-2008, and left politics in 2011. Paisley was made a life peer in 2010 as Baron Bannside.",
  "/wiki/Protestant_Unionist_Party": "The Protestant Unionist Party (PUP) was a unionist political party operating in Northern Ireland from 1966 to 1971. It was the forerunner of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and emerged from the Ulster Protestant Action (UPA) movement. It was founded an led by Ian Paisley, who also founded and led the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.\n The UPA had two councillors elected to Belfast Corporation. In 1967, both were re-elected as PUP candidates. The PUP stood six candidates against the ruling Ulster Unionist Party of the Northern Ireland parliament in the January 1969 general election. They polled over 20,000 votes, but gained no seats.\n When Terence O'Neill (the then Northern Irish Prime Minister) stood down from Stormont in 1970 along with one of his colleagues, the PUP nominated candidates for the two vacant seats. Both were successful. Ian Paisley and fellow Free Presbyterian minister, the Rev. William Beattie, PUP leader and deputy respectively, were elected. In that year's Westminster general election, Paisley was elected to represent Antrim North in the British House of Commons.\n The PUP campaigned for the retention of the Union and for total freedom for Orange parades.[citation needed] The PUP was wound up in 1971 and re-emerged as the DUP in October of that year.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is a unionist political party in Northern Ireland favouring British identity. It was founded in 1971 during the Troubles by Ian Paisley, who led the party for the next 37 years. Now led by Arlene Foster, it is equal with Sinn F\u00e9in in having the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and it is the fifth-largest party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\n The DUP evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party and has historically strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the church Paisley founded. During the Troubles, the DUP were opposed to power-sharing with Irish nationalists or republicans as a means of resolving the conflict, and likewise rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs. It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973, the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. In 2006, the DUP co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and agreed to share power with the republican party Sinn Fein who agreed to support the Police Service, courts, and rule of law.\n The party has been linked to various loyalist paramilitary groups, namely Ulster Resistance (URM) and Third Force. The URM was formed on 10 November 1986 by DUP politicians Paisley, Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster, with the stated aim to \"take direct action as and when required\" to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism. Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). In 1989, URM members attempted to trade Shorts' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime.\n The party has been described as right-wing and socially conservative, being anti-abortion and opposing same-sex marriage. The DUP sees itself as defending Britishness and Ulster Protestant culture against Irish nationalism. The party is Eurosceptic and during the UK European Union (EU) referendum it supported the UK's withdrawal from the EU.\n For most of the DUP's history, the Ulster Unionist Party was the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, but by 2004 the DUP had overtaken the UUP in terms of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly and Parliament. Following the St Andrews Agreement in 2006, the DUP agreed to enter into power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland with Sinn F\u00e9in. Despite reports of divisions within the party, a majority of the party executive voted in favour of power-sharing in 2007. However, the DUP's sole Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Jim Allister, and seven DUP councillors left the party in opposition to its plans to share power with Sinn F\u00e9in, founding the Traditional Unionist Voice. Peter Robinson became DUP leader in 2008, and was succeeded in turn by Arlene Foster in 2015.",

As Irish republican legitimists, they rejected the reformism of Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn F\u00e9in who supported abandoning the policy of abstentionism. They support the \u00c9ire Nua policy which allows for devolution of power to provincial governments. RSF holds that the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916 continues to exist, and that the Continuity Irish Republican Army Council is its de jure government.\n The organisation views itself as representing \"true\" or \"traditional\" Irish republicanism, while in the mainstream media the organisation is portrayed as a political expression of \"dissident republicanism\". Republican Sinn F\u00e9in rejects the Good Friday Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Treaty; as part of this they assert that Irish republicans have the right to use militant means to \"defend the Irish Republic\" and considers the Continuity Irish Republican Army (IRA) to be the legitimate army of the Irish Republic.",

Redmond was a conciliatory politician who achieved the two main objectives of his political life: party unity and, in September 1914, the passing of the Irish Home Rule Act. The Act granted limited self-government to Ireland, within the United Kingdom. However, implementation of Home Rule was suspended by the outbreak of the First World War. Redmond called on the National Volunteers to join Irish regiments of the New British Army and support the British and Allied war effort to restore the \"freedom of small nations\" on the European continent, thereby to also ensure the implementation of Home Rule after a war that was expected to be of short duration. However, after the Easter Rising of 1916, Irish public opinion shifted in favour of militant republicanism and full Irish independence, so that his party lost its dominance in Irish politics.\n In sharp contrast to Parnell, Redmond lacked charisma. He worked well in small committees, but had little success in arousing large audiences. Parnell always chose the nominees to Parliament. Now they were selected by the local party organisations, giving Redmond numerous weak MPs over whom he had little control. Redmond was an excellent representative of the old Ireland, but grew increasingly old-fashioned because he paid little attention to the new forces attracting younger Irishmen, such as Sinn F\u00e9in in politics, the Gaelic Athletic Association in sports, and the Gaelic League in cultural affairs. He never tried to understand the unionist forces emerging in Ulster. Redmond was further weakened in 1914 by the formation by Sinn F\u00e9in members of the Irish Volunteers. His enthusiastic support for the British war effort alienated many Irish nationalists. His party had been increasingly hollowed out, and a major crisis\u2014notably the Easter Rising\u2014was enough to destroy it.",

Two of these were in North Down 'Area B', where sitting councillor George Green, a former Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party member who had been elected to the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention, had joined the party.  The other, Gladys McIntyre, was Mayor of Ards in 1985-86.\n Kilfedder won a seat for the party in North Down at the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election.  Only a minority of his votes transferred to his running mate, George Green, who missed out on taking a second seat by just six votes.  Kilfedder was subsequently elected Speaker of the Assembly.\n Kilfedder held his seat in the UK Parliament at the 1983 general election with a large majority, but fared less well when he stood in the 1984 European election, taking only 2.9% of the first preference votes.  A unionist pact enabled Kilfedder to easily win a by-election in 1986, when he joined the other unionist MPs in resigning in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  A challenge from Bob McCartney, standing as a \"Real Unionist\", led to a close election in 1987, but Kilfedder held on, and beat a Conservative Party opponent in 1992.\n The party was reduced to three councillors in 1985, and remained at this level until Kilfedder's death in 1995. George Green had defected to the Conservative Party before 1989 but the party compensated by gaining a seat in the Dundonald area of Castlereagh. Following Kilfedder's death, the three UPUP councillors went their separate ways, Valerie Kinghan to the newly formed UK Unionist Party. Thomas Jeffers to the Democratic Unionist Party and Cecil Braniff setting up a short-lived independent DUP. No party member contested the North Down by-election resulting from his death.\n The \"Popular Unionist Voice\"  was formed in 2007 in honour of Sir James Kilfedder and promotes his progressive unionist views through publishing letters in the Belfast News Letter, the Irish News and the Islington Tribune in London.

He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a \"Real Unionist\" but failed to win the seat.\n In the 1995 by-election in North Down after the death of Kilfedder he was elected as a \"UK Unionist\" defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which started\nin 1996. The other party representatives to the Forum were Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election.\n He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson in East Antrim).\n However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader's so-called 'exit strategy' from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn F\u00e9in being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four were \"famous in their own living rooms\" and that their supporters could \"fit into a telephone box\". In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice.\n In 1999, McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate Lady Sylvia Hermon.\n He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution for Northern Ireland would no longer be Westminster's abiding policy, there would be no Stormont legislative assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time, the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.\n McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive.\n These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not Northern Ireland.\n McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six different constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone\n He claims to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles. In October 2009, McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn F\u00e9in Education Minister.",

He studied at St Malachy's College and the Royal University of Ireland. He was awarded a BA in 1892, his LL.B in 1894 and an MA in 1897. In 1895, he began editing The Irish News, a local Belfast-based newspaper.  In 1899, he was the Chairman of the Ulster District Institute of Journalists.\n In 1900 Campbell was called to the Irish Bar (King's Inns) and the English Bar in 1904. In 1918 he was appointed as a King's Counsel. He became a Bencher of King's Inns in 1924. Campbell was the first Treasurer of the Bar of Northern Ireland and first Secretary of the Circuit of Northern Ireland.\n A close friend of Joseph Devlin MP, Campbell was a supporter of John Redmond MP and stood for the Irish Parliamentary Party in South Monaghan at the 1918 general election. He lost the election to Sinn F\u00e9in's Sean McEntee (then in prison and later Finance Minister in the first De Valera led Government in the Irish Republic).\n \" A man of markedly moderate views\" in 1929 Campbell was appointed to the Senate of Northern Ireland. At the 1931 general election, he stood unsuccessfully for the Nationalist Party in Belfast West.  In 1934, he was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland in a by-election as Stormont MP for Belfast Central, resigning his seat in the Senate. He was elected unopposed in Belfast Central in the general elections of 1938 and 1945.\n From 1937, he and Richard Byrne were the only Nationalist Party MPs to regularly attend the Stormont Parliament, and after Byrne's death in 1942, he was a lone voice against abstentionism in his own party. From the Senate in 1931 he successfully introduced the only nationalist-sponsored Stormont bill, the Wild Birds Protection Act. Described as an \"old friend and political opponent\" by Lord Craigavon, he was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.\n Campbell has been described as having a \"Redmondite approach and rigid attachment to attendance and parliamentary etiquette (which) ruled him out as a unifying influence\" on his own party after the death of its leader Devlin. ** Campbell opposed the use of violence to achieve political ends throughout his political career.\n His book Fifty Years Of Ulster (1941) was mainly about his work as a barrister, but he also predicted the difficulties which would eventually befall the Stormont Parliament:\n \"If a minority anywhere are to regard themselves as condemned to be in a permanent minority in Parliament with no inducement to tempt ambition or ability into their ranks they will inevitably become discouraged and indifferent. A Parliamentary constitution depends on the continuance of parties and if this factor is eliminated the constitution will of itself cease to exist. Parliamentary government will fall into contempt. The system will collapse\".\n He said of his attendance at the Stormont Parliament \"I went there of duty, not of desire\".\n In November 1945, he resigned his Belfast Central seat and retired from politics in order to take up a position as a County Court Judge.",
  "/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Northern_Ireland": "Political parties in Northern Ireland lists political parties in Northern Ireland. \nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is elected by single transferable vote and the composition of the Northern Ireland Executive is by power sharing determined by the D'Hondt system, among the members elected to the Assembly. Party affiliation is generally based on religious and ethnic background.\n Although Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, it has a quite distinct party system from the rest of the country, as the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats do not contest elections there (though the Liberal Democrats have links with the Alliance Party), and the Conservative Party has received only limited support in recent elections.\n Some parties, such as Sinn F\u00e9in and the Workers' Party, are organised on an all-Ireland basis. Others such as the Conservative Party are organised on an all-United Kingdom basis. There are many Northern Ireland-specific parties and these, on the whole, predominate.\n The distinction between \"unionist/loyalist\", \"nationalist/republican\" and \"other\" is not always easy with some parties and individuals. Some have defined themselves less by their position on the \"Border Question\" than on other political issues.\n For example, the former Republican Labour Party/Social Democratic and Labour Party MP Gerry Fitt's career suggests he was first and foremost a socialist rather than a nationalist and he eventually left the SDLP claiming it had drifted from its founding intentions. Similarly the Workers' Party has its roots in the republican Official IRA but nowadays is considered to be a non-violent socialist and nationalist party. Several parties strive to be avowedly non-sectarian and would not consider themselves to be either unionist or nationalist. The Northern Ireland Assembly requires MLAs to designate themselves either \"Unionist\", \"Nationalist\" or \"Other.\" This is a designation that is particularly resented by those who designate as \"Other\", as they have no input on who becomes First or Deputy First Minister.\n There are some who see the terms \"Unionist\" and \"Nationalist\"/\"Republican\" as being of more relevance to the community that the party seeks to represent rather than the position on the border question. Several of the \"Other\" parties strive to be non-sectarian but have a clear position on the border."
