  "/wiki/Tomislav_of_Croatia": "Tomislav (pronounced\u00a0[t\u01d2misla\u028b], Latin: Tamisclaus) was the first King of Croatia. He became Duke of Croatia in c. 910, was elevated to kingship by 925 and reigned until 928. At the time of his rule, Croatia forged an alliance with the Byzantines during their struggle with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom Croatia eventually went to war that culminated in the decisive Battle of the Bosnian Highlands in 926. To the north there were often conflicts with the Principality of Hungary. Croatia kept its borders and to some extent expanded on the disintegrated Pannonian Duchy.",
  "/wiki/Dalmatian_Croatia": "The Duchy of Croatia (Croatian: Kne\u017eevina Hrvatska; also Duchy of the Croats, Kne\u017eevina Hrvata; Dalmatian Croatia, Dalmatinska Hrvatska; Littoral Croatia, Primorska Hrvatska; Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03c9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1),[note 1] was a medieval Croatian duchy that was established in the former Roman province of Dalmatia. Throughout its time it had several seats \u2013 namely, Klis, Solin, Knin, Bija\u0107i and Nin. It comprised the littoral \u2013 the coastal part of today's Croatia \u2013, except Istria, and included a large part of the mountainous hinterland, as well. The Duchy was in the center of competition between the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire for rule over the area. Rivalry with Venice emerged in the first decades of the 9th century and was to continue for the following centuries. Croatia also waged battles with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom the relations improved greatly afterwards, and the Arabs and sought to extend its control over important coastal cities under the rule of Byzantium. Croatia experienced periods of vassalage to the Franks or Byzantines and de facto independence until 879, when Croatian Duke Branimir received recognition from Pope John VIII as an independent realm. The ruling dynasty of Croatia was the House of Trpimirovi\u0107, with interruptions by the House of Domagojevi\u0107 (864\u2013878 and 879\u2013c. 892). The Duchy existed until around 925 when, during the rule of Duke Tomislav, Croatia became a kingdom.",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Croatia_(medieval)": "The Kingdom of Croatia (Croatian: Kraljevina Hrvatska, Latin: Regnum Croatiae), or Croatian Kingdom (Croatian: Hrvatsko Kraljevstvo), was a medieval kingdom in Central Europe comprising most of what is today Croatia (without western Istria and some Dalmatian coastal cities), as well as most of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Croatian Kingdom period ruled by ethnic dynasties, the Kingdom existed as a sovereign state for nearly two centuries. Its existence was characterized by various conflicts and periods of peace or alliance with the Bulgarians, Byzantines, Hungarians, and competition with Venice for control over the eastern Adriatic coast. The goal of promoting the Croatian language in the religious service was initially brought and introduced by the 10th century bishop Gregory of Nin, which resulted in a conflict with the Pope, later to be put down by him. In the second half of the 11th century Croatia managed to secure most coastal cities of Dalmatia with the collapse of Byzantine control over them. During this time the kingdom reached its peak under the rule of kings Peter Kre\u0161imir IV (1058\u20131074) and Demetrius Zvonimir (1075\u20131089).",
