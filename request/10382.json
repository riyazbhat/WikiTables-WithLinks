  "/wiki/Tomislav_of_Croatia": "Tomislav (pronounced [t\u01d2misla\u028b], Latin: Tamisclaus) was the first King of Croatia. He became Duke of Croatia in c. 910, was elevated to kingship by 925 and reigned until 928. At the time of his rule, Croatia forged an alliance with the Byzantines during their struggle with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom Croatia eventually went to war that culminated in the decisive Battle of the Bosnian Highlands in 926. To the north there were often conflicts with the Principality of Hungary. Croatia kept its borders and to some extent expanded on the disintegrated Pannonian Duchy. Tomislav attended the Church Council of Split in 925, convened by Pope John X to discuss the use of Slavic language in liturgy and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Croatia and the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia. Although the Pope sought to prohibit Slavic liturgy, the Council did not agree, while jurisdiction was given to the Archbishop of Split instead of the Croatian Bishop Gregory of Nin. Since the historical sources about Tomislav are scarce, the exact year of his accession and his death are not known.",
  "/wiki/Dalmatian_Croatia": "The Duchy of Croatia (Croatian: Kne\u017eevina Hrvatska; also Duchy of the Croats, Kne\u017eevina Hrvata; Dalmatian Croatia, Dalmatinska Hrvatska; Littoral Croatia, Primorska Hrvatska; Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03c9\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1),[note 1] was a medieval Croatian duchy that was established in the former Roman province of Dalmatia. Throughout its time it had several seats \u2013 namely, Klis, Solin, Knin, Bija\u0107i and Nin. It comprised the littoral \u2013 the coastal part of today's Croatia \u2013, except Istria, and included a large part of the mountainous hinterland, as well. The Duchy was in the center of competition between the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire for rule over the area. Rivalry with Venice emerged in the first decades of the 9th century and was to continue for the following centuries. Croatia also waged battles with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom the relations improved greatly afterwards, and the Arabs and sought to extend its control over important coastal cities under the rule of Byzantium. Croatia experienced periods of vassalage to the Franks or Byzantines and de facto independence until 879, when Croatian Duke Branimir received recognition from Pope John VIII as an independent realm. The ruling dynasty of Croatia was the House of Trpimirovi\u0107, with interruptions by the House of Domagojevi\u0107 (864\u2013878 and 879\u2013c.",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Croatia_(medieval)": "The Kingdom of Croatia (Croatian: Kraljevina Hrvatska, Latin: Regnum Croatiae), or Croatian Kingdom (Croatian: Hrvatsko Kraljevstvo), was a medieval kingdom in Central Europe comprising most of what is today Croatia (without western Istria and some Dalmatian coastal cities), as well as most of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Croatian Kingdom period ruled by ethnic dynasties, the Kingdom existed as a sovereign state for nearly two centuries. Its existence was characterized by various conflicts and periods of peace or alliance with the Bulgarians, Byzantines, Hungarians, and competition with Venice for control over the eastern Adriatic coast. The goal of promoting the Croatian language in the religious service was initially brought and introduced by the 10th century bishop Gregory of Nin, which resulted in a conflict with the Pope, later to be put down by him. In the second half of the 11th century Croatia managed to secure most coastal cities of Dalmatia with the collapse of Byzantine control over them. During this time the kingdom reached its peak under the rule of kings Peter Kre\u0161imir IV (1058\u20131074) and Demetrius Zvonimir (1075\u20131089). The state was ruled mostly by the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty until 1091. At that point the realm experienced a succession crisis and after a decade of conflicts for the throne and the aftermath of the Battle of Gvozd Mountain, the crown passed to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty with the coronation of King Coloman of Hungary as King of Croatia and Dalmatia in Biograd in 1102, uniting the two kingdoms under one crown.",

He was a member of the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty. Michael Kre\u0161imir II was a son of Kre\u0161imir I and the younger brother of Miroslav, who preceded him as King of Croatia in 945. Kre\u0161imir was brought to the throne by the powerful Ban Pribina, who rebelled against the former king Miroslav for having his jurisdiction restrained from some areas. The civil war eventually ended with Miroslav's death in 949 and the reign of Mihajlo began. The Croatian kingdom reached its former glory during Michael's reign. He ravaged the Bosnian \u017eupa's Uskoplje, Luka and Pleva, and eventually conquered the whole region of Bosnia that was originally lost during the reign of Miroslav.

  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire": "The Holy Roman Empire (Latin: Sacrum Imperium Romanum; German: Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich), also known as Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy, plus numerous other territories, and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added. Its size gradually diminished over time, particularly from 1648 onward, and by the time of its dissolution, it largely contained only German-speaking territories (although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included), plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides. At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation. On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe, more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476. The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, Berengar I, in 924. The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning.",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary": "The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the 20th century (1000\u20131946 with the exception of 1918\u20131920). The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom around the year 1000; his family (the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty) led the monarchy for 300 years. By the 12th century, the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world. Due to the Ottoman occupation of the central and southern territories of Hungary in the 16th century, the country was partitioned into three parts: the Habsburg Royal Hungary, Ottoman Hungary, and the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania. The House of Habsburg held the Hungarian throne after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs until 1918 and also played a key role in the liberation wars against the Ottoman Empire. From 1867, territories connected to the Hungarian crown were incorporated into Austria-Hungary under the name of Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. The monarchy ended with the deposition of the last king Charles IV in 1918, after which Hungary became a republic. The kingdom was nominally restored during the Regency of 1920\u201346, ending under the Soviet occupation in 1946.",
