It was the only race of the 1984 championship that was run on a wet track.\n During practice, Tyrrell's Martin Brundle had a huge crash at the Tabac corner. He landed upside down and was slightly injured, but it was enough to make him a non-qualifier for the race. Brundle later told that he ran back to the pits but was not allowed to get into the spare car as it was discovered he could not actually remember how he returned to the pits. Formula One medical chief, Prof. Sid Watkins concluded Brundle was slightly concussed and the decision was made not to let him return to the track."
