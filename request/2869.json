  "/wiki/Rajah_Sulayman": "Rajah Sulayman, sometimes referred to as Sulayman III (Sanskrit: \u0938\u094d\u0932\u0932\u0948\u0905\u0939\u094d , Baybayin: \u1710\u1713\u170e\u170c\u1714\u170b\u1708\u1714, Abecedario: Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n) (1558\u20131575), was the Rajah or paramount ruler of the Rajahnate of Maynila, a fortified Tagalog Muslim polity which was a vassal to the Brunei Sultanate, on the southern half of the Pasig River delta, by the time Spanish colonizers arrived in the early 1570s.\n Sulayman - along with his co-ruler Rajah Matanda of Maynila and Lakan Dula, who ruled the neighboring polity of Tondo - was one of three monarchs who figured most significantly in the Spanish conquest of the Port of Manila and the Pasig River delta.  Spanish accounts describe him as the most aggressive of the three rulers \u2013 a characteristic chalked up to his youth relative to the other two rulers.\n He was penultimate indigenous paramount ruler (Rajah) in the Pasig River Delta era: his adoptive son, baptized Agustin de Legaspi upon conversion to Christianity, was proclaimed Paramount ruler of Tondo upon the death of Lakan Dula, but he, along with most of Lakan Dula's sons and most of Sulayman's adoptive sons were executed by the Spanish after being implicated in the 1587\u20131588 Tondo Conspiracy, helping the Spanish Empire to further solidify its grip on Luzon and most of the Philippine archipelago.",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Maynila": "In early Philippine history, the Tagalog Bayan (country or polity) of Maynila (Filipino: Bayan ng Maynila; Baybayin: \u170a\u170c\u1708\u1714 \u1705\u1714 \u170b\u170c\u1714\u1708\u1712\u170e; Kapampangan: Balen ning Menila) was a major trade hub located on the southern part of the Pasig River delta, where the modern day district of Intramuros currently stands. Historical texts indicate that it was led by paramount rulers who used the title Rajah, but the introduction of hispanized literary forms have led to it sometimes being inappropriately referred to as the Kingdom of Maynila. Some early historic texts also refer to it as the Kingdom of Luzon, although scholarship suggests that the latter term might actually refer to the Manila Bay region as a whole, rather than just Maynila. The earliest oral traditions suggest that Maynila was founded as a Muslim principality as early as the 1250s, supplanting an even older pre-Muslim settlement. However, the earliest archeological evidence for organized human settlements in the area dates to around 1500. By the 16th century, it had become an important trading center, with extensive political ties with the Sultanate of Brunei and extensive trade relations with Ming dynasty. Together with Tondo, the polity (bayan) on the northern part of the Pasig River delta, it established a shared monopoly on the trade of Chinese goods. Maynila and Luzon are sometimes associated with the Bruneian legends which describe a settlement called Seludong, but Southeast Asian scholars believe this refers to a settlement Mount Selurong in Indonesia.",
