Dixon had been named head coach just 11 days before the start of the season but led the Black Knights to a 20\u201311 record and won the Patriot League tournament championship. It was Army's first basketball team, men or women, to play in the NCAA Tournament.

On April 6, 2006, Dixon died at the age of 28 to what her brother Jamie Dixon, then head men's basketball coach at Pittsburgh, described as an \"arrhythmic episode to her heart.\""
