The party's platform is generally conservative, which involves supporting free market capitalism. One of several continuing factions of the original Muslim League, the seeds of the party were sown following the 1985 Elections when the Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Khan Junejo organised the supporters of President Zia-ul-Haq's dictatorship into a single party, known as the Pakistan Muslim League. After President Zia's death in 1988, under the leadership of Fida Mohammad Khan, a large faction split away from the Junejo-led Pakistan Muslim League, and formed a conservative alliance with various right-wing and Islamist political parties, called the Islamic Democratic Alliance. The alliance formed a government in 1990 under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif.",

  "/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_14th_National_Assembly_of_Pakistan": "The 14th National Assembly of Pakistan was the legislature of Pakistan following the 2013 general election of members of parliament (MPs) to the National Assembly of Pakistan, the lower house of the bicameral Majlis-e-Shura. The National Assembly is a democratically elected body consisting of 342 members, who are referred to as Members of the National Assembly (MNAs), of which 272 are directly elected members; 70 reserved seats for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportion of the total vote. The election saw each of Parliament's 272 geographical constituencies return one MP to the National Assembly. It resulted in a Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) majority, and a massive loss of seats for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PML-N became the single largest party, though without an overall majority. The PML-N won 163 seats in the National Assembly. This resulted in a hung parliament. A coalition agreement was formed following negotiations with independent candidates who joined the PML-N, allowing the party to form a simple majority government by bringing on-board nineteen independent candidates, thirteen more than the minimum required to form a government."
