  "/wiki/List_of_hydroelectric_power_station_failures": "This is a list of major hydroelectric power station failures due to damage to a hydroelectric power station or its connections.  Every generating station trips from time to time due to minor defects and can usually be restarted when the defect has been remedied. Various protections are built into the stations to cause shutdown before major damage is caused. Some hydroelectric power station failures may go beyond the immediate loss of generation capacity, including destruction of the turbine itself, reservoir breach and significant destruction of national grid infrastructure downstream.  These can take years to remedy in some cases."
