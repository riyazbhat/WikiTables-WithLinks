  "/wiki/Henry_Jermyn,_1st_Baron_Dover": "Henry Jermyn, 3rd Baron Jermyn and 1st Baron Dover, 1st Jacobite Earl of Dover PC (c. 1636\u20131708) was an English peer and supporter of James II.\n Jermyn was the second son of Sir Thomas Jermyn, of Rushbrooke, Suffolk, who died in 1659, and his wife Rebecca Rodway, who married secondly Henry, 3rd Viscount Brouncker.   He surpassed his uncle, Lord St Albans, in reputation for profligacy, figuring frequently as \"the little Jermyn\" in the Grammont Memoirs, as the lover of Lady Castlemaine, Lady Shrewsbury, Miss Jennings and other beauties of the court of Charles II of England.\n According to rumour his most notable conquest was Charles's widowed sister Mary of Orange, whom he met several times during her brother's exile,   and there were even stories that they were secretly married. Historians generally discount these rumours, but Charles II took them seriously, and reprimanded his sister for her lack of discretion,  but with no effect: Mary sharply reminded her brother that his own love affairs hardly entitled him to judge her moral conduct.  Charles was especially angry because of the similar rumours that Jermyn's  uncle Lord  St Albans had secretly married the Queen Dowager Henrietta Maria. As John Phillipps Kenyon remarked,  to have one Jermyn as  an in-law would have been  bad enough; to have  two would be intolerable.\n He was  a noted duelist and a lifelong gambler. In a notorious duel  with Colonel Thomas Howard, (younger brother of  Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle),   in  August 1662, which Samuel Pepys  refers to in his Diary,  Jermyn  was left for dead. He recovered, but his second  Giles  Rawlings  was killed by Howard's second Colonel Carey Dillon,  later  the 5th Earl of Roscommon: the cause is said to have been  the rivalry  between Jermyn and Howard for the affections of Lady Shrewsbury, who was notorious for the number of her lovers.\n While the court was in exile, he obtained a post in the household of the Duke of York, despite the strong disapproval of Charles II, and he became James's  master of the horse at the English Restoration, and rode a horse at the Coronation of Charles II. Having previously offended the king by courting his sister  Mary, he proceeded  to give further offence by having an affair with Lady Castlemaine, by then the chief royal mistress, and he was banished from court for six months.\n Being a Roman Catholic, he enjoyed a position of influence with James, who on his accession raised Jermyn to the Peerage of England in 1685 as Baron Dover in the county of Kent, and appointed him Lieutenant-General of the Royal Guard in 1686. He was one of the first Catholics to be admitted to the Privy Council of England. Despite his debauched private life, as a politician he was a  moderate and sensible influence on the king. While his loyalty was never in question, he was not afraid to speak his mind to James, or to  disagree with him in public.\n At the Glorious Revolution, Dover adhered to James, whom he followed abroad, and in July 1689 the deposed sovereign created him Baron Jermyn of Royston, Baron Ipswich, Viscount Cheveley and Earl of Dover in the Jacobite Peerage, these titles not being recognised by the English Government, though Dover became generally known as the Earl of Dover. He commanded a troop at the Battle of the Boyne, but shortly afterwards made his submission to King William III.  He spent the rest of his life living quietly at his London townhouse, or at his country estate Cheveley, near Newmarket. He succeeded his brother Thomas as 3rd Baron Jermyn in 1703, and died in 1708. As he left no children by his wife, Judith, daughter of Sir Edmund Poley, of Badley, Suffolk, his titles became extinct at his death.",

  "/wiki/Duke_of_Perth": "Earl of Perth is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1605 for James Drummond, 4th Lord Drummond. The Drummond family claim descent from Maurice, son of George, a younger son of King Andrew I of Hungary. Maurice arrived in Scotland on the ship which brought Edgar \u00c6theling, the Saxon claimant to the crown of England after the Norman Conquest, and his sister Margaret to Scotland in 1068. Maurice was given lands in Lennox (Dunbartonshire), together with the hereditary stewardship of the county. The Hungarian Prince theory has been discounted as no evidence of any relationships exists in written records.  \"The Red Book of the Menteiths\" clearly discounts the Hungarian Prince as a myth likely formed to give status to the Drummond origins. The Drummonds in the 12th Century were allied to the Menteiths their early fortunes became through the relationship.  Indeed, one \"Johannes De Drumon\", said to have died in 1301, was buried in Inchmahome Priory which was founded by the Menteiths.   His successor John Drummond, the 7th Steward, was deprived of the lands and retired into Perthshire.\n John Drummond, Justiciar of Scotia, was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Drummond of Cargill in 1487/8 by King James III of Scotland. His direct descendant, James, 4th Lord Drummond, Ambassador to Spain, was created Earl of Perth and Lord Drummond of Stobhall in 1605.\n James Drummond, 4th Earl of Perth was attainted for supporting the Jacobites during the rising of 1715. He had been created Duke of Perth, Marquess of Drummond, Earl of Stobhall, Viscount Cargill, and Lord Concraig in 1701 by the exiled Jacobite claimant to the British thrones, recognised by adherents of the Royal Stuarts as King James III and VIII. This creation, in the Jacobite Peerage, was never recognised by the de facto British government. He and his successors nonetheless continued to claim the Earldom together with the Dukedom. Upon the death of the sixth Duke in 1760, he was succeeded by a second cousin, descended from the younger brother of the 4th Earl and 1st Jacobite Duke, John Drummond, first Earl and Jacobite Duke of Melfort, by his first wife. He, in turn, was succeeded by his third but only surviving son, as the 8th (Jacobite) Duke and 11th de jure Earl, who obtained in 1783 the restoration of the estates, forfeited as a result of the Jacobite rising of 1745. He did not succeed, however, in removing the attainder of 1716, but was created by George III of the Hanoverian dynasty, in 1797, Lord Perth, Baron Drummond of Stobhall, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which title became extinct on his death in 1800. He was succeeded, as 9th Jacobite Duke of Perth by his cousin, James Lewis Drummond, fourth Duke of Melfort, another holder of a Jacobite dukedom. The 10th Duke, who also held the Melfort titles, was a prelate of Roman Catholic Church, known as the Abb\u00e9 de Melfort. Upon his death in 1840, he was succeeded in his peerage titles by his nephew, George Drummond, who had embraced the Protestant faith.\n In 1853, the sixth Duke of Melfort, George Drummond, was by Act of Parliament deemed the 5th Earl of Perth, and the previous attainder was reversed. Drummond also dropped the use of the dukedom of Melfort, although he had been recognised in French law courts as the duc de Melfort, comte de Lussan and baron de Valrose. At his death in 1902, several titles held by him, such as the Earldom of Melfort, became dormant because no-one could prove a claim to the title. The Earldom of Perth, however, as well as the titular Jacobite Dukedom, passed to William Huntly Drummond, 11th Viscount Strathallan (his 7th cousin twice removed, a descendant of the 2nd Lord Drummond). Because some writers do not count the de jure holders of the Earldom in the numbering, the 14th Earl is sometimes referred to as the 5th Earl, and so on. The present Earl of Perth considers himself the 18th holder of the title.\n The subsidiary titles held by the Earl of Perth are: Viscount Strathallan (created 1686), Lord Drummond of Cargill (1488), Lord Drummond of Stobhall (1605), Lord Maderty (1609) and Lord Drummond of Cromlix (1686). The title Viscount Strathallan is the courtesy title of the Earl's eldest son and heir.

  "/wiki/John_Caryll_(senior)": "John Caryll (1625\u20131711), 1st Baron Caryll of Durford in the Jacobite Peerage, was a poet, dramatist, and diplomat; not to be confused with his nephew, John Caryll the younger, the dedicatee of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock.\n Caryll was born at West Harting in Sussex, England.  He was head of an old English Catholic and Royalist family at that time settled in West Harting, in Sussex. His father, of whom he was heir, was likewise named John; his mother was a daughter of William, second Baron Petre. Of his education he received part at the English College of St. Omer, in Artois, part at the Venerable English College in Rome. During the reign of Charles II of England he produced several plays and poems. In poetry his chief performances were a translation of Ovid's Epistle of Brise\u00efs to Achilles, first appearing in 1680 in a work entitled Ovid's Epistles, translated by several hands, and afterwards separately; also a translation of Virgil's first Eclogue, printed in Nichol's Select Collection of Miscellany Poems and published in 1683.\n His plays, both of them brought out at the Duke of York's Theatre, were a tragedy written in 1666 and called The English Princess, or the death of Richard III (Samuel Pepys, who saw this piece acted 7 March 1667, found it no more than \"pretty good\"), and a comedy entitled Sir Solomon Single, or the Cautious Coxcomb, which came out in 1671, upon the pattern of Moli\u00e8re's The School for Wives. In 1679, during the so-called \"Popish Plot\", Caryll, as a Catholic of distinction, was committed to the Tower of London, but was soon let out on bail. When James II of England succeeded to the throne in 1685, he sent Caryll as his agent to the court of Pope Innocent XI, withdrawing him some months later upon the Earl of Castlemaine's appointment to that post.\n Caryll was then appointed secretary to Mary of Modena, queen of James II, in whose service he continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when he followed the exiled royal family across the sea to Saint-Germain. From his voluntary expatriation, however, there ensued no confiscation of his property until 1696, when, by reason of his implication in one of the plots to overthrow William of Orange (William III), he having furnished money for that purpose, his estate in West Harting was declared forfeited. His life interest in West Harting was thereon granted to Lord Cutts, but redeemed by Caryll's aforementioned nephew for \u00a36,000. In exile at Saint-Germain, he was created by the dethroned James II (d. 1701) Baron Caryll of Durford (or Dunford) in West Sussex and appointed his Joint Secretary of State together with Charles Middleton, 2nd Earl of Middleton from 1694 to 1696.\n His son, the so-called Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, recognised by Jacobites as \"King James III and VIII\" re-appointed him one of his Secretaries of State, a post which he continued to hold up until his death. Meanwhile, in 1700, Caryll published anonymously another work, this time in prose, entitled The Psalmes of David, translated from the Vulgat. He died 4 September 1711, and was buried at Paris in the church of the Scots College, of which he had been a benefactor and where there was set up a tablet to his memory. He married Margaret, a daughter and co-heir of Sir Maurice Drummond. She died in 1656. They left no children, and by a special remainder, he was succeeded in his Jacobite peerage, by his nephew, also named John Caryll. One of his sisters, Mary, became first abbess of the English Benedictine nuns in Dunkirk. The last of the Caryll in Europe, a grandson of the above-mentioned nephew, died at Dunkirk in 1788, having served as Secretary to Charles Edward Stuart, called \"the Young Pretender\", known by Jacobites as \"King Charles III\"; his younger son moved to the USA and settled in Chicago.\n The Baron of Caryll of Durford (or Dunford) descendants live today in the USA.

She continued to reign as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death in 1714.\n Anne was born in the reign of Charles II to his younger brother and heir presumptive, James, whose suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England. On Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Mary married their Dutch Protestant cousin, William III of Orange, in 1677, and Anne married Prince George of Denmark in 1683. On Charles's death in 1685, James succeeded to the throne, but just three years later he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Mary and William became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.\n During her reign, Anne favoured moderate Tory politicians, who were more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of political differences.
