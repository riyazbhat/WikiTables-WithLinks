The World Health Organization (WHO) rates it as a Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring biosafety level 4-equivalent containment). In the United States, the NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ranks it as a Category A Priority Pathogen and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists it as a Category A Bioterrorism Agent. It is also listed as a biological agent for export control by the Australia Group.",
  "/wiki/Paramyxoviridae": "Paramyxoviridae  is a family of viruses in the order Mononegavirales. Vertebrates serve as natural hosts; no known plants serve as vectors. Currently, 72 species are placed in this family, divided among 14 genera. Diseases associated with this negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus family include measles, mumps, and respiratory tract infections.",
  "/wiki/Measles_virus": "Measles morbillivirus, formerly called measles virus (MeV), is a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped, non-segmented RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae.  It is the cause of measles. Humans are the natural hosts of the virus; no animal reservoirs are known to exist.",
  "/wiki/Mumps_virus": "Mumps rubulavirus is the causative agent of mumps.   The signs of mumps include swelling of the parotid glands, salivary glands and other epithelial tissues. Symptoms of mumps are fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of appetite, low grade fever, swelling of the salivary glands. Mumps can also result in muscle pain, deafness, meningitis, pancreatitis, swelling of testicles or ovaries, and death.  Most people who contract mumps show symptoms of the virus, however there are few who show no or very few symptoms. Natural infection is currently restricted to humans and the virus is transmitted by direct contact, droplet spread, or contaminated objects.",
  "/wiki/Parainfluenza_virus": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are the viruses that cause human parainfluenza. HPIVs are a paraphyletic group of four distinct single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are closely associated with both human and veterinary disease. Virions are approximately 150\u2013250\u00a0nm in size and contain negative sense RNA with a genome encompassing about 15,000 nucleotides.",
  "/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus": "Human orthopneumovirus (also known as human respiratory syncytial virus, or HRSV) is a syncytial virus that causes respiratory tract infections. It is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. A prophylactic medication, palivizumab, can be employed to prevent HRSV in preterm (under 35 weeks gestation) infants, infants with certain congenital heart defects (CHD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and infants with congenital malformations of the airway. Treatment is limited to supportive care, including oxygen therapy and more advanced breathing support with CPAP or nasal high flow oxygen, as required.",
  "/wiki/Viral_disease": "A viral disease (or viral infection, or infectious disease) occurs when an organism's body is invaded by pathogenic viruses, and infectious virus particles (virions) attach to and enter susceptible cells."
