It is the main route serving Blackburn Hamlet and south Orleans, as well as several industrial and commercial areas in east Ottawa. This road has changed considerably over the years.\n The western section from St. Laurent Boulevard to Cyrville Road is a four-lane principal arterial road that primarily runs through industrial and light commercial areas with partial access control, although with an 80 km/h (50 mph) speed limit. Some residential frontage and considerable commercial frontage exists in the fairly congested section east of Highway 417, where Innes widens to six lanes up to Blackburn Hamlet and then becomes a divided four-lane road.  The Canadian Conservation Institute is located in this section.\n Innes splits in Blackburn Hamlet; The original alignment runs through the community as an undivided road with a lower speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph). On both stretches of road, it is very common to get caught by speed traps.[citation needed] The 3.3 km (2.1 mi) long Blackburn Bypass (Ottawa Road 128) was built in the late 1980s; it is a divided expressway around Blackburn Hamlet maintaining 80 km/h (50 mph), greatly speeding up the commute to Orl\u00e9ans.\n Once in Orl\u00e9ans, Innes once again becomes a commercial/mixed frontage principal arterial road. This was recently widened from two to four lanes due to the urban sprawl of south Orleans. The most congested section is at 10th Line Road, which has become the second commercial hub of Orleans (after Place d'Orleans). The speed limit through Orleans is 60 km/h (37 mph) although during the construction project it was reduced mostly to 50 km/h (31 mph).\n Once clear of Orl\u00e9ans (east of Frank Kenny Road), Innes becomes a rural road.",

This was precipitated by the extension of the Hunt Club Road west across the Rideau River creating a new intersection with Merivale Road in what used to be a rural farming field.  This area includes various national retailers such as Canadian Tire, Petsmart, Rona, Costco and the Brick as well as various restaurant chains such as Boston Pizza and Eastside Mario's, fast food places such as Burger King and A&W, car dealerships, workout gyms and smaller specialty stores.\n South of Hunt Club Road, Merivale runs through an industrial district with many small businesses which during the 1970s and 1980s was the second location for intense industrial development led by the City of Nepean.

  "/wiki/Alta_Vista_Ward": "Alta Vista Ward (Ward 18) is a city ward in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada represented on Ottawa City Council. Alta Vista Ward was created prior to the 1966 election when Gloucester Ward was split in half due to population growth in the Alta Vista area. Until the 1972 elections, the ward was represented by two councillors (then called aldermen). Prior to the 1980 election, the Ward was split in half, with the western half remaining as Alta Vista ward and the eastern half became Canterbury Ward. They were reunited prior to the  1994 Election and was known as Alta Vista-Canterbury Ward. During this time, on regional council it was known as just Alta Vista Ward. It was renamed to Alta Vista in 2000.\n The ward is located in Ottawa's southeast end, and covers the neighbourhoods of Eastway Gardens, Riverview, Alta Vista, Heron Gate and Sheffield Glen. The Ward is often advertised by candidates as \"Alta Vista-Canterbury-Riverview.\" The ward covers an area of 20.3 km2. There is only a small boundary change for the 2006 election: the boundary will follow Highway 417 instead of the old city limits from Walkley north to the CPR right-of-way.\n Until 2014, the ward was represented by Peter Hume. He defeated incumbent Allan Higdon in the 2000 election. It was a battle of incumbents, as Hume was a regional councillor until the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton was abolished. Jean Cloutier replaced Hume in 2014.\n Key issues affecting the Alta Vista ward since 2000 have been: the proposed Alta Vista transportation corridor, the fate of the Canada Science and Technology Museum, as well as the O-Train expansion.",
  "/wiki/Alta_Vista_Drive": "Alta Vista Drive is a suburban road in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from Bank Street in the south to Industrial Avenue in the north covering the neighbourhoods of Ridgemont, Alta Vista and Riverview.\n Alta Vista was created as the result of major residential developments (notably the Rideau Park and Alta Vista subdivisions) in the region following World War II. First referred to as the \"100 foot highway\", was renamed Churchill Avenue (after Winston Churchill) in 1941. It became \"Alta Vista Drive\" in July 1950 as the result of Ottawa annexing that part of Gloucester Township (there was already a Churchill Avenue in Ottawa). The first stretch was built between Smyth Road and Kilborn Avenue in 1939. Gloucester Township Council passed a by-law on May 3, 1937 permitting its construction. The stretch from Kilborn to Randall was built in 1940; the stretch north of Smyth in 1942 (to what is now Terminal Avenue) and south of Randall to Bank Street (then called \"Metcalfe Road\") in 1947.\n Alta Vista originally ran past Industrial and connected with the Vanier Parkway, but the intersection, which also involved Riverside Drive was re-aligned in 1986. Furthermore, in the 1990s, Alta Vista gained bicycle lanes along its entire stretch. Alta Vista is so named for its general height, as the neighbourhoods it runs through are generally higher than the rest of the city (the name means \"a view from above\" or \"high view\" in Spanish and Portuguese). The name was first applied to the area in 1913, for a small subdivision built on the north side of Randall Avenue which had a good view of Parliament Hill.\n For the most part, Alta Vista runs through residential areas, and it is a two to four-lane minor arterial road, with a speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph). The area consists mostly of single-home houses, with the exception of three apartment-style, low-rent buildings named the \"Alta Vista Towers\" located in the north near Industrial Avenue and the Alta Vista Plaza. Alta Vista Drive consists of mixed housing, ranging from small modest houses in the northern parts, to more expensive, small Colonial-style houses and bungalows in the area immediately south to Smyth Road.\n The road is characterized by large trees along both sides and the Via Rail train track running parallel between Alta Vista Drive and Riverside Drive from Industrial Avenue to Smyth Road.\n Alta Vista is home to the National Defence Medical Centre, Canadian Pharmacists Association, Canadian Blood Services, Canadian Dental Association, Ontario Medical Association, the Canadian Medical Association, and its affiliate MD Management, and the Conference Board of Canada, located in the area north of the Smyth Road intersection in a stretch of the road that is not residential, as well as Ridgemont High School and St. Patrick's High School located south from Smyth Road. The area is home to the Anglican Church St. Thomas the Apostle, the United Church Rideau Park, and the Presbyterian Church St. Timothy's. There is one branch of the Ottawa Library and two shopping centres, one being at the northern-most stretch near Industrial Avenue, and the other at the southern-most section abutting Bank Street.",
