It runs through some lightly populated regions along the state's southern border, from Central New York to the Catskills. It begins near a busy intersection with Interstate\u00a081 (I-81) at Whitney Point and runs east from there through Greene. The eastern terminus is located at a junction with NY\u00a017 (future I-86) at Roscoe in Sullivan County. It is one of the longest three-digit routes in New York, and the only long one not associated with a two-digit route or a former U.S. Route. Yet due to its location it sees little traffic, although for much of its length it follows the route of a main 19th century thoroughfare, the Catskill Turnpike. It is primarily a long shortcut around Binghamton.\n NY\u00a0206 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but only from Bainbridge to Downsville. NY\u00a0206 was extended west to Whitney Point in the early 1940s; another extension in the late 1970s moved the route's eastern terminus to Roscoe. Prior to becoming NY\u00a0206, the Whitney Point\u2013Greene segment was once New York State Route\u00a0219 and New York State Route\u00a0383 while the portion from Coventry to Bainbridge was previously New York State Route\u00a0218.",

Outside of the communities, the route serves largely rural areas of the state and traverses the Catskill Mountains in the state's Central New York Region.

At the time, the route extended from Oneonta to Massachusetts and followed a slightly different alignment from Cairo to Claverack via Hudson that took the route along modern County Route\u00a023B (CR\u00a023B) in eastern Greene County. NY\u00a023 was extended west to Norwich in the mid-1920s and to NY\u00a026 in northwestern Chenango County in 1930.

The northern terminus is at NY\u00a037 near the village of Morristown in the North Country. In between, the route serves three cities of varying size: Norwich, Utica, and Watertown. The distance between Utica and Binghamton is a major trucking route, and features many gas stations, truck stops, and fast food restaurants. Between Boonville and Lowville, it follows the Black River Valley and between Watertown and Morristown, it follows the St. Lawrence River valley.\n It is a two lane, undivided, full access roadway for the majority of its length, except between the village of New Hartford and Alder Creek, where it is a four-lane highway.
