Noles pitched the next 4\u200b2\u20443 innings and gave up another run, but is most remembered for throwing a fastball under George Brett's chin in the fourth inning that prompted a warning by the umpires to both teams. Brett struck out in the at-bat and had only three singles and one RBI the remainder of the series. The brushback incident is looked upon as the turning point in that series for the Phillies.\n Before the 1982 season, Noles was traded along with Keith Moreland to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Krukow and cash. Noles had an effective season as a starter in 1982, going 10\u201313. In early 1983, however, Noles' alcohol problems began to surface.

Following the 2004 season, the franchise relocated to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals.\n Immediately after the minor league Triple-A Montreal Royals folded in 1960, political leaders in Montreal sought an MLB franchise, and when the National League evaluated expansion candidates for the 1969 season, it awarded a team to Montreal. Named after the Expo 67 World's Fair, the Expos originally played at Jarry Park Stadium before moving to Olympic Stadium in 1977. The Expos failed to post a winning record in any of their first ten seasons. The team won its only division title in the strike-shortened 1981 season, but lost the 1981 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Los Angeles Dodgers.

He led the team to four winning seasons, including 1994, where the Expos had the best record in baseball before a players' strike ended the season. Alou became the Expos leader in games managed (1,409).\n The aftermath of the 1994 strike initiated a downward spiral as the Expos chose to sell off their best players, and attendance and interest in the team declined. Following a failed attempt to disband the Expos, Major League Baseball purchased the team prior to the 2002 season after the club failed to secure funding for a new ballpark.

In 2009, they moved into their current ballpark, Citi Field.\n In their inaugural season, the Mets posted a record of 40\u2013120, the worst regular season record since MLB went to a 162-game schedule. The team never finished better than second-to-last until the \"Miracle Mets\" beat the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series, one of the biggest upsets in World Series history. Since then, they have played in four World Series, including a dramatic run in 1973 that ended in a seven-game loss to the Oakland Athletics, a second championship in 1986 over the Boston Red Sox, a Subway Series loss against their cross-town rivals the New York Yankees in 2000, and a five-game loss to the Kansas City Royals in 2015.\n The Mets qualified to play in the MLB postseason in 1988 and 2006, coming within one game of the World Series both years. After near-misses in 2007 and 2008, the team made the playoffs in 2015 for the first time in nine years, and won their first NL pennant in 15 years. The team again returned to the playoffs in 2016, this time with a wild card berth. This was the team's second back-to-back playoff appearance, the first occurring during the 1999 and 2000 seasons.\n At the end of the 2019 season, the team's overall win-loss record was 4448\u20134808, a .481 win percentage.",
