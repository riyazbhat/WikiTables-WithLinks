  "/wiki/Bridge_School_(Michigan)": "The Bridge School is a former educational facility in rural Raisinville Township in Monroe County, Michigan. The building is located at 96 Ida-Maybee Road just north of M-50 on the formerly designated M-130 near the River Raisin. The Bridge School is recognized as the first public school in Michigan when it was founded in 1828. It was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site on December 17, 1982. As of 2010, it serves as the township hall and seat of government for Raisinville Township. In 1828, the earliest settlers in the area organized a public school district to provide a basic education for their children. The new district would receive funding from the government of the Michigan Territory and is recognized as the first district of its kind in the territory that later became the state of Michigan in 1837. In the same year as its founding, the district built a small log schoolhouse, and the district's name came from the nearby Bruckner Bridge that had just been constructed over the River Raisin. A larger school, constructed from walnut trees, replaced the log structure in 1832. The present brick building was constructed in its place in 1868 and received an addition in 1910. On June 23, 1928, the school dedicated an obelisk in front of the building to commemorate the district's centennial. The Bridge School served as the area's only public school district from 1828-1950.",
  "/wiki/Monroe,_Michigan": "Monroe is the largest city and county seat of Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Monroe had a population of 20,733 in the 2010 census. Located on the western shores of Lake Erie, the city is bordered on the south by Monroe Charter Township, but the two are administered autonomously. Monroe is located approximately 14 miles (23 km) north of Toledo, Ohio and 25 miles (40 km) south of Detroit. The U.S. Census Bureau lists Monroe as the core city in the Monroe Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is conterminous with Monroe County and had a population of 152,021 in 2010. Monroe is officially part of the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint combined statistical area. The Monroe area was the scene of several military conflicts during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom and is best remembered for the Battle of Frenchtown. In 1817, portions of the Frenchtown settlement along the River Raisin were platted and renamed Monroe after then-president James Monroe. When Michigan became a state in 1837, Monroe was incorporated as a city. Monroe is known as the childhood residence of George Armstrong Custer and other members of his family, including his brother Boston Custer and wife Elizabeth Bacon. Several structures are named after Custer, including Custer Airport. The city also contains numerous other historic structures.",
  "/wiki/George_Armstrong_Custer_Equestrian_Monument": "The George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument, also known as Sighting the Enemy, is an equestrian statue of General George Armstrong Custer located in Monroe, Michigan. The statue was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on June 15, 1992 and soon after listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1994. While Custer was not born in Monroe, he lived much of his early childhood there with relatives and attended the schools in Monroe. During his youth, he met his future wife Elizabeth Bacon, whom he returned to marry in 1864. Custer left Monroe to attend the United States Military Academy and fight in the Civil War. Because of his hard work and success during the war - as well as the Union's need for officers - he was promoted to the rank of Major General and became a very well-known military figure. After the Civil War, he fought in the Indian Wars in the West. His previous accomplishments in the Civil War, however, were overshadowed by his catastrophic defeat and death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. To honor him, a $24,000, 14-foot (4.27 m) bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by Edward Clark Potter, was unveiled in Monroe in June 1910 by President William Howard Taft and the widowed Elizabeth Bacon Custer. The statue commemorates his successful actions during the Civil War and not his more well-known defeat in 1876.",

  "/wiki/Lake_Erie": "Lake Erie /\u02c8\u026a\u0259ri/ (French: Lac \u00c9ri\u00e9) is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the eleventh-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet (64 metres) deep. Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States, Lake Erie's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario, specifically the Ontario Peninsula, with the U.S. states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its western, southern, and eastern shores. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native American people who lived along its southern shore. The tribal name erie is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word erielhonan, meaning long tail. Situated below Lake Huron, Erie's primary inlet is the Detroit River. The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River, which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston, New York and Queenston, Ontario. Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal, part of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne, Ontario on Lake Erie, to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario, an elevation difference of 326 ft (99 m). Lake Erie's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades, with issues such as overfishing, pollution, algae blooms, and eutrophication generating headlines.",

  "/wiki/Southern_Railroad_(Michigan)": "Railroads have been vital in the history of the population and trade of rough and finished goods in the state of Michigan. While some coastal settlements had previously existed, the population, commercial, and industrial growth of the state further bloomed with the establishment of the railroad. The state's proximity to Ontario, Canada aided the transport of goods in a smooth east-west trajectory from the eastern shore of Lake Michigan toward Montreal and Quebec.

The Navarre-Anderson complex was established by the early French settlers Francois Navarre and John Anderson, who were among the first to settle the area of present-day Monroe. In addition to the main building, which also served as a house, the cookhouse building was built in 1810. The original barn is no longer standing, but a 1790s replica was built on the complex. The complex was originally located several miles downstream in the present-day Old Village Historic District. When advancing development threatened this historical complex, it was moved in 1894 and again in 1971. The complex was restored back to its appearance from what it looked like 1799.
