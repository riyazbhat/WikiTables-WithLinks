Kozhikode was one of the important trading ports on the south-western coast of India. At the peak of their reign, the Samoothiri's ruled over a region from Kollam (Quilon) to Panthalayini Kollam (Koyilandy).\n It was after the dissolution of the kingdom of Cheras of Cranganore (Kodungallur) in the early 12th century, the Samoothiris \u2013 originally autonomous chiefs of Eranadu \u2013 demonstrated their political independence. The Samoothiris maintained elaborate trade relations with the Muslim Middle-Eastern sailors in the Indian Ocean, the primary spice traders on the Malabar Coast in the Middle Ages. Kozhikode was then an important entrep\u00f4t in south-western India where Chinese and West Asian trade met.\n The Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama visited the Kozhikode in 1498, opening the sailing route directly from Europe to Asia. The Portuguese efforts to lay the foundations to Estado da \u00cdndia, and to take complete control over the commerce was repeatedly hampered by the forces of Samoothiri of Kozhikode. The Kunjali Marakkars, the famous Muslim warriors, were the naval chiefs of Kozhikode. By the end of the 16th century the Portuguese \u2013 now commanding the spice traffic on the Malabar Coast \u2013 had succeeded in replacing the Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea. The Dutch supplanted the Portuguese in the 17th century, only to be followed by the English.\n In 1766 Haider Ali of Mysore defeated the Samoothiri of Kozhikode \u2013 an English East India Company dependant at the time \u2013 and absorbed Kozhikode to his state. After the Third Mysore War (1790\u20131792), Malabar was placed under the control of the Company.
