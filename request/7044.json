  "/wiki/Species": "In biology, a species (/\u02c8spi\u02d0\u0283i\u02d0z/ (listen)) is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism, as well as a unit of biodiversity. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour or ecological niche. In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined. The total number of species is estimated to be between 8 and 8.7 million. However the vast majority of them are not studied or documented and it may take over 1000 years to fully catalog all of them. All species (except viruses) are given a two-part name, a binomial. The first part of a binomial is the genus to which the species belongs.",
  "/wiki/Family_(biology)": "Family (Latin: familia, plural familiae) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy; it is classified between order and genus. A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as being the walnut family.\n What does or does not belong to a family\u2014or whether a described family should be recognized at all\u2014are proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists. There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family. Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions, and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time. The publishing of new data and opinions often enables adjustments and consensus.",
  "/wiki/Aquatic_layer": "The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be further divided into regions by depth. The word pelagic is derived from Ancient Greek  \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (p\u00e9lagos), meaning 'open sea'. The pelagic zone can be thought of in terms of an imaginary cylinder or water column that goes from the surface of the sea almost to the bottom. Conditions in the water column change with distance from the surface (depth): the pressure increases; the temperature and amount of light decreases; the salinity and amount of dissolved oxygen, as well as micronutrients such as iron, magnesium and calcium, all change. Rather like the Earth's atmosphere, but  depending on how deep the water is, the water column can be divided vertically into up to five different layers, as illustrated on the right. In addition to the above changes, marine life is affected by underwater topography, which is called bathymetry, by the proximity of land that is underwater such as the seafloor or a shoreline or a submarine seamount. Marine life is also affected by the proximity of the ocean surface, the boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere, which can bring light for photosynthesis but can also bring predation from above and wind stirring up waves and setting currents in motion. The pelagic zone refers to open and free waters in the body of the ocean that stretch between the ocean surface and the ocean bottom and are not too close to some boundary, like a shore or the seafloor or the surface.",
  "/wiki/Trophic_level": "The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food web.  A food chain is a succession of organisms that eat other organisms and may, in turn, be eaten themselves. The trophic level of an organism is the number of steps it is from the start of the chain. A food web starts at trophic level 1 with primary producers such as plants, can move to herbivores at level 2, carnivores at level 3 or higher, and typically finish with apex predators at level 4 or 5.  The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow or a food web.  Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths.\n The word trophic derives from the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae (troph\u0113) referring to food or nourishment.",
  "/wiki/Acantharchus_pomotis": "The mud sunfish (Acantharchus pomotis) is a sunfish (family Centrarchidae) widely distributed in the fresh waters along the Atlantic coast of North America, ranging from New York to Florida.\n The mud sunfish prefers sluggish, weedy waters of 10\u201322 \u00b0C (50\u201372 \u00b0F), over muddy, detritus-strewn bottoms, and occurs in small lakes as well as riverine backwaters. The maximum recorded size of this species is 21 cm (8.3 in).\n A. pomotis is currently the only species of genus Acantharchus but Baird had originally assigned it to Centrarchus. The generic name, Acantharchus, derives from the Greek \u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1 (thorn) and \u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (ruler).  A. pomotis is sometimes also known as the mud bass.",
  "/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)": "In biogeography, a species is indigenous to a given region or ecosystem if its presence in that region is the result of only natural processes, with no human intervention. The term is equivalent to the concept of native or autochthonous species. Every wild organism (as opposed to a domesticated organism) has its own natural range of distribution in which it is regarded as indigenous. Outside this native range, a species may be introduced by human activity, either intentionally or unintentionally; it is then referred to as an introduced species within the regions where it was anthropogenically introduced. The notion of indigeneity is often a blurred concept, as is a function of both time and political boundaries. Seen over long periods of time, plants and animals take part in the constant movement of tectonic plates\u2014species appear and may flourish, endure, or become extinct, and their distribution is rarely static or confined to a particular geographic location. An indigenous species in a location is not necessarily also endemic to that location. Endemic species are exclusively found in a particular place.",

  "/wiki/Amia_calva": "Bowfin (Amia calva) are bony fishes related to gars in the infraclass Holostei. Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, griddle, grinnel, swamp trout and choupique. They are regarded as taxonomic relicts, being the sole surviving species of the order Amiiformes which dates from the Jurassic to the Eocene, persisting to the present. Although bowfin are highly evolved, they are often referred to as primitive fishes because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors. Bowfin are demersal freshwater piscivores native to North America, and commonly found throughout much of the eastern United States, and in southern Ontario and Quebec. Fossil deposits indicate Amiiformes were once widespread in both freshwater and marine environments with a range that spanned across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Now their range is limited to much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada, including the drainage basins of the Mississippi River, Great Lakes and various rivers exiting in the Eastern Seaboard or Gulf of Mexico. Their preferred habitat includes vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps and backwater areas; they are also occasionally found in brackish water.",
  "/wiki/Anguilla_rostrata": "The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is a facultative catadromous fish found on the eastern coast of North America. Eels (Anguilla spp.) are fish belonging to the elopomorph superorder, a group of phylogenetically ancient teleosts. The American eel has a slender, snake-like body that is covered with a mucus layer, which makes the eel appear to be naked and slimy despite the presence of minute scales. A long dorsal fin runs from the middle of the back and is continuous with a similar ventral fin. Pelvic fins are absent, and relatively small pectoral fins can be found near the midline, followed by the head and gill covers. Variations exist in coloration, from olive green, brown shading to greenish-yellow and light gray or white on the belly. Eels from clear water are often lighter than those from dark, tannic acid streams.",
  "/wiki/Aphredoderus_sayanus": "The pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus) is a freshwater fish that commonly inhabits coastal waters along the east coast of the United States and the backwater areas of the Mississippi Valley. This species is often found towards the bottom of clear, warm water habitats with low currents. These fish are normally solitary, carnivorous, and nocturnal.  The pirate perch is known to consume live mosquito larva, amphipods, glass shrimp, meal worms, small fish, dragonfly and stonefly larvae, and earthworms.\n The pirate perch is related to the trout-perches, but only loosely; it is the only species in its family, Aphredoderidae. The specific name sayanus is a tribute to naturalist Thomas Say. Charles C. Abbott gave the fish its common name after observing it eating only other fishes.",
  "/wiki/Centrarchus_macropterus": "The flier (Centrarchus macropterus) is a sunfish (family Centrarchidae) native to muddy-bottomed swamps, ponds, weedy lakes, and riverine backwaters across the American South, from southern Illinois east to the Potomac River basin and south to Texas. C. macropterus is currently the only species of genus Centrarchus, but Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de had originally assigned it to Labrus (now confined to some marine wrasses). The generic name, Centrarchus, derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (center, in this sense sting) and \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2 (ruler), in reference, presumably, to the sharp spines on the anal fin. Centrarchus being the type genus of family Centrarchidae, it gives its name to the whole sunfish family. The specific name, macropterus, derives from \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (long fin). The flier, which can live up to five years, grows to a maximum recorded length of about 30 cm (1.0 ft). The maximum recorded weight of the species is just over one-half kilogram (about 19 oz). Fliers are occasionally kept in aquaria by North American native-fish fanciers.",
  "/wiki/Cyprinus_carpio_carpio": "Cyprinus carpio carpio is a subspecies of the common carp that is commonly found in Europe. They are native to much of Europe (notably the Danube and Volga Rivers) and can also be found in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Mitochondrial DNA analysis shows a difference between C. carpio carpio and Carpio carpio haematopterus. They are omnivorous in nature and feed on mollusks, insects, crustaceans and seeds. Though dark in color, there are some wild caught specimens which are colored orange (maybe domesticated ones that are only released into the rivers). This subspecies has also been domesticated in European ponds for hundreds of years. They are considered as an invasive species in the state of Washington and fishing them is encouraged to diminish their population.",
  "/wiki/Dorosoma_cepedianum": "The American gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), also known as the mud shad, is a member of the herring family of fish, and is native to large swaths of fresh and brackish waters of the United States of America. The adult has a deep body, with a silvery-green coloration above fading to plain silver below. The gizzard shad commonly resides in freshwater lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams, but can reside in brackish waters, as it does on the Atlantic coast of the United States. Their range is across most of the continental United States, although they typically go no further north than New York and no further west than New Mexico. They are large parts of many of the ecosystems they inhabit, and can drive changes in phyto- and zooplankton, thereby indirectly affecting other planktivorous fishes. The gizzard shad has been widely used as a food source for game fish, with varied success in management and effectiveness.",
  "/wiki/Elassoma_zonatum": "The banded pygmy sunfish, Elassoma zonatum, is a species of pygmy sunfish endemic to the United States, where it is found from Indiana and Illinois to Texas to the Atlantic coast.  It prefers densely vegetated bodies of slow-moving water.  This species can reach 4.7 cm (1.9 in) in total length, though most do not exceed 3.5 cm (1.4 in).\n The banded pygmy sunfish are capable of retaining their juvenile characteristics while they are sexually mature; that is to say that they are neotenous.\n It was originally thought that the banded pygmy sunfish belonged to the cichlid family. But, researchers Hay, Jordan, and Gilbert thought that the banded pygmy sunfish was actually an intermediate species of fish between the pirate perch and the centrarchid family of fishes. Therefore, the banded pygmy fish was placed into its own Family: Elassomatidae.",
  "/wiki/Enneacanthus_gloriosus": "The bluespotted sunfish (Enneacanthus gloriosus) is a species of fish in the family Centrarchidae, the sunfishes. It is native to the southeastern and eastern United States, its distribution extending as far north as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and far southern New York. It is native throughout most of its range, but some populations represent introductions, such as those in Lake Ontario and the upper Susquehanna River system.\n In many areas, this fish is sympatric with a closely related member of its genus, the banded sunfish (E. obesus). The two species are hard to tell apart. They are known to hybridize.",

  "/wiki/Erimyzon_oblongus": "The creek chubsucker (Erimyzon oblongus) is a freshwater fish of the sucker family (Catostomidae). The creek chubsucker is one of three species in the genus Erimyzon from the family Catostomidae present in eastern North America, and is found primarily in one of two disjunct populations; either in the eastern Coastal Plain streams or in the mid-western streams east of the Central Plains. The creek chubsucker is typically found in vegetated rocky riffle areas, runs, and pools of clear freshwater. The creek chubsucker is small in size typically measuring less than 10 inches and weighing slightly under pound. There is generally no sexual dimorphism exhibited between males and females and lifespan is typically from five to seven years. However, dimorphism does exist between juveniles and adults, with juveniles displaying a uniform, dark lateral stripe down the sides. Both sexes exhibit longitudinal scale rows, 4\u201318 dorsal fin rays, an air bladder with two chambers, dorsal fin base less than one-fourth standard length, and lateral line absent. During breeding, the males grow horn like tubercles, become more brightly colored, and are territorial of gravel substrates in shallow water areas.",
  "/wiki/Erimyzon_sucetta": "The lake chubsucker (Erimyzon sucetta) is a freshwater fish endemic to North America, being found in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basin, as far north as Ontario, Canada, extending south to the Gulf of Mexico. It is mostly found in lakes, ponds, and swamps, rarely in streams. It is a freshwater fish, and intermediate level consumer as it feeds on benthic detritus. More specifically it eats microcrustacea and midge larvae. Its average length is 25.8 cm. E. sucetta reportedly scatters its eggs randomly over aquatic vegetation and submerged grass in ponds  or over gravelly areas cleared by males. While the chubsucker is not in acute danger, 50% of its current range is secure, it is facing some difficulties because of siltation caused by agricultural practices. It can also be affected by coal ash spills, both directly by decreased swimming performance and indirectly by decreased energy resources available to it after release of coal ash into its environment.",
