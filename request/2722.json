  "/wiki/Baron_Kingsale": "Baron Kingsale is a title in the Peerage of Ireland, that of the premier baron in that peerage. The feudal barony dates to at least the thirteenth century. The first peerage creation was by writ. The numbering of the barons varies, some sources including the holders of the feudal barony, others commencing with the peers from 1340, and still others from 1397; a licence of that year issued to the fourth peer has often been mistaken for a patent creating the peerage, but this is not the case. This article follows the numbering of The Complete Peerage.\n The Baron also holds the feudal titles of Lord Courcy and Lord Ringrone, probably created in the twelfth century. Several sources claim that the Baron holds the privilege of being covered (that is, wearing a hat) in the presence of the monarch. The Eleventh Edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, however, disagrees, claiming that the story \"is a legend without historic foundation\". Despite the antiquity of the title, the family no longer retains its property or wealth, having supported the losing side in past conflicts; the 30th (or 35th) Baron, despite education at Stowe and the Universities of Paris and Salzburg due to his father's marriage to the daughter of a Yorkshire lanolin oil business, was, due to the failure of that business, amongst other things, an odd-job man and plumber, and died a resident of sheltered housing.",

The original grant of the lordship of Offelan was in 1175 to Maurice FitzGerald, one of Strongbow's main supporters.\n In 1538\u201350 the title was recreated for Brian O Conor Faly, who was based in neighbouring County Offaly.\n The first modern creation by Queen Mary I was for Gerald FitzGerald on 13 May 1554, who was also created Earl of Kildare at the same time and later restored to the senior earldom of Kildare (forfeit by his half-brother, Thomas) in 1569. The title (as well as the second creation of the earldom), became extinct in 1599 when the 13th earl's branch of the family became extinct and the senior earldom passed to his cousin, Gerald.\n The second creation of the title was for Lettice Digby on 29 July 1620. She was the daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, Lord Offally (1559\u20131580; the eldest son of the 11th earl, who predeceased his father) and the wife of Sir Robert Digby. Her eldest son, Robert, was created Baron Digby on the same day. The patent of the barony stipulated that it was not to pass to Lord Digby, but instead to the head of the House of Kildare, who, at the time of Baroness Offaly's death in 1658, was George FitzGerald, 16th Earl of Kildare. The 20th earl was later created Duke of Leinster in 1766 and the dukedom and barony remain united.",

From the mid eleventh century its dynasty adopted the surname Ua Conchobhair Failghe, or O Connor Faly (they were unrelated to the other notable Ua Conchobhair dynasties of Connacht and Kerry). Their seat was originally in Rathangan, County Kildare but moved to Daingean with the Norman arrival.\n In the 1530s Brian supported the revolt of Silken Thomas; on his defeat he was pardoned and was given the title \"Baron of Offaly\".\n On the death of the last de facto king, and de jure baron, Brian mac Cathaoir O Conchobhair Failghe, in about 1556, U\u00ed Failghe was split between the modern day counties of King's County (Offaly), Queen's County (Laois) and County Kildare by Mary I of England during the Plantations of Ireland.
