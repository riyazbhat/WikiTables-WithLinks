  "/wiki/Adam_Chandler": "Adam Chandler is a fictional character from the ABC and The Online Network daytime drama All My Children, portrayed by David Canary from Fall 1983 through his departure on April 23, 2010, and briefly reprising the role for the series' final weeks on ABC in September 2011. Canary also appeared several different times on One Life to Live. Adam Chandler was one of the most devious and powerful individuals within the town of Pine Valley, Pennsylvania. He is a member of the powerful and wealthy Chandler family, residing at the Chandler Mansion (300 River Road). Adam has been one of Pine Valley's most frequently married characters, but his most significant relationships have been with his sunny-natured autistic twin Stuart, and his long-time business rival Palmer Cortlandt; although the feud quieted down when Palmer's appearances within the show significantly decreased. Five of Adam's eight children have survived into adulthood; Skye Chandler Quartermaine, Hayley Vaughan Santos, JR Chandler, Miguel Reyes, and Colby Chandler. Through them, he has three grandchildren; Lila Rae Alcazar (Skye's daughter), Enzo Santos (Hayley's son), and AJ Chandler (JR's son). Alcoholism seems to run in the Chandler family, affecting Skye, Hayley and JR; Colby briefly followed the same path. His son JR was estranged from Adam because of his marriage to Annie Novak, and he started an affair with Annie to break up his father's marriage. This led to Adam Chandler leaving Pine Valley permanently (it is believed) in April 2010, to be with former wife Brooke English. After leaving town, Adam had his attorney and another ex-wife, Liza, serve Annie divorce papers. Recognized beyond fiction, Adam has been cited by scholars as one of the most powerful male figures in television, as well as one of its most complex villains, said to combine ruthlessness in business and love with wit and sometimes true tenderness.",

She is commonly known for terrorizing the residents of Pine Valley, including her sister Natalie Marlowe, and the murder of Will Cortlandt. Janet frequently suffers from bouts of psychosis resulting from emotional abuse inflicted upon her since childhood. While experiencing psychosis, she frequently hallucinates two-way conversations with her reflection in the mirror. The hallucination looks as the character did when first introduced; homely with dark hair and glasses. Its responses are consistently critical of Janet and while it does provide her with solutions to current obstacles, the solutions are often illegal and something a reasonable individual would not consider. As a result of her mental illness and erratic behavior, the character was sometimes referred to as Janet from Another Planet. Janet has had extended periods of sanity. She and her psyche have been studied within scholarly contexts. The role was originated in 1991 by Kate Collins, who had also portrayed Janet's sister, Natalie on the series since 1985.

Wheeler was once married to her Another World costar, Tom Eplin. They were married during the time that their characters Vicky/Marley and Jake were involved."
