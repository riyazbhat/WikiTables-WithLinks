  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca. It is named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, as England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula in the Baltic Sea. The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), and to a greater extent by Latin and French. English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.",

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain, and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9, meli, \"honey\". The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 (Melit\u0113) meaning \"honey-sweet\", possibly for Malta's unique production of honey; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island. The Romans called the island Melita, which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1. In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration \"Melite\" in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin. \"Melita\" is the spelling used in the Authorized (King James) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901. \"Malta\" is widely used in more recent versions, such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973. Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth, \"a haven\", or 'port' in reference to Malta's many bays and coves.",
  "/wiki/Maltese_language": "Maltese (Maltese: Malti) is a Semitic language spoken by the Maltese people of Malta. It is a standardised and Latinised variety of Arabic. It is the national language of the country and also serves as an official language of the European Union, the only Semitic language so distinguished. Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect during the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091. As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-christianisation of the island, Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of Latinisation. It is therefore exceptional as a variety of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic. Maltese morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian. The original Arabic base comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary, especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words, but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary.",
