  "/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling": "Ten-pin bowling is a type of bowling in which a bowler rolls a bowling ball down a wood or synthetic lane toward ten pins positioned in a tetractys (equilateral triangle-based pattern) at the far end of the lane. The objective is to knock down all ten pins on the first roll of the ball (a strike), or failing that, on the second roll (a spare).\n Behind a foul line is an approach approximately 15 feet (5 m) long used to impart speed and apply rotation to the ball. The 41.5-inch-wide (105 cm), 60-foot-long (18 m) lane is bordered along its length by gutters (channels) that collect errant balls. The lane's long and narrow shape limits straight-line ball paths to angles that are smaller than optimum angles for achieving strikes; accordingly, many advanced bowlers impart side rotation to hook (curve) the ball into the pins. \n Oil is applied in different patterns to approximately the first two-thirds of the lane's length to add complexity and regulate challenge in the sport. Especially when coupled with technological developments in ball design since the early 1990s, easier oil patterns, commonly called house shots or typical house patterns (THPs), enable many league bowlers to achieve scores rivaling those of professional bowlers who must bowl on more difficult patterns\u2014a development that has caused substantial controversy.\n People approach bowling as either a demanding precision sport or as a simple recreational pastime. Following substantial declines since the 1980s in both professional tournament television ratings and amateur league participation, bowling centers have increasingly expanded to become diverse entertainment centers.\n In most parts of the world, the game is commonly referred to simply as \"bowling\". In Canada and the New England region of the United States, the game is specifically called \"ten-pin bowling\" or \"big-ball bowling\" to distinguish it from sports with smaller balls such as candlepin bowling, duckpin bowling, and five-pin bowling. In the United Kingdom, it is formally referred to as \"ten-pin bowling\", as \"bowling\" can also refer to bowls.",
