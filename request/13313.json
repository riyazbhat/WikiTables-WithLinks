No opening or closing ceremonies were held; competitions began on 14 May and ended on 28 October.\n The Games were held as part of the 1900 World's Fair. In total, 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports. This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not \"Olympic\". Many athletes, among them some who won events, didn't know that they had competed in the Olympic Games. Women took part in the games for the first time, and sailor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Pourtal\u00e8s, born Helen Barbey in New York City, became the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes, who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest.\n At the Sorbonne conference of 1894, Pierre de Coubertin  proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris. The delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896. A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration.\n Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals, but were given cups or trophies. Professionals competed in fencing and Albert Robert Ayat (France), who won the \u00e9p\u00e9e for amateurs and masters, was awarded a prize of 3000 francs.\n Some events were contested for the only time in the history of the Games, including automobile and motorcycle racing, ballooning, cricket, croquet, Basque pelota, and 200m swimming obstacle race and underwater swimming. This was also the only Olympic Games in history to use live animals (pigeons) as targets during the shooting event.\n The host nation of France fielded 72% of all athletes (720 of the 997) and won the most gold, silver and bronze medal placings. U.S. athletes won the second-most in each, while fielding fewer than 8% of the participants (75 of 997).",

  "/wiki/Football_at_the_1920_Summer_Olympics": "Football was one of the 154 events at the 1920 Summer Olympics, held in Antwerp, Belgium. It was the fifth time association football was on the Olympic schedule. The tournament was expanded to 14 countries, including a non-European nation (Egypt) by the first time.\n At the first Olympics after World War I, countries involved in the conflict (Germany, Austria, Hungary, and their allies Bulgaria and Turkey) were not invited. The English FA had withdrawn from FIFA (together with the junior partners from Scotland, Ireland and Wales) after their demand that the federations of Germany, Austria and Hungary be excluded had been rejected. FIFA nevertheless accepted the entry of a Great Britain football team, judging that countries entering the Olympic Games in other sports should not be hindered entering the football tournament.\n However, the gold medalists of the previous two Olympic football tournaments would not enjoy their participation long, as they were defeated 1\u20133 in the first round by Norway, who thus celebrated one of their iconic victories (to be followed by the elimination of Nazi Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the 1993 win over England in World Cup qualifying, and the 2\u20131 defeat of reigning world champions Brazil at the 1998 World Cup).\n The final (and gold) was won by host Belgium against Czechoslovakia (which participated in an international competition for the first time in their history) after the Czechs walked off to protest the officiating, and were subsequently disqualified from the tournament.\n A play-off was necessary to determine the silver medallists. France refused to play because most of their players had returned home. So Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden played off for the right to meet the Netherlands for second place. Finally Spain won the silver medal, while the Netherlands won the bronze medal.",
  "/wiki/Netherlands_at_the_Olympics": "The Netherlands first sent athletes to the Olympic Games in 1900, and has participated in almost all Games since then with the exception of 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. In 1956, the nation boycotted the Games in Melbourne as a protest against the Soviet invasion in Hungary just a few weeks before the beginning of the Games.  (However, one Dutch rider competed in the 1956 equestrian events, held in Stockholm a few months before the rest of the Games.)\n The first individual gold medal at the Summer Games was earned by Maurice Peeters in cycling at the 1920 Summer Olympics, in the men's 1000 metres sprint event.\nThe first gold medal at the Winter Games was earned by Sjoukje Dijkstra in ladies' figure skating at the 1964 Winter Olympics.\n The Netherlands hosted the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The Netherlands had expressed interest in hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics in either Amsterdam or Rotterdam, as a centennial celebration of the 1928 Games. Eventually, no bid came from either city and the Olympics were awarded to Los Angeles.\n Prior to the 1992 Olympics, the country name was \"Holland\" with the country code of \"HOL\". From the 1992 onward, they have utilized the \"Netherlands\" and \"NED\", as an abbreviation of the original Dutch name Nederland.\n Dutch athletes have won 285 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, with swimming and cycling as the top medal-producing sports.  The nation has won another 130 medals at the Winter Olympic Games, of which 121 have come from speed skating.\n Following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 (which was a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee (NAOC) lost its Olympic license in July, 2011. After the 2012 Olympic Games in London, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles can choose to participate for the Netherlands or Aruba, which has a semi-independent status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. At the 2012 Games, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated in a unified Olympic team under the IOC flag. However, some athletes had already expressed their wish to represent either the Netherlands or Aruba in London."
