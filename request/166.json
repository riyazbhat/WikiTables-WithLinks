  "/wiki/Brechfa_Forest": "The Brechfa Forest is an area of forest in Carmarthenshire, south Wales.\nBrechfa Forest is the 'modern' name for part of the ancient Glyn Cothi Forest.   From before records began in the 6th century the communities in the 15 villages which encircle Glyn Cothi Forest were managing it to provide employment, building materials,  products, and grazing.  At various times the forest has been the refuge of Welsh Princes fighting the Norman Invasion,   a Royal Hunting Forest, and for two centuries was the 'Texas' of Wales,  producing large quantities of oil for lamps. and was a major supplier of timber for the trenches and explosives during World War One.\n The Forestry Commission was established to increase timber production during World War One taking control of woodland which was no longer productive.  Like the New Forest and the Forest of Dean,  Glyn Cothi Forest was still being actively managed by the local community at this point and was a major supplier of timber for the trenches, as well as oil and explosives. During the depression in the 1930s the UK government purchased land which had been part of the original Glyn Cothi forest but had been converted to agriculture. Much of the planting work to create conifer plantations and construction of forest roads was carried out by young unemployed men from a Ministry of Labour work camp. Many came from the distressed coal mining communities, and were recruited for training in one of a number of Instructional Centres created by the Ministry, most of which were on Forestry Commission property; by 1938, the Ministry had 38 Instructional Centres across Britain. The hutted camp in Brechfa was later used to house Basque children who were refugees from the Spanish Civil War.\n Management and maintenance of the forest continued to be a major source of employment for local residents until the 1980s when Forestry Commission policies changed to increased mechanisation and subcontracting of work.   Carmarthenshire County Council then started regeneration projects to develop Brechfa Forest and the adjoining Llanllwni Mountain as tourist attractions and for recreation.\n Brechfa Forest provides open access space for walkers,  horse riders and cyclists.   Tourism is the second largest source of employment in the villages surrounding the forest.   It has become one of Wales' prime destinations for mountain bikers, and is home to several trails designed specifically for mountain biking, and a mountain biking centre.\n The area is now one of the pilot areas for Wales on supporting the development of a strong sustainable local economy through supporting the communities to take the lead in the development of the area.\n From 1 April 2013 the Countryside Council for Wales, Environment Agency Wales, the Forestry Commission Wales and some aspects of the Welsh Government's activities was merged into a single Welsh Government sponsored body, Natural Resources Wales (Welsh: Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru.

The three largest towns are Llanelli, Carmarthen and Ammanford. Carmarthen is the county town and administrative centre.\n Carmarthenshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The county town was founded by the Romans, and the region was part of the Principality of Deheubarth in the High Middle Ages. After invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13th centuries it was subjugated, along with other parts of Wales, by Edward I of England. There was further unrest in the early 15th century, when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glynd\u0175r, and during the English Civil War.\n Carmarthenshire is mainly an agricultural county, apart from the southeastern part which was once heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In the north of the county, the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. The economy depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. West Wales was identified in 2014 as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys with the decline in its industrial base, and the low profitability of the livestock sector.\n Carmarthenshire, as a tourist destination, offers a wide range of outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. The sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine are further west. Carmarthenshire has a number of medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is at Laugharne.",

There is no charge for using the trails, but there is a charge for the car park at Coed y Brenin Visitor Centre. This costs \u00a31 for 1 hour, \u00a33 for 3 hours and \u00a35 for all day parking. All of the proceeds go towards the maintenance and improvement of the forest trails.\n The site was identified as a potential mountain bike race course in 1990, and the first races were held there in 1991. The initial course had to be chopped out of an impassable rock-strewn terrain.\n Shortly afterwards a Mountain Biking hire shop, together with a visitor centre and caf\u00e9 were opened at Maesgwm. Five waymarked trails were developed by Dafydd Davis who was employed by Forest Enterprise as a Forest Sports Development Adviser, grew Coed y Brenin into a major UK mountain biking centre. Davis received an MBE in the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours list for 'services to forestry' relating to his work on this resort.\n A new \u00a31.6 million visitor centre opened in the summer of 2006. Since the opening of the centre, the trail offering has grown to eight mountain biking trails, eight walking trails and five running trails. These trails are way marked.\n The visitor information desk is available seven days per week, throughout the year (except Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day) during the gift shop opening hours of 10:00hrs and 16:00hrs. There are a number of picnic tables around the main car parks within Coed y Brenin Forest Park plus many more on the waymarked walking trails. Some of the picnic tables have metal frames for holding disposable barbeques. There are also stone BBQ plinths in Glasdir and Ty'n y Groes picnic sites.",

  "/wiki/Colliery": "Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine \u2013 a pit, and the above-ground structures \u2013 a pit head. In Australia, \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the United States, \"colliery\" has been used[when?] to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n Coal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large open cut and long wall mines.
