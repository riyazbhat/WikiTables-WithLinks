  "/wiki/Botan_(programming_library)": "Botan is a BSD-licensed cryptographic library written in C++. It provides a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms, formats, and protocols, e.g. SSL and TLS. It is used in the Monotone distributed revision control program, the OpenDNSSEC system, and ISC's Kea DHCP server among other projects. The project was originally called OpenCL, a name now used by Apple Inc. and Khronos Group for a heterogeneous system programming framework. It was renamed Botan in 2002. In 2007, the German Federal Office for Information Security contracted FlexSecure GmbH to add an implementation of Card Verifiable Certificates for ePassports to Botan; the modified version of Botan was released under the name InSiTo. Starting in 2015, the German Federal Office for Information Security funded a project, which included improving the documentation, test suite and feature set of Botan, culminating in 2017, when it was evaluated and recommended as a library suitable for applications with increased security requirements.",
  "/wiki/Sqlite": "SQLite (/\u02cc\u025bs\u02cckju\u02d0\u02cc\u025bl\u02c8a\u026at/, /\u02c8si\u02d0kw\u0259\u02ccla\u026at/) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) contained in a C library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a client\u2013server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program. SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, generally following PostgreSQL syntax. However, SQLite uses a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity. This means that one can, for example, insert a string into a column defined as an integer. SQLite will attempt to convert data between formats where appropriate, the string 123 into an integer in this case, but does not guarantee such conversions, and will store the data as-is if such a conversion is not possible. SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers.",
  "/wiki/Zlib": "zlib is a software library used for data compression. zlib was written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler and is an abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in their gzip file compression program. zlib is also a crucial component of many software platforms, including Linux, macOS, and iOS. It has also been used in gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Wii U, Wii, Xbox One and Xbox 360. The first public version of zlib, 0.9, was released on 1 May 1995 and was originally intended for use with the libpng image library. It is free software, distributed under the zlib License.",
  "/wiki/Bzip2": "bzip2 is a free and open-source file compression program that uses the Burrows\u2013Wheeler algorithm. It only compresses single files and is not a file archiver. It is developed by Julian Seward and maintained by Federico Mena. Seward made the first public release of bzip2, version 0.15, in July 1996. The compressor's stability and popularity grew over the next several years, and Seward released version 1.0 in late 2000. [not verified in body] Following a nine year hiatus of updates for the project since 2010, on June 4, 2019 Federico Mena accepted maintainership of the bzip2 project.",
  "/wiki/XZ_Utils": "XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including LZMA and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. xz achieves higher compression rates than alternatives like gzip and bzip2. Decompression speed is faster than bzip2, but slower than gzip. Compression can be much slower than gzip, and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression, and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times. XZ Utils consists of two major components:",
  "/wiki/Boost_(C++_libraries)": "Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing. It contains 160 individual libraries (as of version 1.72). Most of the Boost libraries are licensed under the Boost Software License, designed to allow Boost to be used with both free and proprietary software projects. Many of Boost's founders are on the C++ standards committee, and several Boost libraries have been accepted for incorporation into the C++ Technical Report 1, the C++11 standard (e.g. smart pointers, thread, regex, random, ratio, tuple) and the C++17 standard (e.g. filesystem, any, optional, variant, string_view).",
