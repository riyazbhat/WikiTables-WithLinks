  "/wiki/Bewitch_(horse)": "Bewitch (1945\u20131959) was a Thoroughbred race horse born in 1945 at Calumet Farm, Kentucky, United States in the same crop in which the stallion Bull Lea produced Citation and Coaltown.  Each of them was eventually inaugurated into the Thoroughbred Hall of Fame.  Bewitch was the only filly of the three.\n From her dam, Potheen (purchased by Warren Wright for the small sum of $500), Bewitch inherited the blood of Broomstick, whose sire was the great Ben Brush.  On her mother's side also flowed the blood of Peter Pan (sired by Commando) and Hanover (sired by Hindoo).\n Trained by the Hall of Famer Ben A. Jones, as a two-year-old Bewitch won her first eight starts, six of them consecutive stakes races.  In her first effort, she led throughout and won by six lengths.  One of these stakes was the Washington Park Futurity, in which she beat Citation, the only defeat he suffered as a two-year-old.\n Before the end of her first season, Ben Jones turned her training over to his son, Jimmy Jones, who also  became a member of the Hall of Fame. Bewitch was named the Champion Two-Year-Old Filly for 1947.  At the end of her third season, even though she was out of action with bucked shins until late June, she won four of her six starts.\n When she was four, in winning the Beverly Handicap at the old Washington Park Race Track in Chicago, Illinois, she ran the fastest mile ever run by a filly.\n At the age of five, she raced from one end of the country to the other, unplaced only once. When she was six, she ran fifteen times, twelve of those races against males.\n When she retired, Bewitch had earned $462,605, which made her the greatest money-earning filly to date. In 1977, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with both her trainers, father and son, as well as her running mates, Citation and Coaltown.",
