It was first published three times a month, using the Japanese Jun (\u65ec) system of dividing months into three parts, but the postwar Kinema Junp\u014d has been published twice a month.\n The magazine was founded by a group of four students, including Sabur\u014d Tanaka, at the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Technical High School at the time). In that first month, it was published three times on days with a \"1\" in them. These first three issues were printed on art paper and had four pages each. Kinejun initially specialized in covering foreign films, in part because its writers sided with the principles of the Pure Film Movement and strongly criticized Japanese cinema. It later expanded coverage to films released in Japan. While long emphasizing film criticism, it has also served as a trade journal, reporting on the film industry in Japan and announcing new films and trends.\n After their building was destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in September 1923, the Kinejun offices were moved to the city of Ashiya in the Hanshin area of Japan, though the main offices are now back in Tokyo.\n The Kinema Junpo awards began in 1926, and their 10 best list is considered iconic and prestigious.",
