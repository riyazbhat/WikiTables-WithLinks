Unlike the AFL\u2019s more recent expansion clubs, the Gold Coast Suns and Greater Western Sydney Giants (GWS), Brisbane received absolutely no assistance from the VFL/AFL when it was first established and was given only 5 months to recruit an entire team. Despite this however, the club went on to secure 6 wins in its first season and remains the only expansion club from the northern states to avoid finishing in last place on the ladder at the end of their first season. In contrast, the Gold Coast Suns only won 3 games in their first season and GWS only won 4. Both the Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants, unlike Brisbane, also finished on the bottom of the ladder at the end of their first season. Brisbane made the finals for the first time in 1995 and only narrowly missed out on a position in the grand final the following year when they were defeated by North Melbourne in the preliminary finals.

Although Fitzroy won a total of eight VFL premierships they never won a premiership as the Lions. They won seven premierships (1898, 1899, 1904, 1905, 1913, 1916 and 1922) as the Maroons and one (1944) as the Gorillas. The decision of the club to change its name to the \u2018Lions\u2019 in 1957 coincided with what history now records as the beginning of decades of poor on-field performance and financial mismanagement that eventually resulted in the club being placed into administration and forced out of the AFL in 1996. Although the club managed to survive and came out of administration in 1998 it never played in the AFL again. Fitzroy largely resumed its original VFL-AFL identity through its continued use of their 1975\u20131996 VFL-AFL jumper, their theme song and their 1884\u20131966 home ground at the Brunswick Street Oval.",
