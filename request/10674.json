It was the first Byzantine church in California. It is located on Sepulveda Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California. It is the only Byzantine Ruthenian Church in the territory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. In 1956, the bishop of the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh granted permission for a priest to minister in Los Angeles. In 1957, the parish purchased land on Sepulveda Boulevard, and the new church was dedicated in 1961. In 1976, the third pastor, Father Eugene Linowski, re-ordered the liturgical services to conform with the authentic traditions of the Byzantine Church (according to the Recension as prescribed by Rome). An icon screen was installed two years later. The screen maintains a traditional aura of mystery that separates the sanctuary from the rest of the church. At St. Mary's the screen is a wrought iron grill with icons painted by local artist Mila Mina. Fr. Eugene Linowski became the first Rector of the Cathedral, from March to June 1982.",
