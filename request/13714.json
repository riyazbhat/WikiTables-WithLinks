Born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser-Pryce ascended to prominence in 2008 when at 21 years old, the relatively unknown athlete became the first Caribbean woman to win 100 m gold at the Olympics. In 2012, she became the third woman in history to successfully defend an Olympic 100 m title. Fraser-Pryce took a break from athletics in 2017 to have her first child. At the 2019 World Championships, at the age of 32, she became the oldest woman and second mother ever to win 100 m gold at a global championship. Fraser-Pryce is the only sprinter to be crowned world champion over 100 m four times (2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019). Since 2008, she has won four of the five World Championship 100 m titles she has contested, as well as two of the last three Olympic 100 m titles. She is the second female sprinter to hold world and Olympic 100 m titles simultaneously - and the first woman to hold dual titles on two separate occasions. In 2013 she became the first female sprinter to win gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m and 4 \u00d7 100 m in a single World Championship, and also became the first woman to hold world titles at 60 m, 100 m, 200 m and 4 \u00d7 100 m relay simultaneously. With over a decade of dominance in the sport, Fraser-Pryce has won more global 100 m titles than any other female sprinter in history. Nicknamed the Pocket Rocket for her petite frame (she stands 5 feet tall) and explosive block starts, her personal best of 10.70 seconds is the joint fourth fastest of all time. Due to her achievements and consistency, many publications and sports analysts, including former Olympian Michael Johnson, refer to Fraser-Pryce as the greatest female sprinter of all time.",

He is a world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay. Owing to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time. An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). In addition he won two 4 \u00d7 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory. An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100 m, 200 m and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011. He is the most successful athlete of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200 m and is the joint-most successful in the 100 m with three titles. Bolt improved upon his second 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 - the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world record, setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay world records, with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012.",

The competition comprised four rounds: a preliminary round for entrants without the minimum qualifying standard, a heats round, followed by three semi-finals of eight athletes each, which then reduced to eight athletes for the final. Leading up to this Olympics, defending champion Usain Bolt was the star of the sport having set world records in winning the 100 metres and 200 metres in the previous Olympics, and 2 more world records in winning the 100m and 200m at the 2009 world championships. In the 2011 world championships, the 100 metres was won by Yohan Blake after a false start by Bolt. Later in the season, Blake ran a new 200 metres personal best only .07 behind Bolt's world record. At the 2012 Jamaican Olympic Trials, Blake beat Bolt in both events. In the final, Bolt, started slow out of the blocks and was behind Blake and Gatlin, but accelerated with 50 meters to go, to win the gold medal and was around five feet (1.5 meters) ahead of the competition at the finish line. Bolt set a new Olympic record (beating his own record set at the 2008 Olympic Games) of 9.64 seconds, later rounded down to 9.63 seconds. Blake edged past Gatlin, who in turn held off a closing Gay at the finish line. Usain Bolt was the second athlete after Carl Lewis (1984, 1988) to retain the men's 100m championship. His winning time was the second fastest time ever behind his own world record. Yohan Blake finished second in 9.75 seconds.",

The semi-final round showed all three Jamaican athletes were the class of the field. In heat one, Yohan Blake had a huge lead and relaxed down the straightaway, almost too much as Wallace Spearmon and Christophe Lemaitre raced to the line behind him in the fastest heat of the day. Usain Bolt dominated the second heat, jogging and looking around for non-existent challengers down the straight. And in heat three, Warren Weir was running easily, easing up at the finish to let Churandy Martina take the first spot, knowing he had qualified in the second position. Slowest qualifier Alex Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez, racing hard for his 20.37, was on the opposite side of a clear dividing line in the field. In the final, Bolt, who was in lane 7, moved past his Jamaican teammate Weir after only 50 metres; coming off the bend and onto the final 100-metre straight, Bolt's lead over the rest of the field had grown to several metres, however Blake began to pull him back. Due to the lead he had built in the first 120 meters, it was Bolt who crossed the line first in a time of 19.32, already easing off before the line. In doing so, he became the first man in history to do the double double - winning both the 100 and 200 metres twice, back to back (he would later break this record by winning the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay and completing the Double Triple, at the same Olympics). Blake took the silver medal, as he had done in the 100 metres final, again behind Bolt. His time was the fastest ever time to not win a gold medal. Weir completed the 1-2-3 sweep for the Jamaicans by winning the bronze medal, the second time in any international competition that Jamaica has achieved this (after the women did it in the 2008 100 metres).",

In this particular race, his reaction time was incredibly slow (almost 0.25 s) and had he made even an average start he would have comfortably set a new world record, bettering the seemingly unreachable Usain Bolt's improbable record.
