The linemen of the team currently in possession of the ball are the offensive line, while linemen on the opposing team are the defensive line.

The defensive line is covered by the same rules that apply to all defensive players. Linemen are usually the largest players on the field in both height and weight, since their positions usually require less running and more strength than skill positions."
