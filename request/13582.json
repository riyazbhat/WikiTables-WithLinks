  "/wiki/John_Gielgud": "Sir Arthur John Gielgud, OM, CH (/\u02c8\u0261i\u02d0l\u0261\u028ad/;   14 April 1904 \u2013 21 May 2000) was an English actor and theatre director whose career spanned eight decades. With Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he was one of the trinity of actors who dominated the British stage for much of the 20th century. A member of the Terry family theatrical dynasty, he gained his first paid acting work as a junior member of his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry's company in 1922. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art he worked in repertory theatre and in the West End before establishing himself at the Old Vic as an exponent of Shakespeare in 1929\u201331.\n During the 1930s Gielgud was a stage star in the West End and on Broadway, appearing in new works and classics. He began a parallel career as a director, and set up his own company at the Queen's Theatre, London. He was regarded by many as the finest Hamlet of his era, and was also known for high comedy roles such as John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earnest. In the 1950s Gielgud feared that his career was threatened when he was convicted and fined for a homosexual offence, but his colleagues and the public supported him loyally. When avant-garde plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles, and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one-man Shakespeare show Ages of Man. From the late 1960s he found new plays that suited him, by authors including Alan Bennett, David Storey and Harold Pinter.\n During the first half of his career, Gielgud did not take the cinema seriously. Though he made his first film in 1924, and had successes with The Good Companions (1933) and Julius Caesar (1953), he did not begin a regular film career until his sixties. Gielgud appeared in more than sixty films between Becket (1964), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination for playing Louis VII of France, and Elizabeth (1998). As the acid-tongued Hobson in Arthur (1981) he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His film work further earned him a Golden Globe Award and two BAFTAs.\n Although largely indifferent to awards, Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He was famous from the start of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",

  "/wiki/Peter_Hammond_(actor)": "Peter Charles Hammond Hill (15 November 1923 \u2013 12 October 2011) was an English actor and television director.\n Peter Charles Hammond Hill was born in Victoria, Central London. His father, Charles, was an art restorer and his mother, Ada, a nurse. After attending Harrow School of Art, he started work as a scenic artist at Sheffield Repertory Theatre. Following this, he turned to acting to \"earn some cash\", where he changed his name to Peter Hammond. He appeared in West End productions at the age of 17.\n He made his film d\u00e9but in Waterloo Road in 1945, and went on to carve a career playing handsome boy next door types throughout the late forties and early fifties, most notably as Peter Hawtrey in The Huggetts Trilogy \u2013 Here Come the Huggetts (1948), Vote for Huggett and The Huggetts Abroad (both 1949).\n His other films include Holiday Camp (1947), Helter Skelter (1949), Morning Departure (1950), The Adventurers (1951) and X the Unknown (1956).\n In 1950, Hammond was reunited with his Huggetts co-star Petula Clark and played her love interest in Ealing's Dance Hall. He gave Clark her first screen kiss in this film.\n His prominent television roles include Hofmanstahl in The Adventures of William Tell and Lt. Edward Beamish in The Buccaneers.\n In the 1960s he turned to directing television programmes, including The Avengers, Armchair Theatre and Out of the Unknown.\n His work on The Avengers gave Hammond a free hand to explore many stylistic opportunities. Producer Leonard White and series creator Sydney Newman both congratulated him on giving the early videotape episodes their distinctive visual style. Patrick Macnee credited him as a major influence in the shaping of the character of Steed. It was through Hammond's work on The Avengers and Armchair Theatre (also for Leonard White) that he would be awarded a Director's Bafta in 1965. Hammond's work on the series was entirely on the videotape seasons (1961\u201364). Although Brian Clemens, producer of the filmed episodes of the show (1965\u201369), approached him a few times about directing further episodes, Hammond wasn't interested: \"I told them to get lost \u2013 there was nothing I could love about the Avengers being made on film\".\n His one foray into film saw him directing James Mason in Spring and Port Wine in 1970, based on the play of the same name by Bill Naughton. Set in the Lancashire town of Bolton, the film is still fondly regarded by those from the area.\n He continued to direct many popular TV series of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, including King of the Castle, a 1978 production of Wuthering Heights for the BBC, The Dark Angel for BBC2, Rumpole of the Bailey, Follyfoot, The Wednesday Play, BBC's Cold Comfort Farm in 1968, Tales of the Unexpected, 1966 BBC mini-series The Three Musketeers, The Little World of Don Camillo, The Return of Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Morse and many more.\n Peter Neill, a colleague who worked with Hammond on various productions of the time, remembers him as \"very efficient, yet creative, with a friendly manner and sense of humour\". He is said also to have had a good rapport with actors, perhaps due to his own background in that area.\n He retired from directing in the mid-1990s due to illness and to look after his wife, Maureen Glynne, whom he married in 1948, until her death in 2005. They had three sons and two daughters.",

However, while Play For Today's style had been a largely studio-based form of theatre on television, the new series was shot entirely on film. This was an attempt by the BBC to repeat the success of Channel 4's television films, many of which had been released in cinemas.\n From 1989 to 1998 a companion series, Screen One, was broadcast on the more mainstream BBC1. After appearing more sporadically in the mid-1990s, Screen Two came to an end as the BBC moved its attentions away from expensive single dramas and concentrated production on series and serials instead. The last programme shown under the Screen Two name was Stephen Poliakoff's The Tribe in June 1998."
