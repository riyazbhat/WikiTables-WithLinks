  "/wiki/Jacquard_Loom": "The Jacquard machine (French:\u00a0[\u0292aka\u0281]) is a device fitted to a power loom that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns as brocade, damask and matelass\u00e9. It was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804, based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). The machine was controlled by a \"chain of cards\"; a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Several such paper cards, generally white in color, can be seen in the images below. Chains, like Bouchon's earlier use of paper tape, allowed sequences of any length to be constructed, not limited by the size of a card.\n Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving inventions as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving. The term \"Jacquard\" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles, such as jerseys.\n This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware.",
  "/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard": "Joseph Marie Charles dit (called or nicknamed) Jacquard (French:\u00a0[\u0292aka\u0281]; 7 July 1752 \u2013 7 August 1834) was a French weaver and merchant. He played an important role in the development of the earliest programmable loom (the \"Jacquard loom\"), which in turn played an important role in the development of other programmable machines, such as an early version of digital compiler used by IBM to develop the modern day computer.",
  "/wiki/Plankalk\u00fcl": "Plankalk\u00fcl (German pronunciation: [\u02c8pla\u02d0nkalky\u02d0l]) is a programming language designed for engineering purposes by Konrad Zuse  between 1942 and 1945. It was the first high-level programming language to be designed for a computer.\n Kalk\u00fcl is the German term for a formal system\u2014as in Hilbert-Kalk\u00fcl, the original name for the Hilbert-style deduction system\u2014so Plankalk\u00fcl refers to a formal system for planning.",
  "/wiki/Konrad_Zuse": "Konrad Zuse (German: [\u02c8k\u0254n\u0281at \u02c8tsu\u02d0z\u0259]; 22 June 1910 \u2013 18 December 1995) was a German civil engineer, pioneering computer scientist, inventor and businessman. His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.\n Zuse was also noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941, producing the Z4, which became the world's first commercial computer. From 1943 to 1945 he designed the first high-level programming language, Plankalk\u00fcl. In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book Rechnender Raum (Calculating Space).\n Much of his early work was financed by his family and commerce, but after 1939 he was given resources by the Nazi German government. Due to World War II, Zuse's work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and the United States. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM's option on his patents in 1946.\n There is a replica of the Z3, as well as the original Z4, in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse, displaying twelve of his machines, including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse's paintings.",
  "/wiki/ENIAC": "ENIAC (/\u02c8\u025bni\u00e6k/; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic general-purpose digital computer. It was Turing-complete, and able to solve \"a large class of numerical problems\" through reprogramming.\n Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory), its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.\n ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10, 1945.\n ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946 and was heralded as a \"Giant Brain\" by the press. It had a speed on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines; this computational power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists alike. The combination of speed and programmability allowed for thousands more calculations for problems, as ENIAC calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours (allowing one ENIAC hour to displace 2,400 human hours). The completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14, 1946 and formally dedicated the next day at the University of Pennsylvania, having cost almost $500,000 (approximately $6,300,000 today). It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. ENIAC was shut down on November 9, 1946 for a refurbishment and a memory upgrade, and was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in 1947. There, on July 29, 1947, it was turned on and was in continuous operation until 11:45\u00a0p.m. on October 2, 1955.",
  "/wiki/John_von_Neumann": "John von Neumann (/v\u0252n \u02c8n\u0254\u026am\u0259n/; Hungarian: Neumann J\u00e1nos Lajos, pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8n\u0252jm\u0252n \u02c8ja\u02d0no\u0283 \u02c8l\u0252jo\u0283]; December 28, 1903\u00a0\u2013 February\u00a08, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and polymath. Von Neumann was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his time and said to be \"the last representative of the great mathematicians\"; who integrated both pure and applied sciences.\n He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.\n He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.\n He published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied mathematics, 20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones. His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while he was in hospital, was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain.\n His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he stated, \"The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in G\u00f6ttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927\u20131929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935\u20131939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931\u20131932.\"\n During World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam and others, problem solving key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb. He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon, and coined the term \"kiloton\" (of TNT), as a measure of the explosive force generated.\n After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and consulted for a number of organizations, including the United States Air Force, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. As a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, concerned that the Soviets would achieve nuclear superiority, he designed and promoted the policy of mutually assured destruction to limit the arms race.",

  "/wiki/Alan_Turing": "Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/\u02c8tj\u028a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/; 23 June 1912\u00a0\u2013 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.\n During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.\n Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14\u00a0million lives.\n After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.\n Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that \"gross indecency\" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.\n In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.\n In July 2019, the Bank of England announced that Turing would be depicted on the United Kingdom's new \u00a350 note.",
