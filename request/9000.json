These data are recorded differently to Cambodian census data and significant variations are to be expected between the two due to internal and external migration. The national census does not record population by city, rather by province. The only available method of estimating the population of a city is through the CDB, which is updated every two years. For instance, the 2018 CDB suggests that 1,474,489 people were living in Phnom Penh municipality, whereas the 2019 census (which only preliminary results have been released for) suggests 2,129,371. The figures listed in the table below are based on the most recently published Commune Database. However, it should be expected that the population in Phnom Penh and other major urban centres, such as Siem Reap, Battambang, and Preah Sihanouk will be underestimated; while the population in smaller provincial municipalities, particularly those on the border with Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, will be overestimated.

The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer Aphaiwong family, a branch of the Khmer royal family, which governed for six generations until 1907 when the province was ceded to the French to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the French Indochina colony. Following colonization by the French, an urban layout was developed which resulted in an enlarged French colonial town. This first attempt at modernization resulted in well-defined streets laid in a grid pattern, building of urban structures and three main streets parallel to the Sangkae River, and the linking of both banks by the construction of two bridges in 1917. Military and prison facilities were also erected. Nineteen years later, a second urban development plan was implemented with a newly constructed railway linking Battambang to Phnom Penh.",
