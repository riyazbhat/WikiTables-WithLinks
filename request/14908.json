  "/wiki/Wheel_arrangement": "In rail transport, a wheel arrangement or wheel configuration is a system of classifying the way in which wheels are distributed under a locomotive. Several notations exist to describe the wheel assemblies of a locomotive by type, position, and connections, with the adopted notations varying by country.  Within a given country, different notations may also be employed for different kinds of locomotives, such as steam, electric, and diesel powered.\n Especially in steam days, wheel arrangement was an important attribute of a locomotive because there were many different types of layout adopted, each wheel being optimised for a different use (often with only some being actually driven). Modern diesel and electric locomotives are much more uniform, usually with all axles driven.",
  "/wiki/GWR_1500_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 1500 Class is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive.  Despite being a GWR Hawksworth design, all ten (nos 1500\u20131509) were completed under the administration of the Western Region of British Railways in 1949, just after Nationalisation.",
  "/wiki/0-6-0PT": "The GWR 0-6-0PT (Pannier Tank), is a type of steam locomotive built by the British Great Western Railway with the water tanks carried on both sides of the boiler, in the manner of panniers. They were used for local, suburban and branch line passenger and goods traffic, for shunting duties, and as banker engines on inclines.  The early examples, such as the 1901 and 2021 classes, were rebuilt from saddle or side tanks when the locos received a Belpaire firebox \u2013 this type of firebox has a square top and is incompatible with a curved saddle tank. This process mostly took place during the tenure at Swindon Works of George Jackson Churchward. Only a very small number of saddle tank locomotives escaped rebuilding as panniers, notably the 1361 Class built new under Churchward in 1910, by which date a few of the 1813 Class had already been rebuilt as pannier tanks.",
  "/wiki/GWR_1600_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 1600 class is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive.",
  "/wiki/GWR_9400_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 9400 Class is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive, used for shunting and banking duties.\n The first ten 9400s were the last steam engines built by the GWR. After nationalisation in 1948, another 200 were built by private contractors for British Railways (BR). Most had very short working lives as the duties for which they were designed disappeared through changes in working practices or were taken over by diesel locomotives. Two locomotives survived into preservation, one as part of the National Collection.",
  "/wiki/GWR_2251_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 2251 Class was a class of 0-6-0 steam tender locomotive designed for medium-powered freight. They were introduced in 1930 as a replacement for the earlier Dean Goods 0-6-0s and built up to 1948.",
  "/wiki/0-6-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 0-6-0 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels. This was the most common wheel arrangement used on both tender and tank locomotives in versions with both inside and outside cylinders.\n In the United Kingdom, the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels. Under the UIC classification, popular in Europe, this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears, or Co if they are independently driven, the latter usually being electric and diesel-electric locomotives.",
  "/wiki/GWR_5101_Class": "The GWR 5101 Class or 'Large Prairie' was a class of 2-6-2T steam locomotives of the Great Western Railway.",
  "/wiki/2-6-2T": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 2-6-2 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels, six coupled driving wheels and two trailing wheels. This arrangement is commonly called a Prairie.",
  "/wiki/GWR_5700_Class": "The GWR 5700 Class, or 57xx class, was a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive, built by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and British Railways (BR) between 1929 and 1950. With 863 built, they were the most prolific class of the GWR, and one of the most numerous classes of British steam locomotive.[a]\n Although officially designated by GWR as light goods and shunting engines, they were also used for passenger working on branch, suburban, and shorter mainline journeys.\n They were distributed across most of the GWR network and, after nationalisation of the railways in 1948, across the British Railways Western Region, and also other regions.\n The 5700s were not as glamorous as the GWR Castles and Kings, but became just as much of an icon of the GWR.\n As a result of the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the 5700 Class was withdrawn from BR service between 1956 and 1966. Nineteen withdrawn locomotives were sold to London Transport and industry, of which ten were later preserved, along with six that were retrieved from scrapyards.",
  "/wiki/GWR_6959_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 6959 Class or Modified Hall Class is a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotive.  They were a development by Frederick Hawksworth of Charles Collett's earlier Hall Class named after English and Welsh country houses.",
  "/wiki/4-6-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by  wheel arrangement, 4-6-0 represents the configuration of four leading wheels on two axles in a leading bogie, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels. In the mid 19th century, this wheel arrangement became the second most popular configuration for new steam locomotives in the United States of America, where this type is commonly referred to as a Ten-wheeler. As a locomotive pulling trains of lightweight all wood passenger cars in the 1890-1920s, it was exceptionally stable at near 100 mph speeds on the New York Central's New York to Chicago Water Level Route and on the Reading Railroad's Camden to Atlantic City, NJ, line. As passenger equipment grew heavier with all steel construction, heavier locomotives replaced the Ten Wheeler.",
  "/wiki/GWR_4073_Class": "The 4073 Class or Castle class were 4-6-0 steam locomotives of the Great Western Railway, built between 1923 and 1950.  They were designed by the railway's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Charles Collett, for working the company's express passenger trains.",
  "/wiki/GWR_7400_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 6400 Class is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive introduced by Charles Collett in 1932. All 40 examples were 'auto-fitted' \u2013 equipped with the remote-control equipment needed for working autotrains. The 1936 GWR 7400 Class was a similar class, without the autotrain apparatus, but with a higher boiler pressure of 180 psi, providing a small but useful increase in power. An initial build of 30 in 1936-1937 was added to by British Railways in two batches each of ten locos in 1948 and 1950. These were destined for a short life, the briefest being only nine years. A minor visual difference between the 54xx and earlier 64xx, and the later series of 64xx, with the 74xx classes was at the join between cab and bunker. The 54xx and early 64xx had an arc whereas the later 64xx and the 74xx class was straight. The early locos also had a lip at the leading edge of the cab roof, whereas the later locos had a plain corner edge.",
  "/wiki/GWR_7800_Class": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 7800 Class or Manor Class is a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotive. They were designed as a lighter version of the GWR Grange Class, giving them a wider Route Availability. Like the 'Granges', the 'Manors' used parts from the GWR 4300 Class Moguls but just on the first batch of twenty. Twenty were built between 1938 and 1939, with British Railways adding a further 10 in 1950. They were named after Manors in the area covered by the Great Western Railway. Nine are preserved.",
  "/wiki/Steam_locomotives_of_British_Railways": "The steam locomotives of British Railways were used by British Railways over the period 1948\u20131968. The vast majority of these were inherited from its four constituent companies, the Big Four.\n In addition, BR built 2,537 steam locomotives in the period 1948\u20131960, 1,538 to pre-nationalisation designs and 999 to its own standard designs. These locomotives had short working lives, some as little as five years, because of the decision to end the use of steam traction by 1968, against a design life of over 30 years and a theoretical final withdrawal date of between 1990 and 2000."
