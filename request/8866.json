  "/wiki/Field_Goal_(video_game)": "Field Goal (\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb F\u012brudo G\u014dru) is an arcade game released in 1979 by Taito. It is a clone of the game Breakout, where the player must use the rotary knob to control a paddle and hit the ball into the red, yellow and blue helmets on the screen. Each time a row of helmets is cleared out, a new row will appear in its place. If the player hits the orange area towards the top of the screen, it will decrease the size of the player's paddle. Sometimes a football player will appear, and if the ball hits him, the player will earn bonus points.",
  "/wiki/Breakout_clone": "A Breakout clone (also known as a Breakout-style game, block-breaking game, brick buster, or brick smash, brick break, brick destroyer/destruction, or ball-and-paddle game) is a sub-class of the bat-and-ball genre. The genre is named for the dynamics of the player-controlled block, called a bat or a paddle, upon which the game is based, which hits a ball towards another player's bat or different objects such as colored tiles (called a brick). The term brick buster, coined in the early 2000s, mostly refers to more modern games. [citation needed]\nBreakout-style games are characterized by the addition of a wall of blocks or similar objects that the player chips away at with the ball as part of the main gameplay. Since the release of the original Breakout arcade game in 1976, and Super Breakout two years later, there have been many clones and updates for various platforms. The profusion and notability of such games has been enough for them to also be referred to by some as a genre in their own right. Among the cloners was Breakout designer Steve Wozniak, who wrote Little Brick Out, a software version for the Apple II of his own hardware game. In 1986 Arkanoid revitalized the concept by adding power-ups and a feel of depth to the visuals. Many Breakout clones since then have been styled after Arkanoid. In 1991, Atari Games released a remake of Breakout called Off the Wall. It modeled spin on the ball. While the original Breakout has the paddles laid out horizontally, a number of clones have changed this concept: Krakout on the Commodore 64 has the paddles vertically, with most of the gameplay happening in a horizontal layout, while TRAZ offers levels (complete with a level editor) that can have both paddles that move horizontally and paddles that move vertically.",
  "/wiki/Phoenix_(video_game)": "Phoenix is an outer space-themed, fixed shooter video game released in arcades in 1980. According to Centuri's Joel Hochberg, the game was licensed from a smaller Japanese developer. Amstar Electronics (which was located in Phoenix, Arizona) licensed the game to Centuri for manufacture in the United States. Taito released the game in Japan. Atari, Inc. released a port of Phoenix for the Atari 2600 in 1982. The Phoenix mothership is one of the first video arcade game bosses to be presented as a separate challenge. This was before the term boss was coined.",
  "/wiki/Shoot-em-up": "Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. The genre's roots can be traced back to Spacewar!, one of the earliest computer games, developed in 1962. The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders, which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978, and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979. Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s, and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts, particularly in Japan. Bullet hell games are a subgenre that features overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles, often in visually impressive formations.",
  "/wiki/Polaris_(video_game)": "Polaris is a 1980 fixed shooter arcade game by Taito. Players control a submarine which can only shoot missiles upward.

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters, in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed. The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires. The matches typically consist of several rounds, in an arena, with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into combos. Starting in the early 1990s, most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976, but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984. The following year, Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles, while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems. In 1987, Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks. In 1991, Capcom's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre. The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s, particularly in arcades. This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games, including franchises like Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros., Tekken, and Virtua Fighter.",

It is the second of four arcade games in the Bubble Bobble series (followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories, but itself has two direct sequels: Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2). The game was ported for numerous home computers and game consoles. The main characters are Bubblun and Bobblun, the protagonists of Bubble Bobble (known as Bub and Bob in the western releases). However, in this game they appear in their human forms as Bubby and Bobby, as opposed to the bubble dragons of the first game (following on from the first game's true ending). Also unlike the first game, players must now alternate (i.e., take turns), with player one as Bubby (green shirt), and player 2 as Bobby (blue shirt) (the same color scheme as in the first game).",
  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games, or platformers, are a video game genre and subgenre of action game. In a platformer, the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles. Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed. The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks, as in Ristar or Bionic Commando, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in Alpha Waves. These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called platforming, a verbification of platform. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series, fall outside of the genre. Platform games originated in the early 1980s, which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping, with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s. The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established, no later than 1983. The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres, such as the shooter elements in Contra, Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe, adventure elements of Flashback, or role-playing game elements of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. While commonly associated with console gaming, there have been many important platform games released to video arcades, as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers.",
