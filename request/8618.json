Within the United States, the government  federally recognizes the Comanche people as the Comanche Nation, headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma.\n The Comanche became the dominant  tribe on the southern Great Plains in the 18th and 19th centuries.  They are often characterized[by whom?] as \"Lords of the Plains\" and, reflecting their erstwhile prominence, they presided over a large area called Comancheria, which came to include large portions of present-day Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.\n Comanche power depended on bison, horses, trading, and raiding. The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile; they traded with the  Spanish,  French, Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples; and (most famously) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans.  They took captives from weaker tribes during warfare, using them as  slaves or selling them to the Spanish and (later)  Mexican settlers. They also took thousands of captives from the Spanish, Mexican, and American settlers and incorporated them into Comanche society.\n Decimated by European diseases, warfare, and encroachment by Americans on Comancheria, most Comanches were forced into life on the  reservation; a few however sought refuge with the  Mescalero Apaches in New Mexico, or with the  Kickapoos in Mexico. A number of them returned in the 1890s and early 1900s. In the 21st century, the Comanche Nation has 17,000 members, around 7,000 of whom reside in tribal jurisdictional areas around Lawton, Fort Sill, and the surrounding areas of southwestern Oklahoma. The Comanche Homecoming Annual Dance takes place annually in Walters, Oklahoma, in mid-July.\n The Comanche language is a Numic language of the  Uto-Aztecan family, sometimes classified as a Shoshoni dialect. Only about 1% of Comanches speak this language today.\n The name \"Comanche\" comes from the Ute name for the people: k\u0268mantsi (enemy),. The name Padouca, which before about 1740 was applied[by whom?] to Plains Apaches, was sometimes applied to the Comanche by French writers from the east.",
