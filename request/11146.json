It is the third largest city in Lithuania and the capital of Klaip\u0117da County.

As a result of the 1923 Klaip\u0117da Revolt it was annexed by Lithuania and has remained with Lithuania to this day, except between 1939 and 1945 when it returned to Germany following the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania and Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (between Germany and the Soviet Union). The population has shrunk from the city to its suburbs and the hinterland.
