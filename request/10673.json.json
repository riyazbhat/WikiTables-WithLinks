It is the oldest parish in the western San Fernando Valley, having been established in 1921. When the parish was established, the western Valley was sparsely populated, and most of the 620 parishioners were involved in agriculture with livestock or walnut and orange groves. At the time of its formation, the parish\u2019s boundaries covered 400 square miles (1,000\u00a0km2) from the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Ventura County line to the west, White Oak Avenue to the east, and the Santa Susana Mountains to the north. In the years after World War II, the San Fernando Valley shifted from agriculture to residential communities, and the Catholic population also swelled. The 400 square miles (1,000\u00a0km2) served by Our Lady of the Valley were carved up among nine sister parishes. Though its territory has been reduced to four square miles, the parish has grown from 620 parishioners to over 4100 families.",
