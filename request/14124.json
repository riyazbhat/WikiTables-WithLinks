  "/wiki/Hittite_language": "Hittite (natively \ud808\ude48\ud808\udd46\ud808\uddf7 ne\u0161ili  \"[in the language] of Ne\u0161a\"), also known as Nesite and Neshite, was an Indo-European language that was spoken by the Hittites, a people of Bronze Age Anatolia who created an empire, centred on Hattusa, as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. The language, now long extinct, is attested in cuneiform, in records dating from the 16th (Anitta text) to the 13th centuries BCE, with isolated Hittite loanwords and numerous personal names appearing in an Old Assyrian context from as early as the 20th century BCE.\n By the Late Bronze Age, Hittite had started losing ground to its close relative Luwian. It appears that in the 13th century BCE, Luwian was the most-widely spoken language in the Hittite capital, Hattusa. After the collapse of the Hittite Empire during the more general Late Bronze Age collapse, Luwian emerged in the Early Iron Age as the main language of the so-called Syro-Hittite states, in southwestern Anatolia and northern Syria.\n Hittite is the earliest-attested of the Indo-European languages and is the best-known of the Anatolian languages.",
  "/wiki/Simon_of_Athens": "Simon of Athens was an Athenian writer on horses and horsemanship of the fifth century BC. He is the earliest known ancient Greek writer on the subject; Pliny described him as primus de equitatu scripsit, \"the first to have written on riding\". His writings are quoted by Xenophon.",
  "/wiki/Xenophon": "Xenophon of Athens (/\u02c8z\u025bn\u0259f\u0259n, -\u02ccf\u0252n/; Greek: \u039e\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd, Ancient Greek: [ksenop\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u02d0n], Xenoph\u014dn; c.\u2009431 BC  \u2013 354 BC) was an ancient Greek historian, philosopher, soldier, mercenary, and student of Socrates. As a soldier, Xenophon became commander of the Ten Thousand at about 30, with noted military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge saying of him, \u201cthe centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the \ngenius of this warrior.\u201d  He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use flanking maneuvers, feints and attacks in depth. He was among the greatest commanders of antiquity. As a historian, Xenophon is known for recording the history of his time, the late-5th and early-4th centuries BC, in such works as the Hellenica, which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC), thus representing a thematic continuation of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War. As one of the Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries), Xenophon participated in Cyrus the Younger's failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II of Persia. He recounted the events in Anabasis, his most notable history. Like Plato, Xenophon is an authority on Socrates, about whom he wrote several books of dialogues (the Memorabilia) and an Apology of Socrates to the Jury, which recounts the philosopher's trial in 399 BC. Despite being born an Athenian citizen, Xenophon was also associated with Sparta, the traditional enemy of Athens.",
