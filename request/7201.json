The foundation stone was laid in 1829 and, in April 1834, the structure, stuccoed to resemble stone blocks, was completed. Having been completed, the building was formally handed over to a committee of the Court of Policy on 5 August 1834. Those present were Joseph Hadfield, of the Hadfield family, after one of whom, John, Hadfield Street was named; and George Booker, who represented J.D. Patterson, one of the three contractors, the other two being Roderick McKenzie and Hector Kemp. The architect was Joseph Hadfield. The building was constructed at a cost of 50,000 pounds. In 1875 Cesar Castellani completed the installation of a sunken panelled ceiling of the Parliamentary chamber in the eastern wing of the Parliament Building.",
  "/wiki/Mexico": "Mexico (Spanish: M\u00e9xico [\u02c8mexiko] (listen); Nahuatl languages: M\u0113xihco), officially the United Mexican States (UMS; Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos, EUM [es\u02c8ta\u00f0os u\u02c8ni\u00f0oz mexi\u02c8kanos] (listen), lit. Mexican United States), is a country in the southern portion of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers (770,000 sq mi), the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world. With an estimated population of over 129 million people, Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world, while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City (CDMX), which is the capital city and its most populous city. Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, and Le\u00f3n. Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec before first contact with Europeans.",
  "/wiki/Palacio_Legislativo_de_San_L\u00e1zaro": "The Legislative Palace of San L\u00e1zaro (Spanish: Palacio Legislativo de San L\u00e1zaro) is the main seat of the legislative power of the Mexican government, being the permanent meeting place of the Chamber of Deputies (equivalent to the House of Representatives or House of Commons), as well as the seat of the whole Congress of the Union, when the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) convenes in conjunction with the Senate of the Republic (the upper house; UK House of Lords equivalent). Built in the late 20th century after a 1977 political reform, the complex is located in Mexico City about a mile east of the Z\u00f3calo central square, in the Venustiano Carranza borough or district, next to the Palace of Federal Justice. The complex draws its name from its location, as the San L\u00e1zaro Railway Station was the former occupant of the grounds where the palace was built.",
