It was designated as the first capital of the Arkansas Territory in 1819, but lost that status to Little Rock in 1821. During the years of fur trading, Arkansas Post was protected by a series of forts.

  "/wiki/List_of_F5_and_EF5_tornadoes": "Among the most violent known meteorological events are tornadoes. Each year, more than 2,000\u00a0tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in the United States and Europe. In order to assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum winds within the storm based on damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale. At the top end of the scale, which ranks from 0 to 5, are F5 tornadoes. These storms were estimated to have had winds between 260\u00a0mph (420\u00a0km/h) and 318\u00a0mph (512\u00a0km/h).[nb 1] Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale. With building designs taken more into account, winds in an EF5 tornado were estimated to be in excess of 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h). Unlike North America, Europe however uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale) a scale measuring tornado intensity between T0 and T11 , F5/EF5 tornadoes for the T scale are T10-T11."
