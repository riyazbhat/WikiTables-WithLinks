  "/wiki/List_of_freshwater_islands_in_Scotland": "The freshwater islands in Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers \u2013 including tidal areas, so the islands may not always be surrounded by freshwater. It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides. [Note 1]\n The more notable freshwater islands include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf's Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have had a role to play in Scottish history. Inchmurrin, the largest freshwater island in the British Isles, is in Loch Lomond, which contains thirty or more other islands. [Note 2]\n Various names are used repeatedly. Inch  or Innis is a Scots word that can mean island (although it is also used for terra firma surrounded by marsh). Similarly, Eilean is the Gaelic for island."
