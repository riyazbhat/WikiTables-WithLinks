  "/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television": "Digital terrestrial television (DTTV or DTT, or DTTB with \"broadcasting\") is a technology for terrestrial television in which land-based (terrestrial) television stations broadcast  television content by radio waves to televisions in consumers' residences in a digital format.  DTTV is a major technological advance over the previous analog television, and has largely replaced analog which had been in common use since the middle of the 20th century. Test broadcasts began in 1998 with the changeover to DTTV (aka Analog Switchoff (ASO) or Digital Switchover (DSO)) beginning in 2006 and is now complete in many countries.   The advantages of digital terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitising platforms such as cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications: more efficient use of limited radio spectrum bandwidth, provision of more television channels than analog, better quality images, and potentially lower operating costs for broadcasters (after the initial upgrade costs).",
