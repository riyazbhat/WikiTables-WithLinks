  "/wiki/Las_Vegas_Cowboys": "The Las Vegas Cowboys were a professional American football team based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Their roots can be traced to the independent Quad Cities Raiders, who joined the new Professional Football League of America as the Rock Island Raiders in 1965. The Raiders remained in the PFLA until its merger with the Continental Football League in 1968. After losing their first two regular-season contests in 1968 (and drawing only 1,200 fans for a game in Davenport, Iowa against the Chicago Owls), the Raiders were set to play the Indianapolis Capitols in Indiana. Instead, Indianapolis businessman Thomas Redmond swiftly purchased the club and announced the team would be known as the Las Vegas Cowboys (who lost to the Caps, 41-0 on September 14.) (League records consider the Raiders and Cowboys to be separate clubs.) At the time, there was already a Las Vegas Cowboys franchise in the minor Western Football League, with Las Vegas holding a 1-1 record in that circuit; Redmond apparently merged the two franchises, forfeited the Cowboys' remaining games in the WFL, and played a Continental League schedule for the rest of 1968.

Teams were generally made up of minor league ice hockey players playing on inline skates during the summer months between ice seasons. RHI was also known for its unstable franchises and instability in the league's front office itself.
