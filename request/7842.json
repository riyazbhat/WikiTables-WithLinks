An underground passageway formerly provided an indoor connection with the 34th Street\u2013Herald Square subway station and 33rd Street PATH station.\n Penn Station is named for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), its builder and original tenant, and shares its name with several stations in other cities. The current facility is the remodeled underground remnant of the original Pennsylvania Station, a more ornate station building designed by McKim, Mead, and White and considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style. Completed in 1910, it enabled direct rail access to New York City from the south for the first time. Its head house was torn down in 1963, galvanizing the modern historic preservation movement. The rest of the station was rebuilt in the following six years, while retaining most of the rail infrastructure from the original station.\n Future plans for Penn Station include adding railway platforms at the station's south end to accommodate two proposed Gateway Program tunnels. Plans also call for adding entrances and concourses to the adjacent James A. Farley Building. The Farley Post Office was built as a companion to the 1910 station.

  "/wiki/Montclair-Boonton_Line": "The Montclair-Boonton Line is a commuter rail line of New Jersey Transit Rail Operations in the United States. It is part of the Hoboken Division. The line is a consolidation of three individual lines: the former Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad's Montclair Branch, which ran from Hoboken Terminal to Bay Street, Montclair; the Erie Railroad's Greenwood Lake Division (segment from Montclair to Mountain View-Wayne), which originally ran from the Erie's Jersey City Terminal to Greenwood Lake, NY; and the former Lackawanna Boonton Line, which ran from Hoboken to Hackettstown, New Jersey. The Montclair-Boonton line was formed when the Montclair Connection opened on September 30, 2002. The line serves 28 active rail stations in New Jersey along with New York Pennsylvania Station. It crosses through six counties, serving six stations in the township of Montclair, two in the town of Bloomfield, and one in the city of Newark. Trains along the Montclair-Boonton Line heading eastward usually originate at Hackettstown, Mount Olive, Lake Hopatcong, Dover, or Montclair State University, bound for either Hoboken Terminal or New York Penn Station. On system maps the line is colored light red and its symbol is a bird.\n For 2010, of 31 inbound and 34 outbound daily weekday trains, 21 inbound and 22 outbound Midtown Direct trains (about 66%) use the Kearny Connection to Secaucus Junction and New York Penn Station; the rest go to Hoboken Terminal. Trains to Hoboken run only at rush hour. Passengers can transfer at Secaucus Junction, Newark Broad Street Station, Montclair State University, or Dover to reach other destinations if necessary. Truncated weekend service on the Montclair-Boonton Line began on November 8, 2009, with service every two hours between Bay Street station in Montclair and Hoboken terminal, with the train making all local stops. This was an extension of existing Hoboken-to-Newark service, previously listed on the Morris & Essex timetables.\n Plans for connecting the two lines (the New York & Greenwood Lake Railroad (later the Boonton Line) and the Montclair Branch) dated back to 1929, when a rail connection through Montclair was proposed. Despite years of debate over the connection, nothing came to fruition until 1991. Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair closed in 1981, replaced by the new Bay Street station on the alignment that eventually would extend to the connection. In 1991, studies were conducted by New Jersey Transit regarding the creation of the Montclair Connection, and in 2002, after construction was completed, the Boonton Line from east of Walnut Street station to Arlington was abandoned and all trains took the new alignment via the Montclair Branch between a newly rebuilt Bay Street station and Walnut Street. Service began on September 30, 2002 and three stations on the old Boonton Line were closed, Benson Street in Glen Ridge, Rowe Street in Bloomfield, and Arlington station in Kearny.\n Besides the Montclair Connection, service was extended in 1994 from Netcong station to Hackettstown via tracks owned by Conrail (now Norfolk Southern). Stations at Roseville Avenue in Newark, Ampere in East Orange, and Great Notch in Little Falls were closed in 1984, 1991, and 2010 respectively. Two service expansions have been proposed using the under-construction branch to Andover via the Lackawanna Cut-Off (NJ Transit) project, an extension on old New York and Greenwood Lake tracks to Pompton Junction, and the New York, Susquehanna and Western.

On May 11, 2008, off-peak weekday Hoboken-Dover trains (600 Series) were cut. In addition, weekend Gladstone trains were cut back to Summit, and a shuttle train is operated every two hours between Newark Broad Street and Hoboken Terminal.\n Recently[when?] the line between Millburn and Summit underwent extensive rehabilitation. This included the replacement of the creosote crossties on both tracks with concrete crossties, the replacement of all crossties on the double trestle over Short Hills Avenue, and the replacement of several sections of rail. More recently work has been progressing briskly on rehabilitating both tracks between Summit and Dover with concrete crossties and new welded rail, and rehabilitation of select road overpasses.\n Hurricane Sandy inflicted severe damage on the Morristown Line on October 29\u201330, 2012, as fallen trees brought down catenary and signal wires and washed out sections of track, most notably through the New Jersey Meadowlands on both the main line and the Kearny Connection.

It is near Jersey Avenue, in an industrial area next to a New Jersey Transit rail yard.  Unlike all other stations on the Northeast Corridor Line, Jersey Avenue has low-level platforms (the rest are elevated), and, since there is no wheelchair ramp, it is the only station on the line that is not handicapped-accessible.  Jersey Avenue opened in October 1963 as part of an experimental park and ride program.\n Jersey Avenue has a different layout than most New Jersey Transit stations.  While it has two platforms, one for trains heading south toward Trenton Transit Center and one for trains heading north toward New York Penn Station, the northbound platform is not positioned across the track from the southbound platform as would normally be the case for most New Jersey Transit stations (especially those along the Northeast Corridor, which have a wider gap between platforms due to an extra track in each direction used by Amtrak).  Instead, the northbound platform is set behind the southbound platform and the platforms are separated by a parking lot.  With this layout, northbound trains from Trenton cannot service Jersey Avenue and thus bypass the station en route to New York.  Some southbound trains do terminate at Jersey Avenue, using a siding that is also used by special northbound trains that originate at the station.\n In April 2014 NJT approved a contract for a design for relocation and rebuilding the station platform to permit high-level boarding, along with pedestrian overpass, vertical circulation, improved parking, and bus connection areas, as well as improvements to 5 miles of the existing Delco freight line to make it a 130 kilometers per hour (80 miles per hour) main line track for passenger trains.

  "/wiki/List_of_NJ_Transit_railroad_stations": "NJ Transit Rail Operations (NJTR) provides passenger service on 12 lines at a total of 166 stations, some operated in conjunction with Amtrak and Metro-North (MNR).\n NJTR was established by NJ Transit (NJT) to run commuter rail operations in New Jersey. In January 1983 it took over operation from Conrail (CR), which itself had been formed in 1976 through the merger of a number of financially troubled railroads and had been operating commuter railroad service under contract from the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). Soon after it was created, NJT commissioned a survey of operating stations, 53 of which were eventually nominated and listed on the state and federal registers of historic places in 1984. Since 2009, NJT is a stakeholder in the state's \"smart growth\" transit-oriented development (TOD) initiatives, its transit hubs forming the basis for transit villages.\n The regional rail network, which serves the northern and central parts of New Jersey and Rockland and Orange counties in New York, radiates from Hoboken, Midtown Manhattan, and Newark. Lines intersect at Secaucus Junction. Service from Atlantic City and south from Trenton, is provided by one NJTR and two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) regional rail lines to Center City, Philadelphia. Amtrak provides service in New Jersey along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Newark and Trenton and at intermediate points.\n Since its inception, NJT has closed several stations and opened new ones reflecting infrastructure improvements and discontinuance or additions in service. Some station locations, not listed here, became part of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) and the River Line, which were largely built along existing railroad rights-of-way. New and re-opened stations are being built or proposed along planned expansions and extensions, notably the Lackawanna Cut-Off, which is under reconstruction. Restoration of passenger service along the West Trenton Line, Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex project right-of-ways, and the Raritan Valley/Lehigh Line, which include the reactivation/construction of new stations, has been considered but not advanced."
