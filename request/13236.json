  "/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale": "The Richter scale \u2013 also called the Richter magnitude scale or Richter's magnitude scale\u2013 for measuring the strength of earthquakes refers to the original magnitude scale (as the author called it) developed by Charles F. Richter and presented in his landmark 1935 paper. This was later revised[how?] and renamed the local magnitude scale, denoted as ML or ML\u202f. Because of various shortcomings of the ML\u202f scale most seismological authorities now use other scales, such as the moment magnitude scale (Mw\u202f), to report earthquake magnitudes, but much of the news media still refers to these as Richter magnitudes. All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic character of the original and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values (typically in the middle of the scale).",
