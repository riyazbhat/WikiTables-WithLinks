  "/wiki/Can_(band)": "Can (stylised as CAN) was a German experimental rock band formed in Cologne in 1968 by the core quartet of Holger Czukay (bass, tape editing), Irmin Schmidt (keyboards), Michael Karoli (guitar), and Jaki Liebezeit (drums). The group cycled through several vocalists, most prominently the American-born Malcolm Mooney (1968\u201370) and the Japanese-born Damo Suzuki (1970\u201373), as well as various temporary members.\n Coming from backgrounds in the avant-garde and jazz, the members of Can blended elements of psychedelic rock, funk, and noise on influential albums such as Tago Mago (1971), Ege Bamyasi (1972) and Future Days (1973). Can also had occasional commercial success, with singles such as \"Spoon\" and \"I Want More\" reaching national singles charts. They have been widely hailed as pioneers of the German krautrock scene, and a considerable influence on subsequent rock, post-punk, ambient, and electronic music.",
  "/wiki/Vitamin_C_(song)": "\"Vitamin C\" is a song by the krautrock band Can on their 1972 album Ege Bamyasi. Considering its short length and relatively standard song structure, it is one of the band's more conventional songs.[citation needed]\n It was featured in Samuel Fuller's German television Tatort production Kressin & die tote Taube auf der Beethovenstra\u00dfe (Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street) in 1973, and then also released as a single with the B-side \"I'm So Green\".\n In 1997, an 8-minute version of the song, remixed by British musical outfit U.N.K.L.E., was featured on Can's double remix album Sacrilege.\n Vitamin C was featured in the opening of Paul Thomas Anderson's 2014 film Inherent Vice.\n An interpolation of a keyboard sample from the song was used in Brooklyn band Woods' 2016 song \"Can't See at All\".\n The song was also featured as the theme song for Jaden Smith's character 'Dizzee' throughout the Netflix series The Get Down.\n In 2018 the DJs Adam Beyer & Bart Skils released their track \"Your mind\" which features the famous songtext \"Hey you! You're losing, you're losing...\" but instead of \"vitamin C\" the lyrics were altered to \"your mind\".\n In JoJolion, the eighth part of the long-running Manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Damo Tamaki's stand, \"Vitamin C\", is named after the song. The character of Damo Tamaki is also a reference to Damo Suzuki.",

  "/wiki/Tangerine_Dream": "Tangerine Dream is a German electronic music band founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese having been the only continuous member until his death in January 2015. The best-known lineup of the group was its mid-'70s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In the late 1970s, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann. Since Froese's death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning (Froese's chosen successor and the current longest-serving band member, having joined in 2005).\n Tangerine Dream are considered pioneers of the early days of electronica. Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische (\"cosmic\"). Their \"Virgin Years\", so called because of their association with Virgin Records, produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers, including the UK top 20 albums Phaedra (1974) and Rubycon (1975). The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores, which include those for the films Sorcerer, Thief, Risky Business, The Keep, Firestarter, Legend, Three O'Clock High, Near Dark, Shy People, and Miracle Mile.\n From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music as well as electronica. Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new age (although the band themselves disliked the term) and electronic dance music.\n Their most recent album, Recurring Dreams, was released on 31 January 2020 through Kscope.",

Her first major discovery was that pattern formation and growth are regulated by the same mechanism. By a study of genetic mosaics she demonstrated that cells develop into particular structures by means of local interactions with their neighbours.\n She has made major contributions to the understanding of the process of lateral inhibition, whereby initially equivalent cells interact between themselves and subsequently adopt different fates. \nThis process involves a conserved cellular receptor and is equally important in mammals; the work can be related to studies on human development and disease.",

  "/wiki/Tatort": "Tatort (Crime scene) is a German language police procedural television series that has been running continuously since 1970 with some 30 feature-length episodes per year, which makes it the longest-running German TV drama. Developed by the German public-service broadcasting organisation ARD for their channel Das Erste, it is unique in its approach, in that it is jointly produced by all of the organisation's regional members as well as its partnering Austrian and Swiss national public-service broadcasters, whereby every regional station contributes a number of episodes to a common pool.\n Therefore, the series is a collection of different police stories where different police teams each solve crimes in their respective city. Uniqueness in architecture, customs and dialects of the cities is therefore a distinctive part of the series and often the city, not the police force is the real main character of an episode. The concept of local stations only producing a couple of shows per year has also enabled the shows to be longer (90 minutes) and more fleshed out psychologically than other weekly TV dramas.\n The first episode was broadcast on 29 November 1970. Episodes are broadcast on ARD's main channel Das Erste on Sunday evening at the prime viewing time of 8.15 pm (just after the 8 o'clock Tagesschau news) around three times a month. Reruns are often shown by various regional ARD stations and on foreign broadcasters. Next to the member stations of the ARD, the National Austrian broadcasting corporation \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk joined the production pool in 1971 and airs the program on its ORF 2 channel. Switzerland's Schweizer Fernsehen joined the pool from 1990 to 2001 and again in 2011 and distributes its episodes through its channel SRF 1.\n The series Polizeiruf 110, which was produced by East Germany\u2019s state TV broadcaster as a counterpart to the West German Tatort and has a similar regional production approach, is still produced by ARD's regional broadcasters Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB), Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) and Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR). Polizeiruf 110 shares the Sunday night prime time slot on Das Erste with Tatort."
