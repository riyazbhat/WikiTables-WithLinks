  "/wiki/Epigallocatechin": "Gallocatechol or gallocatechin (GC) is a flavan-3-ol, a type of chemical compound including catechin, with the gallate residue being in an isomeric trans position. It is one of the antioxidant chemicals found in food. This compound possesses two epimers. The most common, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), CAS number 970-73-0, is found notably in green tea. Other sources of (+)-gallocatechin are bananas, persimmons, and pomegranates. [citation needed] The other enantiomer is called (-)-gallocatechin or ent-gallocatechin. It was first isolated from green tea by Michiyo Tsujimura in 1934. This compound had been shown to have moderate affinity to the human cannabinoid receptor, which may contribute to the health benefits found by consuming green tea.",
  "/wiki/Prodelphinidin": "Prodelphinidin is a name for the polymeric tannins composed of gallocatechin. It yields delphinidin during depolymerisation under oxidative conditions.",
  "/wiki/Epicatechin_gallate": "Epicatechin gallate (ECG) is a flavan-3-ol, a type of flavonoid, present in green tea. It is also reported in buckwheat and in grape.\n The tea component epicatechin gallate is being researched because in vitro experiments showed it can reverse methicillin resistance in bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.  Nevertheless, the compound is significantly degraded by steeping in boiling water, unlike related catechins.\n Epicatechin, as well as many other flavonoids, has been found to act as a non-selective antagonist of the opioid receptors, albeit with somewhat low affinity.",
  "/wiki/Epigallocatechin_gallate": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), also known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, is the ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid, and is a type of catechin.\n EGCG, the most abundant catechin in tea, is a polyphenol under basic research for its potential to affect human health and disease.  EGCG is used in many dietary supplements.\n EGCG is a second-order modulator of the GABAA receptor[citation needed].",

  "/wiki/Flavan-3-ol": "Flavan-3-ols (sometimes referred to as flavanols) are derivatives of flavans that possess a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol skeleton. These compounds include catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, theaflavins, thearubigins. Flavanols (with an \"a\") are not to be confused with flavonols (with an \"o\"), a class of flavonoids containing a ketone group. The single-molecule (monomer) catechin, or isomer epicatechin (see diagram), adds four hydroxyls to flavan-3-ol, making building blocks for concatenated polymers (proanthocyanidins) and higher order polymers (anthocyanidins). Flavanols possess two chiral carbons, meaning four diastereoisomers occur for each of them. Catechins are distinguished from the yellow, ketone-containing flavonoids such as quercitin and rutin, which are called flavonols. Early use of the term bioflavonoid was imprecisely applied to include the flavanols, which are distinguished by absence of ketone(s). Catechin monomers, dimers, and trimers (oligomers) are colorless."
