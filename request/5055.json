  "/wiki/Cathedral_Valley_Corral": "The Cathedral Valley Corral was constructed around 1900 by local cattlemen in the northern portion of what is now Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. It is one of the oldest examples of ranching use in the park. It coincided with a change in the use of the land, where cattle were grazed on the open range and collected into corrals for branding, vaccination and other procedures. The extensive use of open-range grazing practices led to the de-vegetation of portions of the area. The corral was used by the Jeffery and Morrel families. The corral site uses sandstone cliffs as part of the enclosure, with a wood fence closing off an alcove in a cliff. The pen is subdivided into a larger and smaller enclosure, with a cattle chute off the small pen. The Cathedral Valley Corral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1999.",
  "/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps_Powder_Magazine": "The Civilian Conservation Corps Powder Magazine in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, was used in the 1930s to store explosives for use by Civilian Conservation Corps laborers in the construction of improvements to the park. Much of the CCC's work in the park involved the quarrying of sandstone blocks and slabs, which required explosives. The magazine was built about 1938 in association with CCC Camp NM-2, later called NP-6, located to the west of Fruita at Chimney Rock. The Fruita ranger station and the powder magazine are the only structures remaining from the CCC tenure in the park. The magazine consists of a single room, partially built into a hillside. Walls are native red sandstone, coursed, with a stone slab for a roof. The building measures 10.5 feet (3.2 m) by 7.5 feet (2.3 m), with a dirt floor. The magazine was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1999.",

  "/wiki/Capitol_Reef_National_Park": "Capitol Reef National Park is an American national park in south-central Utah. The park is approximately 60 miles (97 km) long on its north-south axis and just 6 miles (9.7 km) wide on average. The park was established in 1971 to preserve 241,904 acres (377.98 sq mi; 97,895.08 ha; 978.95 km2) of desert landscape and is open all year, with May through September being the highest visitation months. Partially in Wayne County, Utah, the area was originally named Wayne Wonderland in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman. Capitol Reef National Park was designated a national monument on August 2, 1937, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to protect the area's colorful canyons, ridges, buttes, and monoliths; however, it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public. Road access was improved in 1962 with the construction of State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon. The majority of the nearly 100 mi (160 km) long up-thrust formation called the Waterpocket Fold - a rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powell - is preserved within the park. Capitol Reef is an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River. The park was named for its whitish Navajo Sandstone cliffs with dome formations - similar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildings - that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. Locally, reef refers to any rocky barrier to land travel, just as ocean reefs are barriers to sea travel.",
  "/wiki/Hanks'_Dugouts": "The Hanks' Dugouts are a series of pioneer dwellings in southern Utah, in what is now Capitol Reef National Park. The dugouts were constructed as temporary housing for the Ephraim K. Hanks family, Mormon pioneers who established the now-vanished Floral Ranch on Pleasant Creek in April 1883. The remains of three dugouts and one other structure remain at the site. All above-ground construction has collapsed. The dugouts were abandoned in 1888 when the Hankses built a four-room frame house, although the homestead claim of Hanks' widow claims that a one-room log house was built at the time of settlement. The site includes debris such as ceramic and glass, and pieces of a wagon. The settlement reflects a typical early Mormon homestead of the time. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1999.",
  "/wiki/Lesley_Morrell_Line_Cabin_and_Corral": "The Leslie Morrell Line Cabin and Corral are located in the Cathedral Valley section of northern Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. The cabin was built in the 1920s on Lake Creek by Paul Christensen at his sawmill as a summer residence for Christensen and his family. Christensen sold the cabin to Leslie H. Morrell around 1935, who took the cabin apart and rebuilt it at its present site for use as a winter camp for cowboys on the Morrell ranch. The use continued until 1970 when the area was sold to the National Park Service. It is one of the best-preserved relics of ranching activities in the park. The cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1999."
