  "/wiki/SR_Montenegro": "The Socialist Republic of Montenegro (Serbo-Croatian: Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora / \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430) was one of the six republics forming the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is a predecessor of the modern-day Montenegro. On 7 July 1963, the People's Republic of Montenegro (Serbo-Croatian: Narodna Republika Crna Gora / \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430) was renamed the Socialist Republic of Montenegro (a change ratified both by the Federal Constitution and the newly created Montenegrin Constitution in 1963) with Serbo-Croatian as the official language. In 1991, as the League of Communists in Montenegro changed its name to Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro after the first free elections, the adjective Socialist was deleted from the republic's title (ratified by the 1992 Constitution)."
