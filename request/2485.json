The Gylfaginning deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Norse gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology.

It is a listing in verse of names that may be used in poetry for various items, such as gods, giants, people, animals, and weapons. The verses are not in all manuscripts of the Edda and appear independently, and are probably a later addition to Snorri's original composition; they may have been one of its sources. They are often omitted from editions and translations of the Edda.",

Gefjon is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in the works of skalds; and appears as a gloss for various Greco-Roman goddesses in some Old Norse translations of Latin works.",

It is a food and fiber crop cultivated in cooler regions of the world. Textiles made from flax are known in the Western countries as linen, and traditionally used for bed sheets, underclothes, and table linen. Its oil is known as linseed oil.  In addition to referring to the plant itself, the word \"flax\" may refer to the unspun fibers of the flax plant. The plant species is known only as a cultivated plant, and appears to have been domesticated just once from the wild species Linum bienne, called pale flax.",

Dellingr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Dellingr is described as the father of Dagr, the personified day. The Prose Edda adds that, depending on manuscript variation, he is either the third husband of N\u00f3tt, the personified night, or the husband of J\u00f6r\u00f0, the personified earth. Dellingr is also attested in the legendary saga Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks.

Heimdallr is said to be the originator of social classes among humanity and once regained Freyja's treasured possession Br\u00edsingamen while doing battle in the shape of a seal with Loki.

  "/wiki/Br%C3%ADsingamen": "In Norse mythology, Br\u00edsingamen (or Br\u00edsinga men) is the torc or necklace of the goddess Freyja. The name is an Old Norse compound br\u00edsinga-men whose second element is men \"(ornamental) neck-ring (of precious metal), torc\". The etymology of the first element is uncertain. It has been derived from Old Norse br\u00edsingr, a poetic term for \"fire\" or \"amber\" mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists (\u00feulur) appended to many manuscripts of the Prose Edda, making Br\u00edsingamen \"gleaming torc\", \"sunny torc\", or the like. However, Br\u00edsingr can also be an ethnonym, in which case Br\u00edsinga men is \"torque of the Br\u00edsings\"; the Old English parallel in Beowulf supports this derivation, though who the Br\u00edsings (Old Norse Br\u00edsingar) may have been remains unknown.",
  "/wiki/Wild_boar": "The wild boar (Sus scrofa), also known as the wild swine, Eurasian wild pig, or simply wild pig, is a suid native to much of Eurasia, North Africa, and the Greater Sunda Islands. Human intervention has spread its distribution further, making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widely spread suiform. Its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability mean that it is classed as least concern by the IUCN and it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. The animal probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene, and outcompeted other suid species as it spread throughout the Old World.",

The origin of a number of kennings is given; then Bragi delivers a systematic list of kennings for various people, places and things. He then goes on to discuss poetic language in some detail, in particular heiti, the concept of poetical words which are non-periphrastic (like steed for horse), and again systematises these. This in a way forms an early form of poetic thesaurus.",

  "/wiki/D%C3%ADs": "In Norse mythology, a d\u00eds (\"lady\", plural d\u00edsir) is a ghost, spirit or deity associated with fate who can be either benevolent or antagonistic towards mortals. D\u00edsir may act as protective spirits of Norse clans. Their original function was possibly that of fertility goddesses who were the object of both private and official worship called d\u00edsabl\u00f3t, and their veneration may derive from the worship of the spirits of the dead. The d\u00edsir, like the valkyries, norns, and v\u00e6ttir, are almost always referred to collectively. The North Germanic d\u00edsir and West Germanic Idisi are believed by some scholars to be related due to linguistic and mythological similarities, but the direct evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Continental German mythology is limited. The d\u00edsir play roles in Norse texts that resemble those of fylgjur, valkyries, and norns, so that some have suggested that d\u00edsir is a broad term including the other beings.",

By her husband \u00d3\u00f0r, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her brother Freyr, her father Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and her mother (Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja."
