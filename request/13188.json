In 1899, Bourassa was outspoken against the British government's request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier's compromise was to send a volunteer force, but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the World Wars of the next half-century. Bourassa challenged, unsuccessfully, the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire. He led the opposition to mandatory conscription during World War I, arguing that Canada's interests were not at stake. He opposed Catholic bishops who defended military support of Britain and its allies. Bourassa was an ideological father of French-Canadian nationalism.",

  "/wiki/2007_Quebec_general_election": "The 2007 Quebec general election was held in the Canadian province of Quebec on March 26, 2007 to elect members of the 38th National Assembly of Quebec. The Quebec Liberal Party led by Premier Jean Charest managed to win a plurality of seats, but were reduced to a minority government, Quebec's first in 129 years, since the 1878 general election. The Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec, in a major breakthrough, became the official opposition. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was relegated to third-party status for the first time since the 1973 election. The Liberals won their lowest share of the popular vote since Confederation, and the PQ with their 28.35% of the votes cast won their lowest share since 1973 and their second lowest ever (ahead of only the 23.06% attained in their initial election campaign in 1970). Each of the three major parties won nearly one-third of the popular vote, the closest three-way split in Quebec electoral history until the 2012 election. Voter turnout among those eligible was 71.23%, a marginal difference from the previous general election in 2003.\n This was the first time since the 1970s that a government was not returned for its second term with a majority.",
  "/wiki/Action_d\u00e9mocratique_du_Qu\u00e9bec": "The Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec (Democratic Action of Quebec), commonly referred to as the ADQ was a right-wing populist and conservative provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. On the sovereignty question, it defined itself as autonomist, and had support from nationalists and federalists. Its members were referred to as ad\u00e9quistes, a name derived from the French pronunciation of the initials 'ADQ'. The party was founded by dissidents of the Quebec Liberal Party who did not accept the Charlottetown Accord, and first contested the 1994 provincial election, electing Mario Dumont to the National Assembly. Under longtime leader Dumont, the ADQ had a strong showing in the 2007 provincial election, reducing the ruling Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ) to a minority government and relegating the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) to third place. The ADQ won 41 seats with 31% of the popular vote to serve as the Official Opposition in the National Assembly. However, the ADQ's popularity declined significantly soon afterward and in the 2008 provincial elections, the party failed to secure at least twenty percent of the popular vote or twelve Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) in the last election, and consequently lost official party status, though in early 2009 it was recognised as an official party by the PLQ and the PQ. On 21 January 2012, the membership approved a merger with the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec.",
