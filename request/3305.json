In modern Greek politics, New Democracy has been the main centre-right political party and one of the two major parties along with its historic rival, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). New Democracy, alongside PASOK, were created in the wake of the toppling of the military junta in 1974, which ruled Greece alternately for the previous four decades. Following the electoral decline of PASOK, New Democracy remained one of the two major parties in Greece, the other being the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA). Having spent four and a half years in opposition to SYRIZA's government, New Democracy regained its majority in the Hellenic Parliament and returned to government under Kyriakos Mitsotakis after the 2019 legislative election. The traditional support of New Democracy comes from an electorate leaning to the right and conservatives. From a geographical perspective, its main support base is in the rural areas of Greece as well as the city centers of Athens and Thessaloniki. Its support is generally weak in areas like West Greece, Attica, Crete and the Aegean Islands.",

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain, and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9, meli, honey. The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 (Melit\u0113) meaning honey-sweet, possibly for Malta's unique production of honey; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island. The Romans called the island Melita, which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1. In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin. Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized (King James) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901. Malta is widely used in more recent versions, such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973.
