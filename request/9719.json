  "/wiki/Freethought": "Freethought (or free thought) is an epistemological viewpoint which holds that positions regarding truth should be formed only on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a freethinker is \"a person who forms their own ideas and opinions rather than accepting those of other people, especially in religious teaching.\" In some contemporary thought in particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems. The cognitive application of freethought is known as \"freethinking\", and practitioners of freethought are known as \"freethinkers\". Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom from all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society. The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs. In practice, freethinking is most closely linked with secularism, atheism, agnosticism, anti-clericalism, and religious critique. The Oxford English Dictionary defines freethinking as, \"The free exercise of reason in matters of religious belief, unrestrained by deference to authority; the adoption of the principles of a free-thinker.\"",
