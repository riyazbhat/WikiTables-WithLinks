Over the years he has invested heavily in both racing and breeding and has acquired major operations in England, Ireland and the United States.\n He owns eight stud farms worldwide containing over 200 regally bred mares and many top stallions. Six of these are in the county of Suffolk, England, three near Thetford \u2013 Nunnery, Melton and Snarehill Studs \u2013 plus the Salsabil Stud near Bury St. Edmunds, Elmswell Park Stud and Beech House Stud just outside Newmarket. The other two are Derrinstown Stud in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland  and the 3200 acre Shadwell Farm near Lexington, Kentucky.\n The Nunnery Stud is where the whole British breeding operation is controlled and currently standing there are Aqlaam, Nayef, Mawatheeq and Sakhee, as well as Green Desert, now pensioned. In the past Nashwan, Unfuwain and Haafhd also stood there. Beech House Stud is used as a base for Shadwell's private mares, both Thoroughbred and Arabian. The paddocks are also used to winter the private Arabian young stock before they are broken in at Snarehill. Elmswell Park Stud and Salsabil Stud are located deep in the Suffolk countryside. These operations together look after Sheikh Hamdan's private mares. It is here that the mares are cared for prior to foaling, and then once they have foaled they stay until they return to Ireland with their foals in the late summer. The quiet surroundings of Salsabil Stud are ideal for the mares and foals at this early stage of the foals' development. The Snarehill Stud is used as a base for breaking in the young Thoroughbreds. It is also used for rest and rehabilitation for horses in training. Finally there is Melton Paddocks which was originally the public stud before the building of the Nunnery Stud, but now it houses the Arabian stallions.\n The Shadwell Farm in Lexington, Kentucky was constructed in 1985. At the farm's stallion division, Nashwan Stud, currently stand Albertus Maximus, Daaher, Mohaymen and Tamarkuz.\n The stud currently stands Alhaarth, Arcano, Elnadim, Haatef, Intikhab and Tamayuz.\n This investment has translated to great success on the race track. He was the British flat racing Champion Owner in 1990, 1995, 2002, and 2005. He has enjoyed over 50 Group 1 wins in Europe in addition to big race success in America, Australia and Dubai. His leading horses have ranged from sprinting champions such as Dayjur and Hamas, champion milers like Lahib and Bahri to great middle distance runners such as Nashwan, Unfuwain, Haafhd, Nayef, Jazil and Invasor. This is in addition to racing several classic winning fillies who have gone on to be great broodmares. The most famous being Salsabil who topped winning the Epsom Oaks by beating the colts in the Irish Derby. Shadwell's most famous broodmare is Height of Fashion who was sold by Queen Elizabeth II to Sheikh Hamdan Al-Maktoum after setting a new course record in the Princess of Wales' Stakes. She was the dam of Nashwan, Nayef and Unfuwain. She is also the grand dam of Ghanaati through her daughter Sarayir.\n In England he currently has approximately 200 horses in training spread over a number of trainers including Michael Stoute, John Dunlop, John Gosden, William Haggas, Marcus Tregoning, Ed Dunlop and Mark Johnston. In the past he sent horses with great success to Dick Hern, Michael Jarvis, Barry Hills, Alec Stewart and Harry Thomson Jones. In Ireland he has sent his horses for many years to Kevin Prendergrast and Dermot Weld and likewise in France to Freddy Head.

It is located in the townland of Ballymacoll, approximately two miles from the village of Dunboyne and four miles (6 km) from the town of Maynooth. Under the ownership of Michael Sobell and Arnold Weinstock and his family, it produced 29 individual Group One (G1) winners of 52 Group 1 races between 1960 and 2017. The stud was sold at auction in June 2017 for \u20ac8.15 million to an undisclosed buyer.\n Ballymacoll Estate was founded by Henry Hamilton (1760\u20131844). It remained in Hamilton hands until January 1911, when it was sold to Lord Nugent. Other owners and tenants followed, including Boss Croker, the trainer, the Inchape Family, and the Irish Army (during World War II).\n In April 1946, the property was purchased by the Hon. Dorothy Paget, daughter of Lord Queenborough and Pauline (daughter of William C. Whitney). She owned the stud until her death in February 1960 at the age of 54. Despite owning the stud, Dorothy Paget never actually visited the farm herself, but she did from time to time receive detailed reports, illustrated with photographs.\t\n Sir Gordon Richards, had been Dorothy Paget's principal jockey and trainer, right up the time of her death. He was instrumental in persuading the then Mr. Michael Sobell, the industrialist and philanthropist (later Sir Michael Sobell), and his son-in-law, Sir Arnold Weinstock, Managing Director of G.E.C. (later Lord Weinstock) to buy the farm in June 1960. The price agreed for the 300-acre (1.2 km2) farm, together with approximately 130 horses was \u00a3250,000.\n Following the purchase, horses surplus to requirements were sold at the Newmarket sales that year. In 1967 the main house at Ballymacoll, which had stood semi-derelict for many years was demolished.\n In 1974 Lord Weinstock's son, the Hon. Simon Weinstock became a partner in Ballymacoll with his father. Simon took a very active role in the running of the stud and took particular responsibility for the matings. Simon Weinstock died in May 1996, at the age of 44. Lord Weinstock died in July 2002, after which the stud was run by Weinstock's executors on behalf of his family as a self-sufficient operation. Soon after his death Islington won her first Group 1 race when winning the Nassau Stakes. She went on to win three more Group 1 races in 2002 and 2003. In 2004 North Light won the Epsom Derby to give the stud and Weinstock family their second success in this race.\n In recent years Ballymacoll have had added to their Group 1 record on the racetrack. In June 2008 Ballymacoll finished second in The Derby with Tartan Bearer. Conduit went on to win the St Leger at Doncaster in September. He then added to his Group 1 tally by winning the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita in October. In 2009 Conduit continued his Group 1 trail by winning the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.
