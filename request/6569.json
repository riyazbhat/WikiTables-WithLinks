  "/wiki/Bad_Religion": "Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have since rejoined, and guitarist Brian Baker has performed with the group since 1994. The most recent additions to the band are guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller, who joined in 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.\n By the time they were signed to Atlantic Records in 1993, Bad Religion had built an underground following with their early albums, including Suffer (1988), No Control (1989), Against the Grain (1990) and Generator (1992). The band first reached substantial commercial success with their seventh studio album and Atlantic debut Recipe for Hate (1993), which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, and spawned one of their most popular songs \"American Jesus\". Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction (1994), which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and the re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis (in response to the success of the label's then-artists the Offspring and Rancid), and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since Gurewitz's return to the band and their split with Atlantic in 2001, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album, Age of Unreason, was released on May 3, 2019.",

It was the band's final release to feature drummer Matt Pelissier, who would later be replaced by Bob Bryar.\nGerard Way, the lead singer of the band, who also designed its artwork, has described the album as a \"pseudo-conceptual horror story\", stating that it is \"the story of a man and a woman who are separated by death in a gunfight and he goes to hell only to realize by the devil telling him that she's still alive. The devil says he can be with her again if he brings the devil the souls of a thousand evil men and the man agrees to do it, and so the devil hands him a gun. That was the idea behind the concept, the record ended up being much more about loss and real life than anything, so I would say it's a good split.\"\n The album was a success for both the band and the label, The record produced several radio singles and popular MTV videos, including \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"Helena,\" and \"The Ghost of You.\" The four singles from the album included \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\", \"Helena\", \"The Ghost of You\", and in the United Kingdom, \"Thank You for the Venom\".
