  "/wiki/Off-White": "Shades of white are colors that differ only slightly from pure white.  Variations of white include what are commonly termed off-white colors, which may be considered part of a neutral color scheme.\n In color theory, a shade is a pure color mixed with black (or having a lower lightness). Strictly speaking, a \u201cshade of white\u201d would be a neutral  beige.  This article is also about off-white colors that vary from pure white in hue, and in chroma (also called saturation, or intensity).\n Colors often considered \"shades of white\" include  cream, eggshell, ivory, Navajo white, and vanilla.  Even the lighting of a room, however, can cause a pure white to be perceived as off-white.\n Off-white colors were pervasively paired with beiges in the 1930s, and especially popular again from roughly 1955 to 1975.\nWhiteness measures the degree to which a surface is white in colorimetry.",

Its 3,748,148 (2018) inhabitants make it the  most populous city proper of the European Union. The city is one of Germany's 16 federal states. It is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. The two cities are at the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region, which is, with about six million inhabitants and an area of more than 30,000\u00a0km\u00b2, Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.\n \n Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree, which flows into the River Havel (a tributary of the River Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel, and Dahme rivers (the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcggelsee).

Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961\u20131989) and East German territory. East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\n Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, research facilities, media corporations and convention venues.

It was renamed Shimer College in 1950, when it began offering a four-year curriculum based on the Hutchins Plan of the University of Chicago.

The college left Mount Carroll for Waukegan in 1978, moving to Chicago in 2006.  It was acquired by North Central College in 2017.\n Its academic program was based on a core curriculum of sixteen required courses in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. All courses were small seminars with no more than twelve students, and are based on original sources from a list of about 200 core texts broadly based on the Great Books canon. Classroom instruction was Socratic discussion. Considerable writing was required, including two comprehensive examinations and a senior thesis. Students were admitted primarily on the basis of essays and interviews; no minimum grades or test scores were required. Shimer had one of the highest alumni doctorate rates in the country.\n While in Chicago, Shimer occupied a complex designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe on the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago's Near South Side.
