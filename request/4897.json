  "/wiki/Court_of_Appeals_of_the_Philippines": "The Court of Appeals (Filipino: Hukuman ng Apelasyon) is the second-highest judicial court in the Philippines, next to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals consists of 1 Presiding Justice and 68 Associate Justices. Pursuant to the Constitution, the Court of Appeals reviews not only the decisions and orders of the Regional Trial Courts nationwide but also those of the Court of Tax Appeals, as well as the awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of, or authorized by twenty-one (21) quasi-judicial agencies exercising quasi-judicial functions mentioned in Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, plus the National Amnesty Commission (Pres. Proclamation No. 347 of 1994) and the Office of the Ombudsman (Fabian v. Desierto, 295 SCRA 470). Under Republic Act No. 9282, which elevated the Court of Tax Appeals to the same level of the Court of Appeals, en banc decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals are now subject to review by the Supreme Court instead of the Court of Appeals (as opposed to what is currently provided in Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court). Added to the formidable list are the decisions and resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission which are now initially reviewable by the Court of Appeals, instead of a direct recourse to the Supreme Court, via petition for certiorari under Rule 65 (St. Martin Funeral Homes v. National Labor Relations Commission, 295 SCRA 414).",

  "/wiki/Osiedle": "Osiedle [\u0254\u02c8\u0255\u025bdl\u025b] (Polish plural: osiedla) is a term used in Poland to denote a designated subdivision of a city or town, or of a dzielnica, with its own council and executive. Like the dzielnica and so\u0142ectwo, an osiedle is an auxiliary unit (jednostka pomocnicza) of a gmina. These units are created by decision of the gmina council, and do not have legal personality in their own right. In the case of an urban-rural gmina, it is also possible for a whole town to be designated an auxiliary unit.\n Not all Polish cities or towns have osiedles in the above sense. However the word osiedle is also frequently used to denote any housing estate or development.
