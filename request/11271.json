It is administered by the Intramuros Administration (IA) with the help of the Local Government of Manila. IA was created through the Presidential Decree No. 1616 signed on April 10, 1979. IA is tasked to rebuild, redevelop, administer and preserve the remaining pre-war buildings, structures and fortifications of Intramuros.\n Intramuros is also called the Walled City, and at the time of the Spanish Empire was synonymous with the City of Manila. Other towns and arrabales (suburbs) located beyond the walls are referred to as \"extramuros\", Latin for \"outside the walls\". It was the seat of government and political power when the Philippines was a component realm of the Spanish Empire. It was also the center of religion, education and economy. The standard way of life in Intramuros became the standard way of life throughout the Philippines. The Manila galleons, which sailed the Pacific for 250 years, carried goods to and from Intramuros (Manila) and Acapulco, Mexico.\n Construction of the defensive walls was started by the Spanish imperial government in the late 16th century to protect the city from foreign invasions.  The Walled City was originally located along the shores of the Manila Bay, south of the entrance to Pasig River. Guarding the old city is Fort Santiago, its citadel located at the mouth of the river. Land reclamations during the early 20th century subsequently obscured the walls and fort from the bay. The Battle of Manila in 1945 devastated Intramuros. It is the place where the occupying Japanese Imperial Army made their last stand against Allied soldiers and Filipino guerrillas. The battle destroyed its churches, universities, houses, and government buildings, most of which dated back to the Spanish Colonial Period.",

  "/wiki/Gomburza": "Gomburza, alternatively spelled GOMBURZA or GomBurZa, refers to three Filipino Catholic priests (Mariano G\u00f3mez, Jos\u00e9 Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora), who were executed on  February 17, 1872 at Bagumbayan, Philippines by Spanish colonial authorities on charges of subversion arising from the 1872 Cavite mutiny. The name is a portmanteau of the priests' surnames. \n Mariano Gomez de los Angeles is one of the known Catholic priest during their time, for he is part of the accused trio of mutiny by Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines in the 19th century. Gomez was the child of Alejandro Francisco Gomez and Martina Custodia. He was born in the suburb of Santa Cruz, Manila on August 2, 1799. He was a Tornatras, one born of mixed native (Filipino), Chinese and Spanish ancestries. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, and later studied theology in the University of Santo Tomas, preparing himself for the priesthood in the Seminary of Manila. Gomez was designated as the head priest of Bacoor, Cavite on June 2, 1824. He also taught agriculture and cottage industries, aside from taking care spiritual necessities. He fought for the rights of his fellow native priest against Spanish abuses. He was also active in the publication of the newspaper La Verdad. On February 17, 1872, he was one of the executed priest due to the false accusation of treason and sedition, taking active in the Cavite Mutiny and was later on sentenced to death by garrote in a military court at Bagumbayan field.[citation needed]\n On the other hand, Jose Burgos  was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur on February 9, 1837 and was baptized on the 12th of the same month. His parents were Jose Burgos, a Spanish lieutenant in the Spanish militia of Ilocos, and Florencia Garcia, a native of Vigan. During his early teenage years, he studied at the Colegio San Juan de Letran and later on went to University of Santo Tomas and received the degrees of Bachelor of Philosophy in 1855, Bachelor of Theology in 1859, Licentiate in Philosophy in 1860, Licentiate in Theology in 1862, and Doctor of Theology and Doctor of Canon Law in 1868.\nJacinto Zamora was born on August 14, 1835 in Pandacan, Manila. His parents were Venancio Zamora\u00a0 and Hilario del Rosario. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and graduated with a degree of Bachiller en Artes, and later transferred to the University of Santo Tomas and obtained a degree of Bachelor of Canon and Civil Laws and later prepared for the priesthood in the Seminary of Manila. He had dreamt of becoming a priest at a young age. After being given ministerial and priestly authority, Zamora was able to establish parishes in Marikina, Pasig, and Batangas, and was also assigned to oversee Manila Cathedral on December 3, 1864.\n GOMBURZA incurred the hatred of Spanish authorities for fighting for equal rights among priest and leading the campaign against the Spanish friars. They fought on the issues about secularization in the Philippines\u00a0 that lead to the conflict of religious and church seculars.\n Their execution had a profound effect on many late 19th-century Filipinos; Jos\u00e9 Rizal, later to become the country's national hero, would dedicate his novel El filibusterismo to their memory. Mutiny by workers in the Cavite Naval Yard was the pretext needed by the authorities to redress a perceived humiliation from the principal objective, Jos\u00e9 Burgos, who threatened the established order.[clarification needed]\n During the Spanish colonial period, four social class distinctions were observed in the islands: Spaniards who were born in Spain,  peninsulares; Spaniards born in the colonies of Spain (Latin America or the Philippines), insulares or Creoles; Spanish mestizos, Chinese or 'Indios' (natives) dwelling within or near the city (or town) and the church; and Chinese or Sangley and rural Indios.\n Burgos was a Doctor of Philosophy[citation needed] whose prominence extended even to Spain, such that when the new Governor and Captain-General Carlos Mar\u00eda de la Torre arrived from Spain to assume his duties, he invited Burgos to sit beside him in his carriage during the inaugural procession, a place traditionally reserved for the archbishop and who was a peninsular Spaniard. The arrival of the liberal de la Torre was opposed by the ruling minority of friars, regular priests who belonged to an order (Dominicans, Augustinians, Recollects, and Franciscans) and their aliens in civil government but supported by the secular priests, most of whom were mestizos and darnas assigned to parishes and farflung communities and believed that the reforms and the equality that they wanted with peninsular Spaniards were finally coming. In less than two years, de la Torre was replaced by Rafael de Izquierdo.[citation needed]",

He traveled extensively in Spain, Latin America, and the United States, raising awareness and support for the cause of Cuban independence. His unification of the Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 community, particularly in Florida, was crucial to the success of the Cuban War of Independence against Spain.

He is also regarded as Cuba's \"martyr\" and \"patron saint.\"",
