  "/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)": "The centre (or center in the United States) in ice hockey is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play is the middle of the ice, away from the sideboards. Centres have more flexibility in their positioning and are expected to cover more ice surface than any other player. Centres are ideally stronger, faster skaters who can back-check quickly from deep in the opposing zone. Generally, centres are expected to be gifted passers more than goal scorers, although there are exceptions. They are also expected to have exceptional ice vision, intelligence, and creativity. They also generally are the most defensively oriented forwards on the ice. Centres usually play as part of a line of players that are substituted frequently to keep fresh and keep the game moving.",

  "/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)": "Winger, in the game of ice hockey, is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area.

Nowadays, there are different types of wingers in the game - out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents, and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. They tend to be bigger than centreman and smaller than defenseman. This position is commonly referred to by the side of the rink that the winger normally takes, i.e. left wing or right wing.",
