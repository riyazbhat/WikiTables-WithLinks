The Hornets name was left available after the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the New Orleans Pelicans. As part of a deal between the Bobcats, Pelicans and NBA, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the original Hornets' history and records from 1988 to 2002, while all of the Hornets' history and records from after relocation to New Orleans in 2002 through 2013 remained with the Pelicans. As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001-02 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004.",

This year marked the return of playoff success for the Boston Celtics, who had last made the playoffs in 1995, won their last playoff series in 1992 and made their last Eastern Conference Finals appearance in 1988. Though they eventually lost to the Nets 4-2 (preventing a Celtics-Lakers NBA Finals), they did create the biggest 4th quarter playoff comeback in Game 3, winning 94-90 after trailing by as much as 21 prior to the fourth quarter. (This record was later broken by the Los Angeles Clippers, who came back from 24 in the fourth quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies in 2012). The Detroit Pistons won their first playoff series since 1991. They would lose in the Eastern Conference Semifinals to the Celtics in five games.

In the early years of the NBA the team reached the NBA Finals twice in consecutive years before falling to the Lakers and then to the St. Louis Hawks. Following an extended era of mediocrity the Pistons, led by the Hall of Fame backcourt of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and nicknamed the Bad Boys for their intimidating defence, posted winning records every seasons from 1983-84 to 1991-92, and after narrowly losing in 1988, ended the Lakers dynasty of the 1980s the following season and repeated the following year. The Pistons third period of success, with former on-court star Dumars serving as general manager and building a top team from other franchises discards, occurred between 2001-02 and 2007-08 when the team won fifty games or more during every season, including a third NBA title in 2003-04 and a franchise record total of wins two seasons later. The Pistons have experienced two major periods of failure. Between 1956-57 and 1982-83, the Pistons had just three winning seasons and overall had a winning percentage of .417, culminating in a combined record of 37-127 (win percent .226) in the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons, after which the drafting of Isiah Thomas completely revitalized the franchise.

Also notable was the debut of the Chris Paul-led Hornets in the playoffs after Hurricane Katrina and their 7-game series against defending champions San Antonio Spurs, and the Lakers and Celtics' revitalization of their franchises, most especially after key trades during the preseason and regular season. The Celtics ended up playing 26 playoff games (2 games short of a full length postseason of 28), breaking the 25 game record of the 1994 Knicks and 2005 Pistons by 1 game for the most playoff games in a single season played by 1 NBA team.
