  "/wiki/Lake": "A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.\n Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.\n Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic, recreational purposes, or other activities.",
  "/wiki/Topographic_elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface (see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum).\nThe term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface.\n Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth. Due to the equatorial bulge, the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have, respectively, the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance.",
  "/wiki/Length": "Length is a measure for distance. In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement, the unit of length is a base unit, from which other units are derived. Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of an object.\n Types of length include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width or breadth, which are the side-to-side length, measuring across the object at right angles to the height.\n Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).",

  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols.[note 1] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position; alternatively, a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector.\nA common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and elevation.\nTo specify a location on a plane requires a map projection.",
  "/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)": "In hydrology, discharge is the volumetric flow rate of water that is transported through a given cross-sectional area. It includes any suspended solids (e.g. sediment), dissolved chemicals (e.g. CaCO3(aq)), or biologic material (e.g. diatoms) in addition to the water itself.\n Synonyms vary by discipline. For example, a fluvial hydrologist studying natural river systems may define discharge as streamflow, whereas an engineer operating a reservoir system might define discharge as outflow, which is contrasted with inflow.",
  "/wiki/Boardman_Lake_(Idaho)": "Boardman Lake is an alpine lake in Camas County, Idaho, United States, located in the Soldier Mountains in the Sawtooth National Forest.  While no trails lead to the lake, it can be most easily accessed from trail 091.  The lake is north of Boardman Peak.",
  "/wiki/Boardman_Creek": "Boardman Creek is a stream in the Sawtooth National Forest in Camas County, Idaho in the United States. It is a tributary of the South Fork Boise River, which in turn is tributary to the Snake River and Columbia River.\n Boardman Creek originates in the Soldier Mountains, then flows north to the South Fork of the Boise River. At Boardman Creek's mouth a foot bridge crosses the South Fork of the Boise River from Sawtooth National Forest road 227.  Trail 091 follows the creek for much of its length while other trails and forest road 010 are found in the upper portions of the creek's watershed.\n Boardman Lake is a small alpine lake found in the uppermost reaches of the Boardman Creek watershed.  Boardman Creek drains the northern slopes of Smoky Dome, the highest peak in the Soldier Mountains, as well as Boardman Peak and the four Smoky Dome Lakes, Lower, Upper 1, Upper 2, and West Smoky Dome Lakes.",

Trails 054 and 091 follow Deadwood Creek for much of its length, although there is no bridge at the stream's mouth to cross the South Fork of the Boise River to reach forest road 227.\n Heart Lake is a small alpine lake found in the uppermost reaches of the Deadwood Creek watershed.  Deadwood Creek drains the northern slopes of Iron Mountain as well as Lower and Upper Deadwood Lakes.",

The mountains are located within Sawtooth National Forest north of Fairfield, Idaho.
