  "/wiki/Homer_Martin_Adkins": "Homer Martin Adkins (October 15, 1890 \u2013 February 26, 1964) was a pharmacist, businessman, and Democratic politician who served as the 32nd governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas. Adkins is remembered as a skilled retail politician and a strong states' rights proponent and social conservative who served as governor during a period when Arkansas departed from several national economic and societal trends. The Adkins administration fought federal influence in Arkansas during the post-New Deal era; successfully courting federal wartime production investment during World War II while battling the federal resettlement of Japanese-Americans in the state and Supreme Court civil rights decisions. The Adkins administration was in several ways a forerunner to years of segregationist governors in Arkansas and across the South, most famously Alabama Governor George Wallace. The former Ku Klux Klan member fought the post-World War II civil rights gains made by African-Americans and sought to organize a constitutional convention to restore the white primary after the Supreme Court's Smith vs. Allwright decision. Derided as Holy Homer by opponents, Adkins' strong brand of social conservativism earned formidable opposition from moderates and more progressive politicians like preceding governor-turned rival Carl E. Bailey, as well as the pro-gambling interests in the resort town Hot Springs. After leaving office, Adkins remained an influential voice in state politics, assisting later governors Sid McMath and Orval Faubus.",
