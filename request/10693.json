  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha (sometimes called cha-cha), is a dance of Cuban origin. It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance.\n In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated. When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound \"cha-cha-cha\". Thus, the new style came to be known as \"cha-cha-ch\u00e1\" and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step.\n The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (one, two, three, cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion. For example, one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern. These Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of Cha Cha and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s, especially those of African origin. Thus, the footwork of the Cha Cha was likely inspired by these Afro-Cuban dances.\n In 1953, Orquesta Am\u00e9rica released two of Jorrin's compositions, \"La Enga\u00f1adora\" and \"Silver Star\", on the Cuban record label Panart. These were the first cha-cha-ch\u00e1 compositions ever recorded. They immediately became hits in Havana, and other Cuban charanga orchestras quickly imitated this new style. Soon, there was a cha-cha-ch\u00e1 craze in Havana's dance halls, popularizing both the music and the associated dance. This craze soon spread to Mexico City, and by 1955 the music and dance of the cha cha cha had become popular in Latin America, the United States, and Western Europe, following in the footsteps of the mambo, which had been a worldwide craze a few years earlier.",
  "/wiki/Oye_Como_Va": "\"Oye Como Va\" is a song written by Latin jazz and mambo musician Tito Puente in 1962.  Mexican-American rock group Santana's rendition further popularized the song, which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 11 on the Billboard Easy Listening survey, and number 32 on the R&B chart.\n The title comes from the first words, which can be translated as \"Listen to how [it] goes\" or \"Hey, how is it going\".\n The song has the rhythm and tempo of cha-cha-cha. It has similarities with \"Chanchullo\" by Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez. Latin Beat Magazine wrote: \"Cachao's tumbaos for his 1937 composition of 'Rareza de Melit\u00f3n' (later changed to 'Chanchullo') inspired Tito Puente's signature tune 'Oye Como Va'.\" On the original recording of the song the voice of Santitos Colon, the Puente orchestra singer at the time, can be heard in the song along with those of Puente and other orchestra musicians. Cachao can be heard playing contrabass in some of Tito Puente's live versions of \"Oye Como Va\".\n The song has had many arrangements and remakes by a number of artists in various tempi, including two remixed releases which hit the UK chart. The first of the \u2018Tito Puente Jr & The Latin Rhythm\u2019 remixes was released on the 16th of March 1996 under Media records, scoring a top 40 hit at #36.
