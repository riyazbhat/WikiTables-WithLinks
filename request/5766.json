It was a response to the dramatically altered Irish political climate after the 1916 rebellion and proposed by David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in May 1917 to John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, announcing that 'Ireland should try her hand at hammering out an instrument of government for her own people'.",

It was the first meeting of the unicameral parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic. In the December 1918 election to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Irish republican party Sinn F\u00e9in won a landslide victory in Ireland. In line with their manifesto, its MPs refused to take their seats, and on 21 January 1919 they founded a separate parliament in Dublin called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (\"Assembly of Ireland\"). They declared Irish independence, ratifying the Proclamation of the Irish Republic that had been issued in the 1916 Easter Rising, and adopted a provisional constitution.",

It was adopted by the First D\u00e1il at its first meeting on 21 January 1919 and remained in operation until 6 December 1922. As adopted it consisted of five articles. Article 1 declared that the D\u00e1il had \"full powers to legislate\" and would consist of representatives elected in elections conducted by the British government. For the exercise of executive power it created a cabinet, answerable to the D\u00e1il, called the Ministry (Irish: Aireacht), headed by a prime minister called the \"Pr\u00edomh Aire\" (in practice also known as the President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann). The constitution was limited to an outline of the functions of the legislature and the executive; the D\u00e1il later established a system of D\u00e1il Courts, but there was no provision in the constitution on a judiciary. The final article of the constitution declared that it was intended to be a provisional document, in the sense that it was subject to amendment. As adopted the constitution came to only around 370 words. In comparison, the modern Constitution of Ireland has approximately 16,000 words. Overall, the structure of the document was as follows:",

As the fundamental document constituting a state, a constitution cannot normally be modified or amended by the state's normal legislative procedures[citation needed]; instead a constitutional convention or a constituent assembly, the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution, must be set up. A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose, which it carries out in a relatively short time, after which the assembly is dissolved.

The Forum was initially dismissed, by Unionists, Sinn F\u00e9in, and others, as a nationalist talking-shop. The Forum's report, published on 2 May 1984, listed three possible alternative structures: a unitary state, a federal/confederal state, and joint British/Irish authority. The British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, dismissed the three alternatives one by one at a press conference, each time saying, \"that is out\", in a response that became known as the \"out, out, out\" speech. However, Garret Fitzgerald, who described the Forum's report as \"an agenda not a blueprint\", valued it as establishing a nationalist consensus from which the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement could be framed.",
