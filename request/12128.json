The lists in this article examine this definition of a double, while derivative sections examine much less frequent, continental instances. The Double can also mean beating a team both home and away in the same league season, a feat often noted as doing the double over a particular opponent.\n The first club to achieve a double was Preston North End in 1889, winning the FA Cup and The Football League in the inaugural season of the league.\n The team that holds the record for the most doubles is Linfield of Northern Ireland, with a total of 24."
