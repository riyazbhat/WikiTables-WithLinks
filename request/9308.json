  "/wiki/Sand_dune": "Dunes are large masses of wind-blown sand, and are most common in deserted environments, such as the Sahara, and also near beaches. An area with dunes is called a dune system. In physical geography, a dune is a hill of loose sand built by aeolian processes (wind) or the flow of water. Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, formed by interaction with the flow of air or water. Dunes can be natural, but also man-made (artificial). Most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter \"slip face\" in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a slack.",
