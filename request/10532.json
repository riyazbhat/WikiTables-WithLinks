  "/wiki/Riley_RM": "The Riley RM Series is an executive car which was produced by Riley from 1945 to 1955. It was the last model developed independently by Riley prior to the 1952 merger of Riley's still new owner Nuffield, with Austin to form BMC. The RM series was originally produced in Coventry, but in 1949 production moved to the MG works at Abingdon. The RM models were marketed as the Riley 1\u00bd Litre and the Riley 2\u00bd Litre.\n There were three types of RM vehicles produced. All used Riley engines with four cylinders in-line, hemispherical combustion chambers and twin camshafts mounted high at the sides of the cylinder block. \n The RMA was a large saloon, and was replaced by the RME. Both used a 1.5\u00a0L (1496\u00a0cc) 12\u00a0hp (RAC Rating), developed before WWII. \n The RMB was a longer car: it was replaced by the RMF. Both cars used a larger engine, new in 1937, a 2.5\u00a0L 16\u00a0hp (RAC Rating) \"Big Four\".\n The RMC and RMD were limited-production cars, an open 2 or 3-seater Roadster and a 4-seater Drophead.",
  "/wiki/Triumph_Motor_Company": "The Triumph Motor Company was a British car and motor manufacturing company in the 19th and 20th centuries. The marque had its origins in 1885 when Siegfried Bettmann of Nuremberg formed S. Bettmann & Co. and started importing bicycles from Europe and selling them under his own trade name in London. The trade name became \"Triumph\" the following year, and in 1887 Bettmann was joined by a partner, Moritz Schulte, also from Germany. In 1889, the businessmen started producing their own bicycles in Coventry, England.\n The company was acquired by Leyland Motors in 1960, ultimately becoming part of the giant conglomerate British Leyland (BL) in 1968, where the Triumph brand was absorbed into BL's Specialist Division alongside former Leyland stablemates Rover and Jaguar.  Triumph-badged vehicles were produced by BL until 1984 when the Triumph marque was retired, where it remained dormant under the auspices of BL's successor company Rover Group.  The rights to the Triumph marque are currently owned by BMW, who purchased the Rover Group in 1994.",
  "/wiki/Jowett_Javelin": "The Jowett Javelin was an executive car which was produced from 1947 to 1953 by Jowett Cars Ltd of Idle, near Bradford in England. The model went through five variants coded PA to PE, each having a standard and \"de luxe\" option. The car was designed by Gerald Palmer during World War II and was intended to be a major leap forward from the relatively staid designs of pre-war Jowetts. Just over 23,000 units were produced.",

They were previewed by the UK press at the Paris Motor Show on 22 October 1947, who expressed immediate disappointment at the car's conservative appearance.

  "/wiki/Standard_Vanguard": "The Standard Vanguard is a car which was produced by the Standard Motor Company in Coventry, England, from 1947 to 1963.\n The car was announced in July 1947, was completely new, with no resemblance to the previous models, and, designed in 1945, it was Standard's first post-Second World War car and intended for export around the world. It was also the first model to carry the new Standard badge, which was a heavily stylised representation of the wings of a griffin.\n In the wake of the Second World War, many potential customers in the UK and in English-speaking export markets had recently experienced several years of military or naval service, and therefore a car name related to the British Navy carried a greater resonance than it would for later generations. The name of the Standard Vanguard recalled HMS Vanguard, the last of the British Navy's battleships, launched in 1944 amid much media attention; permission to use the name involved Standard in extensive negotiations with senior Royal Navy personnel.\n The styling of the car was intentionally modelled on American lines by Walter Belgrave. Early cars had deep doors that blended into the bottom of the sills.\n The Vanguard was first exhibited to the public at the Brussels Motor Show in February 1948. It began to come off the assembly lines in the middle of 1948 but all production was allotted to the export trade. An estate car and a utility pick up version were announced in September, and then a 12 cwt delivery van. Aprons were fitted over the Vanguard's rear wheels from September 1949.\n In 1950, the Vanguard and the Triumph Renown were the first cars to be fitted with a Laycock de Normanville overdrive. The Laycock overdrive operated on the second and third gears of the three-speed transmission, creating, in effect, a five-speed gearbox.\n In Scandinavia, Standard marketed the Standard Ten saloon as the \"Vanguard Junior\".",
  "/wiki/Hillman_Minx": "The Hillman Minx was a mid-sized family car that British car maker Hillman produced from 1931 to 1970. There were many versions of the Minx over that period, as well as badge-engineered variants sold by Humber, Singer, and Sunbeam.\n From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the Minx and its derivatives were the greatest-volume sellers of the \"Audax\" family of cars from Rootes, which also included the Singer Gazelle and Sunbeam Rapier. The final version of the Minx was the \"New Minx\" launched in 1967, which was part of the \"Arrow\" family and essentially a basic version of the Hillman Hunter. Generally, the Minx was available in four-door saloon and estate forms, with a 1496-cc engine.\n The Hillman Super Minx was a slightly larger model offered during the Audax era.\n Throughout the life of the Minx, there was usually an estate version\u2014and, from 1954 to 1965, a short-wheelbase estate, the Hillman Husky, and a van derivative known as the Commer Cob.\n The Minx model name was revived briefly \u2013 along with the \"Rapier\" name, as applied to the Sunbeam Rapier version of the Audax family \u2013 as a special edition late in the life of the Talbot Alpine / Talbot Solara cars, produced by Chrysler Europe after its takeover of the Rootes Group.",
