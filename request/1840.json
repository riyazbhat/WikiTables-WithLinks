From paleontological and archaeological evidence, the genus Australopithecus apparently evolved in eastern Africa around 4.2 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 1.9 million years ago (or 1.2 million years ago if the species sometimes separated as Paranthropus are included). While none of the groups normally directly assigned to this group survived, Australopithecus does not appear to be literally extinct (in the sense of having no living descendants) as the Homo genus probably emerged from late Australopithecus species such as Australopithecus garhi, Australopithecus africanus and/or Australopithecus sediba. During that time, a number of australopithecine species emerged, including the afore-mentioned 3 species, Australopithecus afarensis, Australopithecus anamensis, A. bahrelghazali, and A. deyiremeda (proposed). For some other hominid species of this time \u2013 A. robustus, A. boisei and A. aethiopicus \u2013 some debate exists whether they truly constitute members of the genus Australopithecus. If so, they would be considered 'robust australopiths', while the others would be 'gracile australopiths'. However, if these more robust species do constitute their own genus, they would be under the genus name Paranthropus, a genus described by Robert Broom when the first discovery was made in 1938, which makes these species P. robustus, P. boisei and P. aethiopicus. Occasional suggestions have been made (by Cele-Conde et al 2002 and 2007) that A. africanus should also be moved to Paranthropus.",

A. ramidus, unlike modern hominids, has adaptations for both walking on two legs (bipedality) and life in the trees (arboreality). However, it would not have been as efficient at bipedality as humans, nor arboreality as non-human great apes. Its discovery, along with Miocene apes, has reworked academic understanding of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor from appearing much like modern day chimps, orangutans, and gorillas to being a creature without a modern anatomical cognate.\n The facial anatomy suggests that A. ramidus males were less aggressive than those of modern chimps, which is correlated to increased parental care and monogamy in primates. It has also been suggested that it was among the earliest of human ancestors to use some proto-language, possibly capable of vocalizing at the same level as a human infant. A. ramidus appears to have inhabited woodland and bushland corridors between savannas, and was a generalized omnivore.",

Fossil evidence determines that Australopithecus anamensis is the earliest hominin species in the Turkana Basin, but likely co-existed with afarensis towards the end of its existence. A. Anamensis and A. Afarensis may be treated as a single grouping.

  "/wiki/Annum": "A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked. A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given calendar. The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars; see below. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days.

The tribe was originally introduced by John Edward Gray (1824), long before any details on the speciation of Pan and Homo were known. Gray's tribe Hominini by definition includes both Pan and Homo. This definition is still adhered to in the proposal by Mann and Weiss (1996), which divides Hominini into three subtribes, Panina (containing Pan), Hominina (\"homininans\", containing Homo \"humans\"), and Australopithecina (containing several extinct \"australopithecine\" genera).

  "/wiki/AL_200-1": "AL 200-1 (Afar Locality) is the fossilized upper palate and teeth of the species Australopithecus afarensis, estimated to be 3.0-3.2 million years old. Its characteristics are an ape-like arrangement of teeth including spatulate incisors and a gap between the canines and outside incisors.\n It was discovered in the Afar Depression in Ethiopia by Ato Alemayehu Asfaw on 17 October 1974. Donald Johanson and Maurice Taieb announced the discovery and published the initial description of the fossil in 1976 (the first detailed description was published by Johanson and Yves Coppens the same year).",
  "/wiki/Afar_Region": "The Afar Regional State (/\u02c8\u0251\u02d0f\u0251\u02d0r/; Afar: Qafar; Amharic: \u12a0\u134b\u122d \u12ad\u120d\u120d) is one of the nine regional states (kililoch) of Ethiopia, and is the homeland of the Afar people. Formerly known as Region 2, its new capital as of 2007 is the recently constructed city of Semera, which lies on the paved Awash\u2013Assab highway.\n The Afar Triangle, the northern part of which is the Danakil Depression, is part of the Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, and is located in the north of the region. It has the lowest point in Ethiopia and one of the lowest in Africa. The southern part of the region consists of the valley of the Awash River, which empties into a string of lakes along the Ethiopian-Djibouti border. Other notable landmarks include the Awash and Yangudi Rassa National Parks.",
  "/wiki/AL_129-1": "AL 129-1 is a fossilized knee joint of the species Australopithecus afarensis. It was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia by Donald Johanson in November 1973.\n It is estimated to be 3.4 million years old. Its characteristics include an elliptical Lateral condyle and an oblique femoral shaft like that found in humans, indicating bipedalism.",
  "/wiki/LD_350-1": "Ledi-Geraru is a paleoanthropological research area in Mille district, Afar Region,  northeastern Ethiopia, along the Ledi and Geraru rivers (two left tributaries of the  Awash,  south of the Mille river). It stretches for about 50 km,  located just to the northeast of the   Hadar paleoanthropological area.\n Early research was conducted in 1972\u20131974 The Ledi-Geraru Research Project was launched in 2002. \nThe site is known for its early stone tools, dated about 2.6 million years old. A hominin mandible was found in 2013, known as LD 350-1 and dated 2.8 million years old, which may qualify as a very early specimen of the genus Homo.",
  "/wiki/Homo": "Homo (from Latin  hom\u014d, meaning 'man') is the genus which emerged in the otherwise extinct genus Australopithecus that encompasses the extant species Homo sapiens (modern humans), plus several extinct species classified as either ancestral to or closely related to modern humans (depending on the species), most notably Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis. The genus is taken to emerge with the appearance of  Homo habilis, just over two million years ago. Genus Homo, together with the genus Paranthropus is probably sister to A. africanus in the genus Australopithecus, which itself had previously split from the lineage of Pan, the chimpanzees. Homo erectus appeared about two million years ago and, in several early migrations, it spread throughout Africa (where it is dubbed Homo ergaster) and Eurasia. It was likely the first human species to live in a hunter-gatherer society and to control fire. An adaptive and successful species, Homo erectus persisted for more than a million years, and gradually diverged into new species by around 500,000 years ago. Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans) emerged close to 300,000 to 200,000 years ago,  most likely in Africa, and Homo neanderthalensis emerged at around the same time in Europe and Western Asia. H. sapiens dispersed from Africa in several waves, from possibly as early as 250,000 years ago, and certainly by 130,000 years ago, the so-called Southern Dispersal beginning about 70-50,000 years ago leading to the lasting colonisation of Eurasia and Oceania by 50,000 years ago.",
  "/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils": "The following tables give an overview of notable finds of hominin fossils and remains relating to human evolution, beginning with the formation of the tribe Hominini (the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages) in the late Miocene, roughly 7 to 8 million years ago.\n As there are thousands of fossils, mostly fragmentary, often consisting of single bones or isolated teeth with complete skulls and skeletons rare, this overview is not complete, but does show some of the most important finds. The fossils are arranged by approximate age as determined by radiometric dating and/or incremental dating and the species name represents current consensus; if there is no clear scientific consensus the other possible classifications are indicated.\n Most of the early fossils shown are not considered direct ancestors to Homo sapiens but are closely related to direct ancestors and are therefore important to the study of the lineage. After 1.5 million years ago (extinction of Paranthropus), all fossils shown are human (genus Homo). After 11,500 years ago (11.5 ka, beginning of the Holocene), all fossils shown are Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans), illustrating recent divergence in the formation of modern human sub-populations."
