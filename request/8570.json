  "/wiki/Dark_match": "Professional wrestling has accrued a considerable amount of jargon throughout its existence. Much of it stems from the industry's origins in the days of carnivals and circuses. In the past, professional wrestlers used such terms in the presence of fans so as not to reveal the worked nature of the business. In recent years, widespread discussion on the Internet has popularized these terms. Many of the terms refer to the financial aspects of professional wrestling in addition to in-ring terms.",

Just about any singles or melee match type can be adapted to tag teams; for example, hardcore tag team matches are commonplace. Tag team ladder match and variations are also frequently used as a title feud blow-off match. Stipulations, such as \"I quit\" or \"loser leaves town\" may also be applied.\n The following are match variations that are specific to tag team wrestling.",
  "/wiki/Triple_Threat_match": "Many types of wrestling matches, sometimes called \"concept\" or \"gimmick matches\" in the jargon of the business, are performed in professional wrestling. Some of them occur relatively frequently while others are developed so as to advance an angle and such match types are used rarely. Because of professional wrestling's long history over decades, many things have been recycled (many match types often being variations of previous match types). These match types can be organized into several loose groups.",
  "/wiki/Greg_Matthews": "Gregory Richard John \"Mo\" Matthews (born 15 December 1959) is a former New South Wales and Australian cricket all rounder (off-spin bowler and left-handed batsman) who is now a television cricket commentator.\n When Australian cricket was in the doldrums in the mid-1980s \"his dashing batsmanship and growing ability as a spin bowler suddenly elevated Matthews to a position of a national hero\". He made centuries in times of crisis against New Zealand and India in 1985\u201386, took ten wickets in the Tied Test at Madras and batted well against England in 1986\u201387.\n Thereafter his career declined as the \"effervescent and unorthodox\" Matthews did not fit in with the rest of the Australian Test team. As Australia rose to dominance in the 1990s Matthews proved to be \"not good enough in either of the game's main departments to make a lasting impact as a Test all-rounder\" and despite a century against England in 1990\u201391 he played only irregularly and was finally dropped in 1993.

  "/wiki/Ladder_match": "A ladder match is a type of match in professional wrestling, most commonly one where an item (usually a title belt) is hung above the ring, and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item. The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match, as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent(s), as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks, and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder.  However, there were very few matches in which the hung item must be used in a special manner in order to win the match, such as striking the opponent with the item (see Bam Bam Bigelow Vs. Scott Hall taser match, where one must strike the opponent with the taser, regardless of who retrieved the taser first).\n Ladder matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually \"containing\" a contract for a future championship match) or championship belts hung above the ring.  Ladder matches and their variants (such as TLC matches and Full Metal Mayhem) are often used in feuds that involve a dispute over possession of an item (such as a stolen title belt or the \"paperwork\" for the contractual services of a manager).  Ladder matches are almost always fought under no disqualification rules.",
