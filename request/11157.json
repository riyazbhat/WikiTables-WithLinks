It is administered by the Intramuros Administration (IA) with the help of the Local Government of Manila. IA was created through the Presidential Decree No. 1616 signed on April 10, 1979. IA is tasked to rebuild, redevelop, administer and preserve the remaining pre-war buildings, structures and fortifications of Intramuros. Intramuros is also called the Walled City, and at the time of the Spanish Empire was synonymous with the City of Manila. Other towns and arrabales (suburbs) located beyond the walls are referred to as extramuros, Latin for outside the walls. It was the seat of government and political power when the Philippines was a component realm of the Spanish Empire. It was also the center of religion, education and economy. The standard way of life in Intramuros became the standard way of life throughout the Philippines. The Manila galleons, which sailed the Pacific for 250 years, carried goods to and from Intramuros (Manila) and Acapulco, Mexico. Construction of the defensive walls was started by the Spanish imperial government in the late 16th century to protect the city from foreign invasions.",

Manila, alongside Mexico City and Madrid are considered the world's original set of Global Cities due to Manila's commercial networks being the first to traverse the Pacific Ocean, thus connecting Asia with the Spanish Americas, marking the first time in world history when an uninterrupted chain of trade routes circled the planet. Manila is also the second most natural disaster-afflicted capital city in the world next to Tokyo, yet it is simultaneously among the most populous and fastest growing cities in Southeast Asia. The Spanish city of Manila was founded on June 24, 1571, by Spanish conquistador Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi. The date is regarded as the city's official founding date; however, a settlement has already existed dating back as far as 1258.

The Manila Galleons were also known in New Spain as La Nao de la China (The China Ship) on their return voyage from the Philippines because they carried mostly Chinese goods, shipped from Manila.

The first successful round trips were made by Urdaneta and by Alonso de Arellano that year. The route lasted until 1815 when the Mexican War of Independence broke out. The Manila galleons sailed the Pacific for 250 years, bringing to the Americas cargoes of luxury goods such as spices and porcelain, in exchange for silver. The route also created a cultural exchange that shaped the identities and culture of the countries involved.

It was founded in 1914 by Felix Y. Manalo. INC describes itself to be the one true church and the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus, and that all other Christian churches are apostates. INC doctrine cites that the official registration of the church with the government of the Philippines on July 27, 1914, by Felix Y. Manalo - upheld by its members to be the last messenger of God - was an act of divine providence and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy concerning the re-establishment of the original church of Christ in the Far East concurrent with the coming of the seventh seal marking the end of days. By the time of Manalo's death in 1963, INC had become a nationwide church with 1,250 local chapels and 35 large concrete cathedrals. His son, Era\u00f1o G. Manalo, became the next church leader and led a campaign to grow and internationalize the church until his death on August 31, 2009, whereupon his son, Eduardo V. Manalo, succeeded him as Executive Minister.
