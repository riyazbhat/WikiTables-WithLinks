  "/wiki/Arab_Union": "The Arab Union is a proposed concept of a political union of the Arab states. The term was first used when the British Empire promised the Arabs a united independent state in return for revolting against the Ottoman Empire, with whom Britain was at war. It never came to fruition following the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement. Despite this, many in the Arab world have since called for the creation of a pan-Arab state. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser made several unsuccessful attempts to unite Egypt with other Arab countries (including Iraq, North Yemen and Syria). Similar attempts were made by other Arab leaders, such as Hafez al-Assad, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Faisal I of Iraq, Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Gaafar Nimeiry and Anwar Sadat.\n In the 2004 Arab League summit in Cairo, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh proposed the creation of an Arab Union replacing the Arab League for a stronger political and geographical body, capable of dealing with world issues. However, the proposal failed to reach the League's agenda.",

The name in Tatar is alt\u0131 (\u0430\u043b\u0442\u044b) meaning six, since it was worth 6 half-dengas (six halves, Russ. \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a), equivalent to three kopek silver, then copper, a small value coin, or 180\u2013206 copper puls. \n From the 15th century, altyn had been in use in several Russian principalities as a Eurasian currency between Russian and Asian traders. They were minted from 1654 under Alexis I, under Peter I as silver coins from 1704 to 1718. Later they were revived under Nicholas I as copper coins with a value of three kopeks from 1839. While the name altyn eventually got lost, three-kopek-coins circulated in Russia until 1991.\n In the 2010s, the Eurasian Economic Commission drafted first proposals to revive the altyn once again by 2025 as a common currency of the Eurasian Economic Union, although western sanctions against Russia reportedly urged the block to expedite the process by 3-5 years.",

  "/wiki/Economic_and_monetary_union": "An economic and monetary union (MCU) is a type of trade bloc that features a combination of a common market, customs union, and monetary union. Established via a trade pact, an MCU constitutes the sixth of seven stages in the process of economic integration. An MCU agreement usually combines a customs union with a common market. A typical MCU establishes free trade and a common external tariff throughout its jurisdiction. It is also designed to protect freedom in the movement of goods, services, and people. This arrangement is distinct from a monetary union (e.g., the Latin Monetary Union), which does not usually involve a common market. As with the economic and monetary union established among the 28 member states of the European Union (EU), an MCU may affect different parts of its jurisdiction in different ways. Some areas are subject to separate customs regulations from other areas subject to the MCU."
