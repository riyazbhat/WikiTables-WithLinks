Moore noted that as Presley began to learn to move on stage and to work the audience with his physical performance, his guitar became more of a prop.\n Presley was not known to treat his instruments gently. The lack of a microphone on his guitar in his early years contributed to the development of his aggressive style in attempt to be heard, and his strumming style would frequently break strings during his performances. As his career progressed, he became even more aggressive toward his instruments, frequently tossing his guitar to Charlie Hodge, who sometimes failed to catch it. As well, the large belt buckles and jewelry Presley wore left their marks on most of his instruments."
