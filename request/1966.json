The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people, for many centuries. Columbus was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the 'New World' in 1492. Later, the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola, after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.",

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity, and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later Great Britain) conquered it, renaming it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants.

  "/wiki/Cruise_ship": "A cruise ship is generally a large passenger ship used for ocean voyages in which the voyage itself, the ship's amenities, and usually the different destinations (ports of call) along the way each form part of the passengers' experience. There are also smaller river cruise ships. Transportation from one port or another is usually not the main purpose of the voyage. Voyages that return passengers to their originating port are sometimes known as \"closed-loop\" cruises. On \"cruises to nowhere\" or \"nowhere voyages\", cruise ships make two- to three-night round trips without visiting any ports of call. In contrast, the few dedicated transport-oriented ocean liners that remain typically transport passengers from one point to another, rather than on round trips. Historically, shipping lines built liners for the transoceanic trade to a higher standard than that of a typical cruise ship, with higher freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open North Atlantic ocean. Some former ocean liners, such as Marco Polo, now operate as cruise ships, although their number is diminishing."
