  "/wiki/Breakfast": "Breakfast is the first meal of a day. The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night.

  "/wiki/Drumstick_(poultry)": "Poultry (/\u02c8po\u028altri/) are domesticated birds kept by humans for their eggs, their meat or their feathers. These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails, and turkeys).\n Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \"poultry\" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.\n The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food.\n Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises.\n Together with pig meat, poultry is one of the two most widely eaten types of meat globally, with over 70% of the meat supply in 2012 between them; poultry provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning.\n The word \"poultry\" comes from the West & English \"pultrie\", from Old French pouletrie, from pouletier, poultry dealer, from poulet, pullet. The word \"pullet\" itself comes from Middle English pulet, from Old French polet, both from Latin pullus, a young fowl, young animal or chicken. The word \"fowl\" is of Germanic origin (cf. Old English Fugol, German Vogel, Danish Fugl).",
  "/wiki/Okra": "Okra  (US: /\u02c8o\u028akr\u0259/, UK: /\u02c8\u0252kr\u0259/), Abelmoschus esculentus, known in many English-speaking countries as ladies' fingers or ochro, is a flowering plant in the mallow family. It is valued for its edible green seed pods. The geographical origin of okra is disputed, with supporters of West African, Ethiopian, and South Asian origins. The plant is cultivated in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions around the world.",
  "/wiki/Egg_plant": "Eggplant (USA, Australia, New Zealand, anglophone Canada), aubergine (UK, Ireland, France, Quebec) or brinjal (South Asia, South Africa) is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible fruit.\n Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Although often considered a vegetable, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to tomato and potato. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.\n It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species thorn or bitter apple, S. incanum, probably with two independent domestications: one in South Asia, and one in East Asia.",
  "/wiki/Green_beans": "Green beans are the unripe, young fruit and protective pods of various cultivars of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Immature or young pods of the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis), and hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus) are used in a similar way. Green beans are known by many common names, including French beans, string beans (for old varieties; modern varieties are stringless), snap beans, snaps, and the French name haricot vert. They are also known as Baguio beans in Philippine English, to distinguish them from yardlong beans.  Other locals in the vegetable farming regions of the Philippines refer these as \"habitchuelas\". It is commonly grown in the northern highlands of Benguet, Mountain Province and Nueva Viscaya, and other mid-elevation areas in the country like Bukidnon, Quezon and Laguna. \n They are distinguished from the many other varieties of beans in that green beans are harvested and consumed with their enclosing pods, before the bean seeds inside have fully matured. An analogous practice is the harvest and consumption of unripened pea pods, as is done with snow peas or sugar snap peas.\n Historically, green bean pods contained a \"string\", a hard, fibrous strand running the length of both sides of the pod. This string was removed before cooking.  Modern, commercially grown green bean varieties are \"stringless\" and lack strings, though heirloom varieties may retain this trait.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Burmese_dishes": "The following is a list of dishes found in Burmese cuisine. Burmese cuisine includes dishes from various regions of Burma (now officially known as Myanmar). The diversity of Myanmar's cuisine has also been contributed to by the myriad of local ethnic minorities. The Bamars are the most dominant group, but other groups including the Chin people also have distinct cuisines. Burmese cuisine is characterized by extensive use of fish products like fish sauce and ngapi (fermented seafood). Owing to the geographic location of Myanmar, Burmese cuisine has been influenced by Chinese cuisine, Indian cuisine and Thai cuisine."
