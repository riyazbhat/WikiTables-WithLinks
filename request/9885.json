The first phase (1923\u20131925) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a \"legally-organized executive dictatorship\". The second phase (1925\u20131929) was \"the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper\". The third phase (1929\u20131934) was with less activism. The fourth phase (1935\u20131940) was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy: Second Italo-Ethiopian War, which was launched from Eritrea and Somaliland; confrontations with the League of Nations, leading to sanctions; growing economic autarky; invasion of Albania; and the signing of the Pact of Steel.
