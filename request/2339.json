This aircraft, a parasol monoplane of mixed construction, first flew on July 8 1939 with Guiliano Ferrari at the controls.  A production batch of 50 was ordered, but this was quickly reduced to just 10 machines, all of which were delivered in 1940.",

Prototypes for aircraft that entered service under a different design number are ignored in favour of the service version. The date the aircraft entered service, or was first flown if the service date is unknown or it did not enter service follows the name, followed by the country of origin and major wartime users. Aircraft used for multiple roles are generally only listed under their primary role unless specialized versions were built for other roles in significant numbers. Aircraft used by neutral countries such as Spain, Switzerland and Sweden or countries which did no significant fighting such as most of those in South America (except Brazil), are not included."
