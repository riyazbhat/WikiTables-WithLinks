  "/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog:_Triple_Trouble": "Sonic the Hedgehog: Triple Trouble[a] is a platform game developed by Aspect and published by Sega for the Game Gear in 1994. It is the sequel to Sonic Chaos and features classic Sonic series gameplay. The player can choose to control either Sonic the Hedgehog or Tails as they venture to protect the powerful Chaos Emeralds from others. Sonic and Tails can use items strewn across the stages, and differences in their abilities make for different gameplay experiences when playing as each character.\n Critics commented that the game was enjoyable and had excellent graphics, but lacked in challenge and had little originality to help it stand out from previous Sonic games. In retrospect, critics consider it one of the best Sonic games on the 8-bit Game Gear, coming closer than the others to matching the quality of its 16-bit counterparts. Triple Trouble was rereleased on various Sonic game compilations, the Coleco Sonic handheld system, and the Nintendo 3DS. The game features the debut appearance of Nack the Weasel, who would reappear in later Sonic media.",

  "/wiki/Sonic_Blast": "Sonic Blast[a] is a 1996 side-scrolling platform video game known for its use of pre-rendered visuals. To stop Doctor Robotnik from using Chaos Emerald shards to fortify his base, the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna through 15 levels. As a Sonic the Hedgehog series platformer, the characters run and jump to reach the end of a level while defeating enemy robots and collecting rings. In separate bonus stages, the player must run forward and collect rings to earn one of the Chaos Emerald shards. The game was developed by Aspect Co. and published by Sega for the Game Gear. It was the final Sonic the Hedgehog game for the system, and has been rereleased on the Master System (1997), through two Sonic-themed compilations (2003 and 2004), and the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console (2012).

The game features Sonic the Hedgehog exploring maze-like stages from an isometric perspective. Dr. Robotnik has robbed Sonic of his trademark speed, so Sonic walks slowly but can roll into a ball and dash across the stages. Critics thought the game was a unique addition to the Sonic library but flawed by convoluted controls and repetitive gameplay. It has received harsher criticism in retrospect and is considered one of the worst Sonic games ever. Sonic Labyrinth was rereleased on Sonic Adventure DX and on Sonic Mega Collection Plus, as well as the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.",
