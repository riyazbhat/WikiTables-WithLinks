  "/wiki/She_Bangs": "\"She Bangs\" is an up-tempo, salsa-influenced song made famous by Ricky Martin via his 2000 album Sound Loaded. The lyrics, loaded with metaphor and double entendres, express the singer's fascination with a woman who may be Lady Luck herself. The song was co-written by Desmond Child and Draco Rosa and produced by Rosa and co-writer Walter Afanasieff. Desmond Child co-wrote Martin's number one hit \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" as well as several hits for Bon Jovi and other rock artists in the 1980s and '90s. Draco Rosa was Martin's former Menudo bandmate. Walter Afanasieff had won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year the previous year as producer of Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\". The success of \"She Bangs\" reaffirmed Martin as a formidable crossover artist. Sound Loaded was the follow-up to Martin's 1999 crossover breakthrough album Ricky Martin and \"She Bangs\" was released to radio in advance of the album as its first single.",
