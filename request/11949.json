  "/wiki/Earl_of_Arundel": "Earl of Arundel is a title of nobility in England, and the oldest extant in the English peerage. It is currently held by the Duke of Norfolk, and is used (along with the Earldom of Surrey) by his heir apparent as a courtesy title. The earldom was created in 1138 or 1139 for the Norman baron William d'Aubigny. Its origin was the earlier grant by Henry I to his second wife Adeliza of the forfeited \"honour\" of Arundel, which included the castle and a large portion of Sussex. After his death she married William, who thus became master of the lands, and who from about the year 1141 is variously styled earl of Sussex, of Chichester, or of Arundel. His first known appearance as earl is at Christmas 1141. Until the mid-13th century, the earls were also frequently known as Earl of Sussex, until this title fell into disuse. At about the same time, the earldom fell to the originally Breton FitzAlan Family, a younger branch of which went on to become the Stuart Family, which later ruled Scotland and England.",
