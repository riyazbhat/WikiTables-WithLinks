  "/wiki/Prefix": "A prefix is an affix which is placed before the stem of a word. Adding it to the beginning of one word changes it into another word. For example, when the prefix un- is added to the word happy, it creates the word unhappy. Particularly in the study of languages, a prefix is also called a preformative, because it alters the form of the words to which it is affixed.",
  "/wiki/Boreoeutheria": "Boreoeutheria (synonymous with Boreotheria) (from Greek \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2, Boreas \"the greek god of north wind\", \u03b5\u1f50-, eu- \"good, right\" and \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, th\u0113r\u00edon \"beast\" hence \"northern true beasts\") is a clade (magnorder) of placental mammals which is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria (most hoofed mammals, most pawed carnivores, and several other groups) and Euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses, as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data.[citation needed] Placental mammals outside of this clade are the clades Xenarthra (sloths and their close relatives) and Afrotheria (elephants and their close relatives).",
  "/wiki/Euarchontoglires": "Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates.",
  "/wiki/Parareptilia": "Parareptilia (\"at the side of reptiles\") is a subclass or clade of reptiles which is variously defined as an extinct group of primitive anapsids, or a more cladistically correct alternative to Anapsida. Whether the term is valid depends on the phylogenetic position of turtles, whose relationships to other reptilian groups are still uncertain.",
  "/wiki/Euarchonta": "The Euarchonta are a proposed grandorder of mammals containing four orders: the Scandentia or treeshrews, the Dermoptera or colugos, the extinct Plesiadapiformes, and the Primates.",
  "/wiki/Primatomorpha": "The Primatomorpha are a mirorder of mammals containing two extant orders:  the Dermoptera or colugos and the Primates (Plesiadapiformes, Strepsirrhini, Haplorhini).",
  "/wiki/Primates": "A primate (/\u02c8pra\u026ame\u026at/ (listen) PRY-mayt) (from Latin primat-, from primus: \"prime, first rank\") is a eutherian mammal constituting the taxonomic order Primates. Primates arose 85\u201355 million years ago first as plesiadapiformes from small terrestrial mammals (Primatomorpha), which adapted to living in the trees of tropical forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment, including large brains, visual acuity, color vision, altered shoulder girdle, and dextrous hands. Primates range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs 30\u00a0g (1\u00a0oz), to the eastern gorilla, weighing over 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb). There are 190\u2013448 species of living primates, depending on which classification is used. New primate species continue to be discovered: over 25 species were described in the first decade of the 2000s, and eleven since 2010.",
  "/wiki/Procolophonomorpha": "Procolophonomorpha is an order or clade containing most parareptiles. Many papers have applied various definitions to the name, though most of these definitions have since been considered synonymous with modern parareptile clades such as Ankyramorpha and Procolophonia. The current definition of Procolophonomorpha, as defined by Modesto, Scott, & Reisz (2009), is that of as a stem-based group containing Procolophon and all taxa more closely related to it than to Milleretta. It constitutes a diverse assemblage that includes a number of lizard-like forms, as well as more diverse types such as the pareiasaurs. Lee 1995, 1996, 1997 argues that turtles evolved from pareiasaurs, but this view is no longer considered likely. Rieppel and deBraga 1996 and deBraga and Rieppel, 1997 argue that turtles evolved from sauropterygians, and there is both molecular and fossil (Pappochelys) evidence for the origin of turtles among diapsid reptiles.",
  "/wiki/Haplorrhini": "Haplorhini (the haplorhines or the \"dry-nosed\" primates; the Greek name means \"simple-nosed\") is a suborder of primates containing the tarsiers and the simians (Simiiformes or anthropoids), as sister of the Strepsirrhini (\"moist-nosed\"). The name is sometimes spelled Haplorrhini. The simians include catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes including humans), and the  platyrrhines (New World monkeys).",
  "/wiki/Procolophonia": "The Procolophonia are a suborder of herbivorous reptiles that lived from the Middle Permian till the end of the Triassic period.  They were originally included as a suborder of the Cotylosauria (later renamed Captorhinida Carroll 1988)  but are now considered a clade of Parareptilia.  They are closely related to other generally lizard-like Permian reptiles such as the Millerettidae, Bolosauridae, Acleistorhinidae, and  Lanthanosuchidae, all of which are included under the Anapsida or \"Parareptiles\" (as opposed to the Eureptilia).",
  "/wiki/Simiiformes": "The simians or anthropoids or higher primates are an infraorder (Simiiformes) of primates containing the parvorders Platyrrhini and Catarrhini, which consists of the superfamilies Cercopithecoidea and Hominoidea (including the genus Homo).",
  "/wiki/Hallucicrania": "Ankyramorpha (\"anchor forms\") is an extinct clade of procolophonomorph parareptiles which lived between the early Cisuralian epoch (middle Sakmarian stage) to the latest Triassic period (latest Rhaetian stage) of Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.",
  "/wiki/Catarrhini": "The Catarrhini or catarrhine monkeys or Old World anthropoids are the sister group to the New World monkeys, the Platyrrhini. The Platyrrhini emerged within \"monkeys\" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World), likely by ocean. With respect to the ones that stayed behind, Geoffroy in 1812 grouped the apes (hominoidea) and the Cercopithecoidea together and established the name Catarrhini, \"Old World monkeys\", or \"singes de l'Ancien continent\" . Darwin in the late 19th century imagined correctly that apes were the sister to the Cercopithecoidea. There has been some resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys despite the scientific evidence,[citation needed] so \"Old World monkey\" may be taken to mean the Cercopithecoidea or the Catarrhini. That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. The apes are further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and humans. The Catarrhini are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines."
