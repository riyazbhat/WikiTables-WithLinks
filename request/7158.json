Consequently, its IUPAC systematic name is 2-aminopropanoic acid, and it is classified as a nonpolar, aliphatic \u03b1-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as \u2212NH3+) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as \u2212CO2\u2212).
