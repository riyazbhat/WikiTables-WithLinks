  "/wiki/Coiba_Island_howler": "The Coiba Island howler (Alouatta coibensis) is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Panama. Although the Coiba Island howler is generally recognized as a separate species, mitochondrial DNA testing is inconclusive as to whether it is actually a subspecies of the mantled howler.  The reason for treating it as a separate species is the dermal ridges of its hands and feet differ from those of the mantled howler.\nA. c. coibensis is smaller than other Central American howler monkeys and has duller pelage than the Azuero howler, Alouatta coibensis trabeata.",

  "/wiki/Mantled_howler": "The mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), or golden-mantled howling monkey, is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, from Central and South America. It is one of the monkey species most often seen and heard in the wild in Central America. It takes its \"mantled\" name from the long guard hairs on its sides.\n The mantled howler is one of the largest Central American monkeys, and males can weigh up to 9.8 kg (22 lb).  It is the only Central American monkey that eats large quantities of leaves; it has several adaptations to this folivorous diet. Since leaves are difficult to digest and provide less energy than most foods, the mantled howler spends the majority of each day resting and sleeping. The male mantled howler has an enlarged hyoid bone, a hollow bone near the vocal cords, which amplifies the calls made by the male, and is the reason for the name \"howler\". Howling allows the monkeys to locate each other without expending energy on moving or risking physical confrontation.\n The mantled howler lives in groups that can have over 40 members, although groups are usually smaller. Most mantled howlers of both sexes are evicted from the group they were born in upon reaching sexual maturity, resulting in most adult group members being unrelated. The most dominant male, the alpha male, gets preference for food and resting places, and mates with most of the receptive females. The mantled howler is important to the rainforest ecology as a seed disperser and germinator. Although it is affected by deforestation, it is able to adapt better than other species, due to its ability to feed on abundant leaves and its ability to live in a limited amount of space.",
  "/wiki/John_Edward_Gray": "John Edward Gray, FRS  (12 February 1800 \u2013 7 March 1875) was a British zoologist. He was the elder brother of zoologist George Robert Gray and son of the pharmacologist and botanist Samuel Frederick Gray (1766\u20131828). The standard author abbreviation J.E.Gray is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name. The same is used for a zoological name.\n Gray was keeper of zoology at the British Museum in London from 1840 until Christmas 1874, before the natural history holdings were split off to the Natural History Museum. He published several catalogues of the museum collections that included comprehensive discussions of animal groups and descriptions of new species. He improved the zoological collections to make them amongst the best in the world.",

  "/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt": "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (14 September 1769 \u2013 6 May 1859) was a Prussian polymath, geographer, naturalist, explorer, and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science. He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography. Humboldt's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring.\n Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas, exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view. His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years. Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise, Kosmos, in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture. This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity. He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change, in 1800 and again in 1831, based on observations generated during his travels.",

He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\". Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us (after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9).\n Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death.\n Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I know no greater man on earth.\" Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.\" Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: \"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist.\" Linnaeus has been called Princeps botanicorum (Prince of Botanists) and \"The Pliny of the North\". He is also considered as one of the founders of modern ecology.\n In botany and zoology, the abbreviation L. is used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for a species' name. In older publications, the abbreviation \"Linn.\" is found. Linnaeus's remains comprise the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, since the sole specimen that he is known to have examined was himself.[note 2]",

He was head of the Vertebrate Department of the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet (Swedish Natural History Museum) from 1904 to 1933.\n In 1891 he obtained his PhD from the University of Uppsala, spending the next twelve years as an inspector in the fisheries service. During this time-frame he made scientific trips to Florida (1892 \u2013 1893) and the Caspian Sea (1899). In 1904 he was appointed head of the department of vertebrates at the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm. In 1910 \u2013 1911 he participated in an expedition to East Africa. From 1925 to 1942 he served as prefect of the Kristineberg Marina Forskningsstation (Kristineberg Marine Zoological Station).\n In regard to his zoological research, his primary focus dealt with mammals, birds and fish, but he also made significant contributions in his studies of reptiles and amphibians. He was the binomial authority of numerous taxa, and has several species named after him, such as Onykia loennbergii (Japanese hooked squid). The Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger named a small, secretive, venomous, endemic New Guinea elapid snake Apisthocalamus loennbergii in his honour, although this species is now synonymised with Toxicocalamus loriae (Loria's forest snake). In his obituary in the ornithological journal, Ibis, it was written: \"that since the days of Linnaeus hardly anyone has known so much about so many branches of zoology as L\u00f6nnberg\".\n In 1904 he founded the influential journal of biology, Fauna och Flora. As a conservationist he worked hard for laws protecting waterfowl and reindeer. In 1922 he became an honorary member of the British Ornithologists' Union.",
