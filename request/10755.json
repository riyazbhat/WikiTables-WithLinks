  "/wiki/Coiba_Island_howler": "The Coiba Island howler (Alouatta coibensis) is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Panama. Although the Coiba Island howler is generally recognized as a separate species, mitochondrial DNA testing is inconclusive as to whether it is actually a subspecies of the mantled howler.  The reason for treating it as a separate species is the dermal ridges of its hands and feet differ from those of the mantled howler.",
