  "/wiki/NY_30A": "New York State Route 30A (NY 30A) is a 34.86-mile-long (56.10 km) state highway in the Capital District of New York in the United States. It serves as a westerly alternate route of NY 30 from near the Schoharie County village of Schoharie to the Fulton County hamlet of Riceville, 1 mile (1.6 km) south of the village of Mayfield. While NY 30 heads generally north-south between the two locations and passes through Amsterdam, NY 30A veers west to serve the villages of Fonda and Fultonville and the cities of Johnstown and Gloversville. Along the way, it connects to several major east-west highways, including U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Esperance and the New York State Thruway in Fultonville. All of NY 30A north of NY 7 in Central Bridge was originally designated as New York State Route 148 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, replacing NY 54 from Fonda to Mayfield. The piece of modern NY 30A south of NY 7 has been part of several routes, namely NY 30 from 1930 to the 1940s and NY 43 during the 1920s and from the 1940s to the 1950s.

The route runs along the south side of the Mohawk River for its entire length and parallels NY 5, which runs along the north side of the Mohawk River (hence the S in the route number of NY 5S). In some locations, NY 5S has been upgraded into a super two or an expressway, mostly in Utica and western Herkimer County. The route is part of New York State Bicycle Route 5 west of its junction with NY 103 in Schenectady County. When NY 5S was assigned in 1930, the route stretched from Oneida in the west to Schenectady in the east. It was later truncated on both ends to eliminate overlaps with other state routes and to accommodate the construction of other roadways, most notably Interstate 890 (I-890) in western Schenectady.",

  "/wiki/I-90_(NY)": "Interstate 90 (I-90) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Seattle, Washington, to Boston, Massachusetts. In the U.S. state of New York, I-90 extends 385.88 miles (621.01 km) from the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley to the Massachusetts state line at Canaan, and is the second-longest highway in the state after NY 17. Although most of the route is part of the tolled New York State Thruway, two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the Capital District, is not part of the Thruway system and links Albany and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered I-190 through I-990 in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former Erie Canal route, New York State Route 5 (NY 5), U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and the CSX railroad mainline that traverses the state. I-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the Berkshire Connector to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in Schodack, and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany-Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.",
  "/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway": "The New York State Thruway (officially the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and colloquially the Thruway) is a system of controlled-access highways spanning 569.83 miles (917.05 km) within the U.S. state of New York. It is operated by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), a New York State public-benefit corporation. The 496.00-mile (798.23 km) mainline is a toll road that extends from the New York City line at Yonkers to the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley by way of Albany, Syracuse, and Buffalo. According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Thruway is the fifth busiest toll road in the United States. A tolled highway connecting the major cities of New York was first proposed as early as the 1940s. The first section of the Thruway, between Utica and Rochester, opened on June 24, 1954. The remainder of the mainline and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and provinces were built in the 1950s. In 1957, much of the Thruway system was included as portions of Interstate 87 (I-87), I-90, and I-95. Other segments became part of I-190 and I-287 shortly afterward. Today, the system comprises six highways: the New York-Ripley mainline, the Berkshire Connector, the Garden State Parkway Connector, the New England Thruway (I-95), the Niagara Thruway (I-190), and the Cross-Westchester Expressway (I-287). The portion of I-84 in New York was maintained by the Thruway Authority from 1991 to 2010, but was never part of the Thruway system and is currently maintained by NYSDOT. The Thruway utilizes a combination of closed (ticket-based), and all-electronic (open road) tolling.",

It extends for just over 7 miles (11 km) from an intersection with NY 30A in the town of Glen to a junction with NY 30 in the town of Florida. The route is a two-lane highway known as Mill Point Road, named for a small hamlet situated near NY 161's midpoint. At Mill Point, the road crosses Schoharie Creek. NY 161 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has not been altered since."
