  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_(historical)": "The Conservative Party of Canada has gone by a variety of names over the years since Canadian Confederation. Initially known as the \"Liberal-Conservative Party\", it dropped \"Liberal\" from its name in 1873, although many of its candidates continued to use this name.\n As a result of World War I and the Conscription Crisis of 1917, the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the \"Unionist Party\", led by Robert Borden from 1917 to 1920, and then the \"National Liberal and Conservative Party\" until 1922. It then reverted to \"Liberal-Conservative Party\" until 1938, when it became simply the \"National Conservative Party\". It ran in the 1940 election as \"National Government\" even though it was in opposition.\n The party was almost always referred to as simply the \"Conservative Party\" or Tories.",

The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history,  holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century\u2014more than any other party in a developed country\u2014and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's \"natural governing party\".\n The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), occupying the centre-left to left.  Like their federal Conservative Party rivals, the party is often described as a \"big tent\", attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the \"radical centre\".\n The Liberals' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and reproductive choice.\n In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election, winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons.

  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada": "The Conservative Party of Canada (French: Parti conservateur du Canada), colloquially known as the Tories, is a federal political party in Canada. It was formed in 2003 from the multiple right-wing parties which had existed in Canada for over a century, historically grouped into two camps, \"Red Tories\" and \"Blue Tories\". The party sits at the centre-right to the right-wing of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Liberal Party of Canada positioned centre to centre-left. Like their federal Liberal rivals, the party is defined as a \"big tent\", welcoming a broad variety of members. The party's leader is Andrew Scheer, who serves as Leader of the Official Opposition until his announcement of resignation on 12 December 2019.\n From Confederation till 1942, the original Conservative Party of Canada participated in numerous governments. Before 1942, the predecessors to the Conservatives had multiple names, but by 1942, the main right-wing Canadian force became known as the Progressive Conservatives. In 1957, John Diefenbaker became the first Prime Minister from the Progressive Conservative Party, and remained in office until 1963.\n Another Progressive Conservative government was elected after the results of the 1979 federal election, with Joe Clark becoming Prime Minister. Clark served from 1979 to 1980, when he was defeated by the Liberal Party after the 1980 federal election. In 1984, the Progressive Conservatives won with Brian Mulroney becoming Prime Minister. Mulroney was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, and his government was marked by free trade agreements and economic liberalization. The party suffered a near complete loss after the 1993 federal election, thanks to a splintering of the right-wing; the Conservatives' other predecessor, the Reform Party, led by Preston Manning placed in third, leaving the Progressive Conservatives in fifth. A similar result occurred in 1997, and in 2000, when the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance.\n In 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged, forming the Conservative Party of Canada. The unified Conservative Party claims to generally favour lower taxes, small government, more transfer of federal government powers to the provinces modeled after the Meech Lake Accord and a tougher stand on \"law and order\" issues.\n Under its first Leader Stephen Harper, the party governed with two minority governments after the 2006 federal election and 2008. It then won a majority government in the 2011 federal election before being defeated in the 2015 federal election by a majority Liberal government.",

Following the creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999, the riding of Western Arctic was made coterminous with the new Northwest Territories.\n After 1999, Western Arctic was an anomaly in that, unlike Nunavut and Yukon, it did not share the name of the territory with which it was coterminous. This did not change with subsequent representation orders because the electoral boundaries revision process did not affect the territories and the territorial riding names were specified in law. In 2014, at the behest of Western Arctic MP Dennis Bevington, the riding name was changed to Northwest Territories by Bill C-37, which also changed the names of several other ridings scheduled to come into effect with the representation order for the next election. Unlike those names, the change to Northwest Territories came into effect immediately as it involved amending the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act itself.\n From 1887 to 1905, the only areas of the NWT with representation in Parliament were those areas that became part of present-day provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and western Manitoba).

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years' War against the Kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.\n From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the Second World War. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n Following World War I, the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size, although at the onset of World War II it was still the world's largest. During the Cold War, the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force, hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world's foremost blue-water navies. However, 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships.\n The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers, two amphibious transport docks, four ballistic missile submarines (which maintain the UK's nuclear deterrent), six nuclear fleet submarines, six guided missile destroyers, 13 frigates, 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels. As of December 2019, there are 75 commissioned ships (including submarines) in the Royal Navy, plus 13 ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA); there are also five Merchant Navy ships available to the RFA under a private finance initiative. The RFA replenishes Royal Navy warships at sea, and augments the Royal Navy's amphibious warfare capabilities through its three Bay-class landing ship vessels. It also works as a force multiplier for the Royal Navy, often doing patrols that frigates used to do. The total displacement of the Royal Navy is approximately 439,200 tonnes (815,200 tonnes including the Royal Fleet Auxiliary).\n The Royal Navy is part of Her Majesty's Naval Service, which also includes the Royal Marines. The professional head of the Naval Service is the First Sea Lord who is an admiral and member of the Defence Council of the United Kingdom. The Defence Council delegates management of the Naval Service to the Admiralty Board, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence.

In 1968, the RCAF was amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army, as part of the unification of the Canadian Forces.

  "/wiki/Joseph-Ald\u00e9ric_Ouimet": "Joseph-Aldric Ouimet, PC (baptised Aldric) (May 20, 1848 \u2013 May 12, 1916) was a Canadian parliamentarian.\n Ouimet was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in an 1873 by-election as Member of Parliament for Laval, Quebec. He was a Liberal-Conservative and supporter of the government of Sir John A. Macdonald.\n After being educated in a seminary, and a brief career as a journalist, Ouimet became a lawyer. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the age of 25. His advocacy of the rights of French-Canadians was challenged by the Conservative government's attitude to Louis Riel. Following the First Riel Rebellion, Ouimet argued for Riel to be pardoned, and, in 1875, voted against a Conservative motion to expel Riel from the seat in the House of Commons to which he had been elected.\n With the beginning of the Second Riel Rebellion in 1885, Minister of Militia Adolphe Caron asked Ouimet to raise a regiment from Montreal to join in the suppression of the uprising. Ouimet raised three hundred men, and led his regiment as its Lieutenant-Colonel. He was put under the command of Thomas Bland Strange who rejected Ouimet's proposal to negotiate safe passage for Riel.\n Strange sent Ouimet to Ottawa to secure supplies resulting in newspapers accusing him of desertion. He returned west and was placed in command of Fort Edmonton.\n Despite fighting against the rebels, Ouimet opposed the execution of Riel when he returned to Ottawa. Ouimet's pleas fell on deaf ears, and, despite his efforts, he was condemned by French-Canadians for having helped put down the rebellion.\n Ouimet voted in the House of Commons for a Liberal motion to censure the government for executing Riel.\n The execution of Riel seriously damaged the Conservative Party in Quebec, and was one of the key factors in the party's decline and eventual loss of power. In an attempt at conciliation, Prime Minister Macdonald nominated Ouimet for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada following the 1887 election.\n Because of the custom of alternating between English and French Speakers following each general election, Ouimet returned to the backbench following the 1891 election. Macdonald died in June 1891, and his longtime Quebec lieutenant, Sir Hector Langevin, was forced to resign from Cabinet due to a corruption scandal in August. In January 1892, Prime Minister Sir John Abbott made Ouimet the senior minister from Quebec, and appointed him to Langevin's old job as Minister of Public Works. Ouimet stayed in that position under the succession of Prime Ministers who attempted to keep the Conservative government together. He also served as Acting Minister of Agriculture and Acting Secretary of State for Canada under Sir Mackenzie Bowell. Bowell faced a caucus revolt over his handling of the Manitoba Schools Question and was forced to resign. The issue split the party as English Protestant Conservatives rejected Bowell's proposal to create a new Catholic School Board in Manitoba.\n With the fall of Bowell's cabinet, the opposition of Tory MPs to French Catholic rights in Manitoba further hurt the party's prospects among Catholic Quebecers. Perhaps sensing that the Conservative government was doomed and that his prospects of keeping his seat were dim as Quebecers turned against the Tories, Ouimet decided not to run in the 1896 election. He declined to serve in the short lived Cabinet of the Sir Charles Tupper, the final Tory Prime Minister prior to the election. He instead accepted a judicial appointment that he held until his death in 1916.\n He holds the current record for being acclaimed to parliament 5 times.\n Ouimet Canyon near Thunder Bay in northwestern Ontario is named for him.",
  "/wiki/Liberal-Conservative": "The Liberal-Conservative Party (French: le Parti lib\u00e9ral-conservateur) was the formal name of the Conservative Party of Canada until 1873, and again from 1922 to 1938, although some Conservative candidates continued to run under the label as late as the 1911 election and others ran as simple Conservatives before 1873. In many of Canada's early elections, there were both \"Liberal-Conservative\" and \"Conservative\" candidates; however, these were simply different labels used by candidates of the same party. Both were part of Sir John A. Macdonald's government and official Conservative and Liberal-Conservative candidates would not, generally,[clarification needed] run against each other. It was also common for a candidate to run on one label in one election and the other in a subsequent election.\n The roots of the name are in the coalition of 1853 in which moderate Reformers and Conservatives from Canada West joined with bleus from Canada East under the dual premiership of Sir Allan MacNab and A.-N. Morin.  The new ministry committed to secularizing Clergy reserves in Canada West and abolishing seigneurial tenure in Canada East.  Over time, the Liberal-Conservatives evolved into the Conservative party and their opponents, the Clear Grits and the Parti rouge evolved into the Liberal Party of Canada.  On October 12, 1916, the last Liberal-Conservative cabinet minister, Sam Hughes, was dismissed, making the executive all officially Conservative Party members.\n Prominent Liberal-Conservative Members of Parliament and Senators in Canadian history include:",
