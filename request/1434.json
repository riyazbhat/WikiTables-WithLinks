Their football team compete in the Iraqi Premier League, the top-flight of Iraqi football. Al-Zawraa are considered to be one of the biggest clubs in Iraq having won 14 league titles, more than any other Iraqi team, and having never been relegated.

They have won the league unbeaten on a record four occasions and also hold the joint-record for the most Iraqi Elite Cups (with three) and the record for the most Iraqi Super Cups (with four). They are one of only two teams to have won all four of the aforementioned trophies in the same season (the 1999\u20132000 season), and they hold the joint-record for most consecutive league matches undefeated in Iraq (39 matches, from 1993 to 1994). However, Al-Zawraa have not been able to replicate their domestic dominance on the continental stage and have not achieved any major continental honours.
