Although they compete in a number of different sports, Cruzeiro is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Campeonato Mineiro,[nb 1] the state of Minas Gerais's premier state league, as well as in the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B,[nb 2] the second tier of the Brazilian football league system. The club was founded on January 2, 1921 by sportsmen from the Italian colony of Belo Horizonte, some members of Yale Atl\u00e9tico Clube and many Italian immigrant workers decided to create a new club called Societ\u00e1 Sportiva Ypiranga, changing the name months later to Palestra Mineiro and after one game to Palestra It\u00e1lia. As a result of the Second World War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any symbols referring to the Axis powers in 1942. The club board members rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the Cruzeiro do Sul's constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the Mineir\u00e3o stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators. Cruzeiro's regular kit colours are blue shirts and white shorts with blue socks (although the team has worn white socks with their home kit for certain periods of time). Umbro are the side's current kit manufacturers. Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs despite its relatively young age (compared with other major Brazilian clubs). It won the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A for the first time in 1966, after defeating Santos' Os Sant\u00e1sticos in the final series. Cruzeiro has won the Brasileir\u00e3o again in 2003, 2013 and 2014, obtaining the best campaign in the present format of the competition.",

It plays in the Paulist\u00e3o, the State of S\u00e3o Paulo's premier state league, as well as the Brasileir\u00e3o, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system. The club was founded in 1912 by the initiative of three sports enthusiasts from Santos by Raimundo Marques, M\u00e1rio Ferraz de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza J\u00fanior as a response to the lack of representation the city had in football. Since then, Santos became one of Brazil's most successful clubs, becoming a symbol of Jogo Bonito (English: the Beautiful Game) in football culture, hence the motto T\u00e9cnica e Disciplina (Technique and discipline). The most recognized Santista anthem is the Le\u00e3o do Mar written by Mangeri Neto. This was largely thanks to the Peixe's golden generation of the 1960s which contained players such as Gilmar, Mauro Ramos, Meng\u00e1lvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pel\u00e9, named the Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee, and widely regarded as the best and most accomplished footballer in the game's history. Os Sant\u00e1sticos, considered by some the best club team of all times, won a total of 24 titles during that decade including five consecutive Brasileir\u00f5es, a feat that remains unequaled today. Os Sant\u00e1sticos won four competitions in 1962, thus completing a quadruple, comprising the Paulist\u00e3o, the Brasileir\u00e3o, the Copa Libertadores and the European/South American Cup. Santos is one of the most successful clubs in the Brasileir\u00e3o, becoming national champions on eight occasions. It has also won 21 Paulist\u00e3os, three Copa Libertadores, two Intercontinental Cups, one Supercopa de Campeones Intercontinentales, one Copa CONMEBOL (the precursor of current Copa Sudamericana), one Copa do Brasil and one Recopa Sudamericana. On January 20, 1998, Santos became the first team, in any category in the world, to reach the milestone of 10,000 goals in the entire history of football and was voted by FIFA as one of the most successful clubs of the 20th century.
