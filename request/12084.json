Although they compete in a number of different sports, Cruzeiro is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Campeonato Mineiro,[nb 1] the state of Minas Gerais's premier state league, as well as in the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B,[nb 2] the second tier of the Brazilian football league system.\n The club was founded on January 2, 1921 by sportsmen from the Italian colony of Belo Horizonte, some members of Yale Atl\u00e9tico Clube and many Italian immigrant workers decided to create a new club called Societ\u00e1 Sportiva Ypiranga, changing the name months later to Palestra Mineiro and after one game to Palestra It\u00e1lia. As a result of the Second World War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any symbols referring to the Axis powers in 1942. The club board members rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the Cruzeiro do Sul's constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the Mineir\u00e3o stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators. Cruzeiro's regular kit colours are blue shirts and white shorts with blue socks (although the team has worn white socks with their home kit for certain periods of time). Umbro are the side's current kit manufacturers.\n Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs despite its relatively young age (compared with other major Brazilian clubs). It won the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A for the first time in 1966, after defeating Santos' Os Sant\u00e1sticos in the final series. Cruzeiro has won the Brasileir\u00e3o again in 2003, 2013 and 2014, obtaining the best campaign in the present format of the competition. Cruzeiro has also won record six Copa do Brasil titles and the Campeonato Mineiro 37 times. Cruzeiro won the defunct state competitions Ta\u00e7a Minas Gerais five times, the Copa dos Campe\u00f5es Mineiros twice, Copa Sul Minas twice, the Torneio In\u00edcio 10 times and the Supercampeonato Mineiro once. A Raposa also obtained many international laurels such as two Copa Libertadores, two Supercopa Libertadores, one Recopa Sudamericana, one Copa de Oro and one Copa Master de Supercopa. Cruzeiro is the only Brazilian club to complete the Domestic Treble, a feat accomplished in 2003 after winning the Campeonato Mineiro, the 2003 Copa do Brasil and the 2003 Brasileir\u00e3o.\n Cruzeiro hold a long-standing rivalry against Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. It has contributed many key and famous players towards Brazil's FIFA World Cup squads such as Piazza, Tost\u00e3o, Nelinho, Ronaldo, Luis\u00e3o, Alex de Souza, Maicon, Cris, Jairzinho, Rivaldo, Ed\u00edlson among so many others.\n Cruzeiro was relegated to Brazilian serie B for the first time in history on 8 December 2019, after losing to Palmeiras with the score of 2\u20130 at home.",

Since then, Santos became one of Brazil's most successful clubs, becoming a symbol of Jogo Bonito (English: the Beautiful Game) in football culture, hence the motto \"T\u00e9cnica e Disciplina\" (Technique and discipline). The most recognized Santista anthem is the \"Le\u00e3o do Mar\" written by Mangeri Neto. This was largely thanks to the Peixe's golden generation of the 1960s which contained players such as Gilmar, Mauro Ramos, Meng\u00e1lvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pel\u00e9, named the \"Athlete of the Century\" by the International Olympic Committee, and widely regarded as the best and most accomplished footballer in the game's history.
