  "/wiki/R._Budd_Dwyer": "Robert Budd Dwyer (November 21, 1939 \u2013 January 22, 1987) was the 30th State Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate representing the state's 50th district. He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until his death by suicide during a press conference.\n In the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n On January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of Harrisburg where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a .357 Magnum revolver. Dwyer's suicide was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n Throughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, William Trickett Smith, maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial\u2014 in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer\u2014  was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe. Moreover, Smith stated in October 1984\u2014 the year before his own trial\u2014 that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted it.",

  "/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act": "The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.\n RICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (Pub.L. 91\u2013452, 84 Stat. 922, enacted October 15, 1970) and is codified at 18 U.S.C. ch. 96 as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961\u20131968. G. Robert Blakey, an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee, drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee's chairman, Senator John Little McClellan.  It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and signed into law by Richard M. Nixon. While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime, its later application has been more widespread.\n Beginning in 1972, 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct.",

  "/wiki/List_of_United_States_state_officials_convicted_of_federal_corruption_offenses": "This is a list of notable U.S. state officials convicted of only certain select federal public corruption offenses for conduct while in office. The list is organized by office. Acquitted officials are not listed (if an official was acquitted on some counts, and convicted on others, the counts of conviction are listed). Officials convicted of state crimes are not listed.\n For a more complete list see: List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes.\n The criminal statute(s) under which the conviction(s) were obtained are noted, as are the names of notable investigations or scandals, if applicable. If a defendant is convicted of a conspiracy to commit a corruption offense, the substantive offense is listed.\n Criminal convictions such as making false statements, perjury, obstruction of justice, electoral fraud, and campaign finance regulations, tax evasion, and money laundering even if related, are not included in this list.\n Certain details, including post-conviction relief, if applicable, are included in footnotes.
