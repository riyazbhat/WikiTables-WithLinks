Realizing it bore crests on its skull, he assigned the species to the new genus Dilophosaurus in 1970, as Dilophosaurus wetherilli. The genus name means \"two-crested lizard\", and the species name honors John Wetherill, a Navajo councilor. Further specimens have since been found, including an infant.
