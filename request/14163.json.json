  "/wiki/Anabaena": "Anabaena is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria that exist as plankton. They are known for nitrogen-fixing abilities, and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants, such as the mosquito fern. They are one of four genera of cyanobacteria that produce neurotoxins, which are harmful to local wildlife, as well as farm animals and pets. Production of these neurotoxins is assumed to be an input into its symbiotic relationships, protecting the plant from grazing pressure.",
  "/wiki/Nostocales": "The Nostocales are an order of cyanobacteria containing most of its species. It includes filamentous forms, both simple or branched, and both those occurring as single strands or multiple strands within a sheath. Some members show a decrease in width from the base, and some have heterocysts.",
  "/wiki/Anabaena_variabilis": "Anabaena variabilis is a species of filamentous cyanobacterium. This species of the genus Anabaena and the domain Eubacteria is capable of photosynthesis. This species is also known to be heterotrophic in that it may grow without light in the presence of fructose. It also can convert atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia via nitrogen fixation.",
  "/wiki/Cyanobacteria": "Cyanobacteria /sa\u026a\u02cc\u00e6no\u028ab\u00e6k\u02c8t\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum consisting of free-living bacteria and the endosymbiotic plastids, a sister group to Gloeomargarita, that are present in some eukaryotes. They commonly obtain their energy through oxygenic photosynthesis. The oxygen gas in the atmosphere of earth is produced by cyanobacteria of this phylum, either as free-living bacteria or as the endosymbiotic plastids. The name cyanobacteria comes from the color of the bacteria (Greek: \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0kyan\u00f3s, lit.\u00a0'blue'). Cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes, are also called \"blue-green algae\", though some modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes. Cyanobacteria appear to have originated in freshwater or a terrestrial environment.",

  "/wiki/Gloeobacter_violaceus": "Gloeobacter is a genus of cyanobacteria. It is the sister group to all other cyanobacteria. Gloeobacter is unique among cyanobacteria in not having thylakoids, which are characteristic for all other cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Instead, the light-harvesting complexes (also called phycobilisomes), that consist of different proteins, sit on the inside of the plasma membrane among the (cytoplasm). Subsequently, the proton gradient in Gloeobacter is created over the plasma membrane, where it forms over the thylakoid membrane in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.",

  "/wiki/Prochlorococcus_marinus": "Prochlorococcus is a genus of very small (0.6\u00a0\u00b5m) marine cyanobacteria with an unusual pigmentation (chlorophyll a2 and b2). These bacteria belong to the photosynthetic picoplankton and are probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Prochlorococcus microbes are among the major primary producers in the ocean, responsible for a large percentage of the photosynthetic production of oxygen. Analysis of the genome sequences of 12 Prochlorococcus strains show that 1,100 genes are common to all strains, and the average genome size is about 2,000 genes. In contrast, eukaryotic algae have over 10,000 genes.",
  "/wiki/Synechococcus": "Synechococcus (from the Greek synechos, in succession, and the Greek kokkos, granule) is a unicellular cyanobacterium that is very widespread in the marine environment. Its size varies from 0.8 to 1.5\u00a0\u00b5m. The photosynthetic coccoid cells are preferentially found in well\u2013lit surface waters where it can be very abundant (generally 1,000 to 200,000 cells per ml). Many freshwater species of Synechococcus have also been described.",
