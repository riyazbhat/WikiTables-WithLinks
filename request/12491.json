The property was bought by Jim Fowler's Wild Kingdom; thereafter the site was converted from a wildlife preserve into a theme park named Wild World gradually over the years.

  "/wiki/Six_Flags_AstroWorld": "Six Flags AstroWorld or AstroWorld was a seasonally operated theme park located in Houston, Texas. Owned and operated by Six Flags, it was located on approximately 57 acres (23 ha) of land, which was later expanded to over 75 acres (30 ha) between Kirby Drive and Fannin Avenue, directly south of Loop 610 in Houston. Part of the Six Flags Houston complex, the park also included Six Flags WaterWorld, a water park that was adjacent to the main park. The park opened on June 1, 1968, and was originally developed and constructed as part of the Astrodomain, the brainchild of local philanthropist and former Houston mayor Judge Roy Hofheinz, who intended it to complement The Astrodome. AstroWorld was sold to the  Six Flags Corporation by the Hofheinz family in 1975. Although it was the fourth theme park to be included in the Six Flags family, it was the first to be acquired by that company rather than built from the ground up. Initially, it was marketed as AstroWorld: A Member of the Six Flags Family so as to not confuse patrons with Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington. AstroWorld was permanently closed by Six Flags, Inc. after its final day of operations on October 30, 2005, the final night of Fright Fest 2005.",

  "/wiki/Pipeline_roller_coaster": "The Pipeline Coaster is a roller coaster model where the trains ride between the tracks as opposed to a traditional roller coaster where they ride above them. The concept was first developed by Japanese ride company TOGO, and was known as the Ultra Twister. They built six installations of the design, and five are still in operation. Arrow Dynamics created an alternate version of the concept, but it never made it past the prototype stage in development. Intamin also experimented with the pipeline concept and built and relocated one model, known as the Spiral Coaster, but it is no longer operating. Some of the drawbacks of the design include the need for large, uncomfortable over-the-shoulder restraints as well as the obstruction of the riders' view by the enclosed pipe structure."
