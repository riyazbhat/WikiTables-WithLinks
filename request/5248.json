  "/wiki/NY_104": "New York State Route 104 (NY 104) is a 182.41-mile-long (293.56 km) east\u2013west state highway in Upstate New York in the United States. It spans six counties and enters the vicinity of four cities\u2014Niagara Falls, Lockport, Rochester, and Oswego\u2014as it follows a routing largely parallel to the southern shoreline of Lake Ontario, along a ridge of the old shoreline of Glacial Lake Iroquois. The western terminus of NY 104 is an intersection with NY 384 in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, while its eastern terminus is a junction with NY 13 in the town of Williamstown, Oswego County. The portion of NY 104 between Rochester and the village of Webster east of the city is a limited-access highway known as the Keeler Street Expressway west of NY 590 and the Irondequoit\u2013Wayne County Expressway east of NY 590; from Williamson to Oswego, NY 104 is a super two highway.\n The majority of Ridge Road and modern NY 104 from the village of Red Creek to the town of Mexico were originally designated as part of Route 30, an unsigned legislative route, early in the 20th century. All of Ridge Road and its continuation through Oswego to the hamlet of Maple View gained a signed designation by 1926 and became part of U.S. Route 104 (US 104), a United States Numbered Highway extending from Niagara Falls to Maple View, c.\u20091935. US 104, which never connected to US 4, its implied parent route, was redesignated as NY 104 c.\u20091972. As part of the redesignation, NY 104 was extended east to NY 13 in Williamstown over what had been New York State Route 126.\n The 104 designation, whether it be US 104 or NY 104, has shifted from surface streets to expressways and super twos, particularly from Rochester east to Oswego. The first such realignment occurred in the 1940s in Wayne County and was completed by the realignment of NY 104 onto the Irondequoit\u2013Wayne County Expressway near Webster in the 1980s.",

  "/wiki/County_Route_11_(Monroe_County,_New_York)": "The Monroe County, New York, Department of Transportation maintains 663 miles (1,067 km) of roads as county routes. Unlike most counties in New York, Monroe County does not post reassurance markers along its county routes. In fact, the only field reference to a route's designation are reference markers posted at bridges and culverts along the highway, which carry the county route number on the second line. Routes that do not cross either type of structure at some point are completely unsigned. As a result, county routes in Monroe County are widely known by their road name and not by their number.\n Route numbers were initially assigned across the county from east to west, beginning at the Wayne County line and generally progressing westward to the Orleans County line. Subsequent routes (those above County Route 238 or CR 238) do not follow this pattern and are located in all areas of the county. As a general rule, east\u2013west routes have designations ending in an odd number while north\u2013south highways carry designations ending in an even number. Several county routes partially or wholly overlap with New York state touring routes, serving as internal designations for county-maintained segments of those routes.",
  "/wiki/NY_350": "New York State Route 350 (NY 350) is a north\u2013south state highway in western Wayne County, New York, in the United States. It extends for 11.40 miles (18.35 km) from an intersection with NY 31 and NY 31F in the village of Macedon to a junction with NY 104 in the town of Ontario. NY 350 serves as the eastern terminus for three routes: the aforementioned NY 31F, NY 286, and NY 441, all of which originate in the Rochester area. Aside from the village of Macedon at its south end and the hamlet of Ontario Center at its north terminus, NY 350 serves mostly rural areas dominated by farmland. NY 350 was assigned c.\u20091932 to the portion of its routing south of Cator Corners, the north junction with NY 31F. It was extended northward to its current terminus in the 1940s.",
  "/wiki/NY_286": "New York State Route 286 (NY 286) is an east\u2013west state highway in the vicinity of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It links Rochester to its eastern suburbs and to western Wayne County. The western terminus of the route is at exit 7 on NY 590 just inside the Rochester city limits. Its eastern terminus is at NY 350 in Walworth. NY 286 is named Browncroft Boulevard from NY 590 to its junction with Qualtrough and Clark roads in Penfield. This portion of the highway passes through predominantly residential areas. East of this intersection, the route is known as Atlantic Avenue and traverses more rural areas.\n The entirety of NY 286 east of Blossom Road was originally designated as part of NY 35 during the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 35 exited Rochester on Blossom Road and followed it east to modern NY 286. The remainder of Browncroft Boulevard was designated as New York State Route 35B, an alternate route of NY 35, in the mid-1930s. The NY 35 and NY 35B designations were eliminated in the early 1940s and replaced with NY 383 and New York State Route 383B, respectively. NY 383 was truncated to downtown Rochester in 1949, at which time its former routing from Rochester to Walworth became NY 286. NY 383B was renumbered accordingly to New York State Route 286A.\n In the 1960s, the portion of Browncroft Boulevard from the Sea Breeze Expressway to Blossom Road was upgraded into a divided highway. NY 286 was rerouted to follow the improved Browncroft Boulevard while NY 286A was shifted south onto NY 286's former alignment along Blossom Road. The NY 286A designation was removed in the early 1970s, but Blossom Road remains state-maintained as NY 941V, an unsigned reference route.",

  "/wiki/NY_441": "New York State Route 441 (NY 441) is an east\u2013west state highway in the eastern suburbs of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It extends for 12.55 miles (20.20 km) from an intersection with NY 96 in Brighton to a junction with NY 350 in Walworth. The route starts as a four-lane divided highway in Brighton and western Penfield, and gradually narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it heads away from the city of Rochester. NY 441 connects to Interstate 490 (I-490) in Brighton and intersects NY 250 in Penfield.\n NY 441 was originally routed on Penfield Road between Brighton and Penfield when it was assigned in 1949. It remained on Penfield Road through Penfield and into Wayne County to Marion, where the highway ended at NY 21. The entirety of this routing had previously been part of NY 33, which was truncated westward to downtown Rochester as part of NY 441's assignment. NY 441 was cut back to NY 350 in Walworth by 1970. The divided highway that now carries NY 441 through Brighton and western Penfield was constructed during the late 1960s and opened as a realignment of NY 441 by 1971.",
  "/wiki/NY_31": "New York State Route 31 (NY 31) is a state highway that extends for 208.74 miles (335.93 km) across western and central New York in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 104 in the city of Niagara Falls. Its eastern terminus is at a traffic circle with NY 26 in Vernon Center, a hamlet within the town of Vernon. Over its routing, NY 31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in Upstate New York: Buffalo\u2013Niagara Falls, Rochester, and Syracuse. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, NY 104 to the north and NY 5 to the south, as well as the Erie Canal, as it proceeds east.\n Much of NY 31 west of Jordan was originally designated as part of a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY 31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route 30 (modern NY 31, NY 429, and NY 104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to Lenox. At Lenox, NY 31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY 316 and NY 46 to NY 5 in Oneida. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue east to Utica via Verona. With the advent of U.S. Route 104 (US 104) c.\u20091935, NY 31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n NY 31 was truncated westward to NY 365 in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY 31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of New York State Route 234, a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY 234 was transferred from the state of New York to Oneida County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY 234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY 234 became an extension of NY 31.",
