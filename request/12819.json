Eventually, plans for a system of seven lines radiating out from Five Points, Atlanta were developed and dubbed the Georgia Rail Passenger Program. The program included one line running through Clayton County and terminating in Macon. By 2004, GDOT's effort had concentrated on two lines terminating in Lovejoy (a shortened Macon line) and Athens. At the time, the planned Lovejoy line was anticipated to open in 2006 and $106 million in federal funding was earmarked for the project. The Clayton County Board of Commissioners was supportive of the line, asking the state government to advance the plan. In 2008, after years of inaction from the state on the project, then-governor Sonny Perdue announced his support for the Lovejoy line.
