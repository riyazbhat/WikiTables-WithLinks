Places of great natural and historic interest are to be found within its boundaries, such as El Cerro del Duque, Daidin and the Montemayor Castle.\n During the late 1990s, the Junta de Andalucia constructed a dam on the site of an old marble quarry, and now for much of the year the once ever-flowing R\u00edo Guadalmina is a dried-up riverbed.",
  "/wiki/Andalusia": "Andalusia region (UK: /\u02cc\u00e6nd\u0259\u02c8lu\u02d0si\u0259, -zi\u0259/, US: /-\u0292(i)\u0259, -\u0283(i)\u0259/; Spanish: Andaluc\u00eda [andalu\u02c8\u03b8i.a]) is the southern autonomous community in Peninsular Spain. It is the most populous, and the second largest autonomous community in the country. The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognised as a \"historical nationality\". The territory is divided into eight provinces: Almer\u00eda, C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, Granada, Huelva, Ja\u00e9n, M\u00e1laga and Seville. Its capital is the city of Seville.\n Andalusia is located in the south of the Iberian peninsula, in southwestern Europe, immediately south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha; west of the autonomous community of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines. The small British overseas territory of Gibraltar shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian province of C\u00e1diz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.\n The main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the Sierra Morena and the Baetic System, consisting of the Subbaetic and Penibaetic Mountains, separated by the Intrabaetic Basin. In the north, the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile\u2013La Mancha on Spain's Meseta Central. To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the Baetic System, while Lower Andalusia is in the Baetic Depression of the valley of the Guadalquivir.\n The name \"Andalusia\" is derived from the Arabic word Al-Andalus (\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633). The toponym al-Andalus is first attested by inscriptions on coins minted in 716 by the new Muslim government of Iberia. These coins, called dinars, were inscribed in both Latin and Arabic. The etymology of the name \"al-Andalus\" has traditionally been derived from the name of the Vandals; however, a number of proposals since the 1980s have challenged this contention. Halm in 1989 derived the name from a Gothic term, *landahlauts,\nand in 2002, Bossong suggested its derivation from a pre-Roman substrate. The region's history and culture have been influenced by the native Iberians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Visigoths, Byzantines,\nJews, Romani, Arab Umayyads, and Muslim Moors. During the Islamic Golden Age, Cordoba surpassed Constantinople to be Europe's biggest city, and became the capital of the Al Andalus and a prominent center of education and learning in the world, producing numerous philosophers and scientists. The Castilian and other Christian North Iberian nationalities reconquered and settled the area in the latter phases of the Reconquista.\n Andalusia has historically been an agricultural region, compared to the rest of Spain and the rest of Europe. However, the growth of the community especially in the sectors of industry and services was above average in Spain and higher than many communities in the Eurozone. The region has a rich culture and a strong identity. Many cultural phenomena that are seen internationally as distinctively Spanish are largely or entirely Andalusian in origin. These include flamenco and, to a lesser extent, bullfighting and Hispano-Moorish architectural styles, both of which are also prevalent in some other regions of Spain.\n Andalusia's hinterland is the hottest area of Europe, with cities like C\u00f3rdoba and Seville averaging above 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in summer high temperatures. Late evening temperatures can sometimes stay around 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) until close to midnight and daytime highs of over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are common. Seville also has the highest average annual temperature in mainland Spain and mainland Europe (19.2 \u00b0C), closely followed by Almer\u00eda (19.1 \u00b0C).",

In the 10th and 11th centuries, it formed part of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, and grew wealthy on trade and the textile industry, especially silk. It suffered many sieges and fell under Christian domination in 1489. In 1522, Almer\u00eda was devastated by an earthquake and rebuilding and recovery did not really get underway until the 19th century. During the Spanish Civil War, the city was shelled by the German Navy, and fell to Franco in 1939.

With a population of 571,026 in 2018, it is the second-most populous city of Andalusia after Seville and the sixth most populous in Spain. It lies on the Costa del Sol (Coast of the Sun) of the Mediterranean, about 100 kilometres (62.14 miles) east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about 130 km (80.78 mi) north of Africa.\n M\u00e1laga's history spans about 2,800 years, making it one of the oldest cities in Europe and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. According to most scholars, it was founded about 770 BC by the Phoenicians as Malaka (Punic: \ud802\udd0c\ud802\udd0b\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd00, MLK\u02be). From the 6th century BC the city was under the hegemony of Ancient Carthage, and from 218 BC, it was ruled by the Roman Republic and then empire as Malaca (Latin). After the fall of the empire and the end of Visigothic rule, it was under Islamic rule as M\u0101laqah (Arabic: \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0629\u200e) for 800 years, but in 1487, the Crown of Castille gained control in the midst of the Granada War. The archaeological remains and monuments from the Phoenician, Roman, Arabic and Christian eras make the historic center of the city an \"open museum\", displaying its history of nearly 3,000 years.\n The painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso, Hebrew poet and Jewish philosopher Solomon Ibn Gabirol and the actor Antonio Banderas were born in M\u00e1laga. The magnum opus of Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona, \"Malague\u00f1a\", is named after the music of this region of Spain.\n The most important business sectors in M\u00e1laga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand.
