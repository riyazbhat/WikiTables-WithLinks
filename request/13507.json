As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful and dictatorial action.  He established the long-term political dominance and dynasty of the Long family.\n During Long's years in power, large expansions were made in infrastructure, education and health care. Long was notable among southern politicians for avoiding race baiting and white supremacy, and he sought to improve the conditions of impoverished blacks as well as impoverished whites. Under Long's leadership, hospitals and educational institutions were expanded, a system of charity hospitals was set up that provided health care for the poor, and massive highway construction and free bridges brought an end to rural isolation.\n A Democrat and an outspoken left-leaning populist, Long denounced the wealthy urban Baton Rouge and D.C. elites, oligarchs and the banks. Initially a supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt during his first 100 days in office, Long eventually came to believe that Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" policies were an insufficient compromise and did not do enough to alleviate the issues of the poor or tackle the Depression. As a result, he developed his own solution called the \"Share Our Wealth\" program, which would establish a net asset tax, the earnings of which would be redistributed so as to curb the poverty and homelessness epidemic nationwide during the Great Depression.\n Long's Share Our Wealth plan was established on February 23, 1934, with the motto \"Every Man a King.\" To stimulate the economy, Long advocated extensive federal spending on public works, schools and colleges, and old age pensions. Long argued that his plan would enable everyone to have at least a car, a radio, and a home worth $5,000.\n Long split with Roosevelt in June 1933 to plan his own presidential bid for 1936 in alliance with the influential Roman Catholic priest and rightwing populist radio commentator Father Charles Coughlin. Long however was assassinated in 1935, and his national movement soon faded, but his legacy continued in Louisiana through his wife, Senator Rose McConnell Long; his son, Senator Russell B. Long; and his brothers, Earl Kemp Long and George S. Long, as well as several other more distant relatives.  He remains a controversial figure in Louisiana history.",

Roosevelt in 1932, as only the second Democratic Senator from Iowa elected since 1858, Murphy's service was cut short by his accidental death in 1936, with over two years remaining in his only term.\n Louis Murphy was born to John and Anna Murphy in Dubuque, Iowa, on November 6, 1875. His father was the publisher of the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald.  Louis attended the public schools in Dubuque, including two years of high school, but his earnings were needed at home, so his formal education ended.  He began a career in journalism at age 15, by serving as a reporter for the Galena, Illinois, Gazette from 1890-1892.  Returning to Dubuque in 1892, he worked at the Dubuque Times-Journal as a reporter then as a city editor.  Upon his father's death in 1902, he became the editor of the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald, serving in that position until 1914.   He was appointed by the Woodrow Wilson Administration to serve as collector of internal revenue for Iowa from 1913 to 1920.  After the end of that administration, he worked as an income tax counselor from 1920 to 1931, when he retired from active pursuits.  \n In 1932, he ran as the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat then held by Smith W. Brookhart.  Henry Field seized the Republican nomination from Brookhart. In the general election, Murphy defeated Field by a wide margin, as part of the Democratic landslide that accompanied the election of Roosevelt and defeat of Herbert Hoover. A chief plank of Murphy's platform was the restoration, as an agricultural relief measure, of the legality of beer.  \n Murphy served from March 4, 1933, until his death in an automobile accident near Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, on July 16, 1936.  He and his wife, Ellen, were returning to Dubuque from a week's vacation in Hayward, Wis., with Fred W. Woodward, publisher of the Dubuque Telegraph Herald, and his wife, Elsie, according to the Telegraph Herald (July 16, 1936). Murphy's wife, one of three passengers injured in the crash, reported that the accident occurred when a tire done blown out while Murphy was driving at low speed, causing it to plunge off an embankment. He was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, in Key West, Iowa (a suburb of Dubuque).\n With Murphy's death, the Roosevelt Administration lost a reliable ally in the Senate.  Although Murphy was replaced by another Democrat, (Guy M. Gillette), Gillette was often at odds with the president, opposing his plan to expand the Supreme Court, and opposing, until late 1941, Roosevelt's support for Great Britain.\n At the time of the accident, Mr. and Mrs. Murphy were the parents of five children\u2014Mary, Elinor Ann, Imelda, Ellen and Charles.
