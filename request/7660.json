It was the 82nd annual Memorial Cup competition and determined the major junior ice hockey champion of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).  It featured the host team, the Halifax Mooseheads as well as the winners of the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and the Western Hockey League which were the Barrie Colts, Rimouski Oc\u00e9anic and the Kootenay Ice respectively. The 2000 Memorial Cup was the first ever to be played in Atlantic Canada. The Rimouski Oc\u00e9anic won their first Memorial Cup, beating the Barrie Colts in the final. The Colts in particular made the 2000 Memorial Cup a controversial one, due to the presence of numerous players on their team who were clients of the rogue sports agent David Frost, including future murder-for-hire suspect Mike Danton.",
