The show was shot in Paramount Studios and its opening was shot in Big Bear Lake, California. Reruns of the show aired on ABC Saturday morning from September 2, 1972, to September 8, 1973, and on Sunday mornings in some markets from September 16, 1973, to September 8, 1974.

  "/wiki/Peregrine_falcon": "The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also known as the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in North America, is a widespread bird of prey (raptor) in the family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. The Peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high-speed dive), making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom. According to a National Geographic TV program, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389\u00a0km/h (242\u00a0mph). As is typical of bird-eating raptors, peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males. According to one study, it has the fastest visual processing speed of any animal tested so far, and can register discrete changes up to 129 Hz or cycles per second. As an analogy, film is a series of still images projected onto a screen. Those still images need to be changing at roughly 25 frames per second before humans see them as fluid and no longer as individual, discrete pictures. The film would have to be refreshing at 129 frames per second before peregrine falcons stopped seeing flashing, still images and started seeing fluid motion.",
