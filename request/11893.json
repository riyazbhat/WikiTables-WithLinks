These lines and services were operated by the Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) and city-owned Independent Subway System (IND) before the 1940 city takeover of the BMT. B Division rolling stock is wider, longer, and heavier than those of the A Division, measuring 10 or 9.75 ft (3,048 or 2,972 mm)  by 60 or 75 ft (18.29 or 22.86 m).\n The B Division is broken down into two subdivisions, B1 (BMT) and B2 (IND), for chaining purposes.

  "/wiki/Independent_Subway_System": "The Independent Subway System (IND or ISS), formerly known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System (ICOS) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad, was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway. It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932.\n One of three rail networks that became part of the modern New York City subway, the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government, in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) companies. It was merged with these two networks in 1940.\n The original IND service lines are the modern subway's A, B, C, D, E, F, G and M services. In addition, the BMT's N, Q and R now run partly on IND trackage.  The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service. For operational purposes, the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division.",

The northern section of the line, between Jay Street\u2013MetroTech and Church Avenue, is a four-track line that was built by the IND in 1933, running primarily underground except for a short elevated section over the Gowanus Canal. The southern section, between Ditmas Avenue and Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue, was originally built by the BMT in 1919\u20131920 as a three-track elevated structure between Ninth Avenue in Sunset Park and Avenue X, and as a two-track elevated structure south of Avenue X.",

The Q train runs the length of the entire line from Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue to the Manhattan Bridge south tracks. The B begins at Brighton Beach and runs via the bridge's north tracks. The line first opened in 1878 as a two-track surface-level excursion railroad called the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway, transporting riders from Downtown Brooklyn via a connection with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to the seaside resorts at Coney Island. When its connection with the LIRR was severed in 1883, the line became the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad, which was eventually acquired by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation [BMT]). From 1903 to 1908, and again from 1918 to 1920, all of the line's grade crossings were eliminated; as part of the second project, much of the original line was widened to four tracks and a new subway alignment was built north of the Prospect Park station.
