She is the current three-time reigning Overall World Cup champion, the four-time reigning world champion in slalom, and a six-time winner of the World Cup discipline title in that event. Shiffrin is the youngest slalom champion in Olympic alpine skiing history, at 18 years and 345 days.\n By winning her second Olympic gold medal in the 2018 giant slalom, Shiffrin tied Ted Ligety and Andrea Mead Lawrence for the most Olympic gold medals ever won by an American Olympian in alpine skiing. She is one of only 5 Americans to ever win the World Cup overall title. She is also the first and only athlete\u2014male or female\u2014with wins in all six FIS Alpine Ski World Cup disciplines.

She is the only athlete - male or female - to have won 15 races in the same calendar year, winning the last slalom of the 2018 season in Semmering and surpassing Marcel Hirscher. In the 2019 season she became the first athlete, male or female, to win 17 World Cup races during a season, breaking the record of 14 wins that Vreni Schneider had held for 30 years.

The overall titles were won by Marcel Hirscher of Austria and Tina Maze of Slovenia.\n A break in the schedule was for the biennial World Championships, held 4\u201317 February in Schladming, Austria. Changes for the 2013 season included the awarding of World Cup points for the slalom crystal globe for the limited field city events (parallel slalom), not just in the overall standings. Also, a crystal globe trophy was no longer awarded for the combined event, as many organizers considered the event difficult to market, but its results still counted in the overall rankings.\n Maze became the first Slovenian to win an overall World Cup title; she clinched it on 24 February after her eighth victory of the season, a super-combined race at M\u00e9ribel, France. Her victory in a downhill race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany on 2 March gave her wins in all five disciplines for the season, and she became the first racer in World Cup history to score more than 2,000 points in a single season. The previous record of 2,000 points was held by Hermann Maier, set during the 2000 season.\n Maze broke various statistical records in this season, including the highest number of podiums in a season (24, record previously held by Maier (22) and by Hanni Wenzel and Pernilla Wiberg for ladies (18)), highest number of top 5 finishes (31, previously Maier and Wiberg (24)), highest number of points after first 10 races (677, previously Katja Seizinger, 643), largest percent of possible points won (69%, previously 61% by Wiberg), and the highest margin over the runner-up (1313, compared to 743 for Maier and 578 for Lindsey Vonn). Maze finished on podium in all giant slalom events, previously achieved only by Vreni Schneider in 1989. She is also the only woman to remain at the top of the overall standings throughout the season - a feat previously achieved only by Bode Miller in 2005. In addition to the overall title, Maze won the super-G and giant slalom titles, finished at the top of the combined list by winning both races in the season, and finished second in the downhill and slalom. Those titles went respectively to two Americans, Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin. Vonn's season ended with a knee injury on 5 February at the World Championships, but she held on to win the downhill title by a single point after the final race was cancelled. Three days after turning 18, Shiffrin won the final slalom race at Lenzerheide on 16 March to overtake Maze and win that discipline's season title by 33 points.\n The men's overall title wasn't decided until the World Cup finals at Lenzerheide. A runner-up finish in the giant slalom on 16 March gave Hirscher his second consecutive overall title, the first male to achieve this feat since Stephan Eberharter in 2002 and 2003. Hirscher also won the slalom title, while the downhill and super-G titles went to Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, the sixth and seventh discipline titles for the former two-time overall champion. The giant slalom title went to American Ted Ligety, who won six of the eight GS races for his fourth season title in that discipline.",

This was the first season in which the races began prior to January 1, and that change immediately became permanent.  Karl Schranz of Austria won the first of two consecutive overall titles. Gertrude Gabl of Austria won the women's overall title.  For the first and only (as of 2016) time in World Cup history, a discipline trophy was shared by more than two people, as four men (3 French, 1 Austrian) tied for the Men's Slalom trophy.\n The race footage for the film Downhill Racer was shot during this season, primarily in January 1969.",
  "/wiki/1980_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 14th World Cup season began in December 1979 in France and concluded in March 1980 in Austria.\n Andreas Wenzel of Liechtenstein edged out Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden for the men's overall title. Wenzel's older sister, Hanni Wenzel, won the women's overall title for the second time, making them the first sibling combination to both win the overall World Cup title (as of 2017, joined only by Janica and Ivica Kosteli\u0107 from Croatia) and the only one to win in the same year.\n The World Cup race scoring system was revised again, the third different system used in less than a year.  The new system was a \"Top 15\" points system (ranging from 25 points for first, 20 for second, 15 for third, 12 for fourth, and 1 point less for each subsequent position down to 1 point for 15th).  This system remained in effect through 1991.  The season championship for the \"Combined\" discipline also returned this year, for the first time since 1976.\n A break in the schedule in February was for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, U.S.A.

  "/wiki/1975_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 9th World Cup season began in December 1974 in France and concluded in March 1975 in Italy.  Gustav Th\u00f6ni of Italy would regain the overall title, his fourth overall title in five seasons. Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll of Austria won the women's overall title, her fifth consecutive.\n Three major changes took place on the World Cup circuit this season.  First, Alpine combined races were recognized as World Cup events for the first time; both the men's and women's seasons included three combined races, all of which were won by the overall winners (Th\u00f6ni and Moser-Pr\u00f6ll); in fact, Th\u00f6ni's three combined wins were directly responsible for his edging out Ingemar Stenmark for the title.  Second, a parallel slalom race was held at the end of the season, as parallel slalom had become popular on the professional skiing tour due to the visible head-to-head competition.  Although parallel slalom skiing was used a few more times in World Cup competition, beginning in 1976 it became a permanent part of the season-ending Nations Cup events.\n Third, and more importantly, the new head of the International Olympic Committee, Lord Killanin, reached a compromise to preserve the \"amateur\" status of skiers receiving endorsements, manufacturer's fees, and other payments, as long as the payments were made to the skier's national association or Olympic committee and not directly to the skier, that also eliminated the prohibition on year-round training and competition in a sport.  While further criticism of this rule, known as Olympics Rule 26, would continue and would lead to future problems, such as the banning of World Cup champions Stenmark and Hanni Wenzel from the 1984 Winter Olympics, the immediate impact of this change was to check the steady migration of World Cup skiers to the professional circuit.  Partially as a result, World Cup races this season took place in Europe, North America, and Asia.",
