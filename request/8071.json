Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) ranking[a] whilst on the international stage occupies the 5th position in Europe and the eleventh in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, having led the UEFA ranking during seven seasons since its inception in 1979, the most for an Italian team and joint second overall.\n Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league (reformulated as Serie A from 1929) since its debut in 1900 after changing its name to Foot-Ball Club Juventus, with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[b] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus the first professional sporting club ante litteram in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa italiana since 2001.\n Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.

Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (\"anti-parochialism\") and italianit\u00e0 (\"Italianness\").

This success was replicated in the league, which the club won five times in the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. In domestic football, the club has won 65 trophies; a record 33 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 11 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.

In 714 Moroccan and Arab Moors occupied the city, introducing their language, religion and customs; they implemented improved irrigation systems and the cultivation of new crops as well.  Valencia was the capital of the Taifa of Valencia. In 1238 the Christian king James I of Aragon conquered the city and divided the land among the nobles who helped him conquer it, as witnessed in the Llibre del Repartiment. He also created a new law for the city, the Furs of Valencia, which were extended to the rest of the Kingdom of Valencia. In the 18th century Philip V of Spain abolished the privileges as punishment to the kingdom of Valencia for aligning with the Habsburg side in the War of the Spanish Succession.

The investor-operators control their teams as owners control teams in other leagues, and are commonly (but inaccurately) referred to as the team's owners. The league has a fixed membership like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues that does not use promotion and relegation, a practice that is uncommon in the two countries.
