  "/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_(Canada)": "The New Democratic Party (NDP; French: Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique, NPD) is a social-democratic federal political party in Canada. The party was founded in 1961 out of the merger of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) with the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). On the Canadian political spectrum, the party sits to the left of the Liberal Party. Since 2017, the NDP has been led by Jagmeet Singh, who is the first Indo-Canadian to lead a major federal party in Canada. The federal and provincial (or territorial) level NDPs are more integrated than other political parties in Canada, and have shared membership (except for the New Democratic Party of Quebec). Often the third- or fourth-largest party in Canada's House of Commons, the NDP has never been in power at the federal level, but it has attained second-largest party status once. In the 2011 election under the leadership of Jack Layton, the NDP won the second most seats in the House, gaining the position of Official Opposition for the first time in the party's history. The NDP subsequently lost 59 seats in the 2015 federal election and fell to third place in Parliament, though it was their second-best seat count to date.",
  "/wiki/Acadie\u2014Bathurst": "Acadie\u2014Bathurst (formerly Gloucester) is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1867. Until 1997, the riding was largely held by the Liberal Party thanks to strong support from the francophone Acadian population. There is also a notable Red Tory tendency in the riding that enabled the former Progressive Conservative Party to win on occasion. In the 1997 federal election, the New Democratic Party's  Yvon Godin won an unexpected victory over powerful Liberal cabinet minister Doug Young, mostly due to his Union connections and EI recipients' reaction to Liberal cuts to Employment Insurance. Godin held the riding until his retirement as of the 2015 federal election, at which point the Liberals reclaimed the riding as part of their sweep of Atlantic Canada.",

  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada (French: Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada. The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history,  holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century\u2014more than any other party in a developed country\u2014and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's natural governing party. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), occupying the centre-left to left. Like their federal Conservative Party rivals, the party is often described as a big tent, attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre. The Liberals' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and reproductive choice. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election, winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons. However, in the 2019 federal election, they lost their majority, winning 157 seats, but they still remained the largest party in the House.",
