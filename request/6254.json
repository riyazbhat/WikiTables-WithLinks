  "/wiki/Sven_Kramer": "Sven Kramer (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8sv\u025bn\u02d0 \u02c8kra\u02d0m\u0259r]; born 23 April 1986) is a Dutch long track speed skater who has won an all-time record nine World Allround Championships as well as a record ten European Allround Championships. He is the Olympic champion of the 5000 meters at the Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 Olympics, and won a record 20 gold medals at the World Single Distance Championships; eight in the 5000 meters, five in the 10,000 meters, and seven in the team pursuit. Kramer is the current world record holder in the team pursuit (alongside Jan Blokhuijsen and Koen Verweij), and broke the world records in the 5000 meter and 10,000 meter events three times. By winning the 2010 World Allround Championship, Kramer became the first speed skater in history to win four consecutive world allround championships, and eight consecutive international allround championships. He was undefeated in the 18 international allround championships he participated in from the 2006/2007 season until the 2016/2017 season. From November 2007 to March 2009 he was ranked first in the Adelskalender, but despite his dominance as an all-round skater he has since been overtaken on that list by Shani Davis and, more recently, by his team mate Patrick Roest .",
