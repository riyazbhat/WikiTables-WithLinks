It is one of the constituent counties of Munster GAA. Cork is one of the few 'dual counties' in Ireland, competing in a similar level in both Gaelic football and hurling. As of the end of the 2015 National Leagues, Cork compete in the top division of both sports. However, despite both teams competing at the top level of the game for most of the county's history, the hurling team has experienced more success, winning the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 30 times. By comparison, Cork has only won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship seven times. Traditionally football is strongest in the western half of the county, with the O'Donovan Rossa club of Skibbereen the only Cork team from outside the city to have an All-Ireland Club Football title. Hurling is the dominant sport in the east, with teams such as Sarsfields and Midleton having won Cork's club championship multiple times. Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule of thumb, with hurling pockets in football areas and vice versa. One example is Fermoy in east Cork, which has seven Cork football titles to its name. The city of Cork traditionally has strong teams in both sports, with Nemo Rangers being the record-holders for All-Ireland Club Football Championships won, and Blackrock having three All-Ireland Club Hurling titles. As well as this, the St Finbarr's club in the city has eight Cork football titles and 25 in hurling.",
