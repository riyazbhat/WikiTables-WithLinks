  "/wiki/Adriatic_Sea": "The Adriatic Sea /\u02cce\u026adri\u02c8\u00e6t\u026ak/ is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres (4,045\u00a0ft). The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.",

At Rastoke the Slunj\u010dica leads into the river Korana, which reaches this point after passing the Plitvice Lakes National Park. The city of Slunj bears its name from this river.

It has been regulated by man to flow into an aqueduct in Gusi\u0107 polje (known as Tunel Gacka-Gusi\u0107 Jezero) and then into the Adriatic Sea through a hydroelectric installation HE Senj near Sveti Juraj. HE Senj takes inflow from Gacka and Lika, since it was built in 1965. The river passes through karst fields and most notably the town Oto\u010dac, and its headwaters are known as a popular locale for trout fishing.",
  "/wiki/Jadro": "The Jadro is a watercourse in Dalmatia, Croatia that discharges to the Adriatic Sea.  The upper reaches of the Jadro River, as well as its source, Jadro Spring,  are protected as an ichthyological nature reserve, partly due to the presence of an endemic species of soft-mouthed trout.  The headwaters of the Jadro River were the original water supply for the ancient city comprised by Diocletian's Palace (now an area within the present day city of Split). Contemporary studies indicate favourable water quality levels of the river near the headwaters at Jadro Spring.",
  "/wiki/Ombla": "The Ombla is a short river in Croatia, northeast of Dubrovnik. Its course is approximately 30 metres (98 feet) long, and it empties into the Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka embayment of the Adriatic Sea near Komolac in Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Rijeka Dubrova\u010dka is actually a ria, a flooded river valley formed through changes in sea surface elevation on a geologic time scale. The river rises as a karst spring fed by groundwater replenished by Trebi\u0161njica, which is an influent stream flowing in Popovo Polje, in the immediate hinterland of the Ombla. The elevation difference between the river's source and its mouth is just over 2 metres (6\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches). The average discharge of the river is 24.1 cubic metres (850 cubic feet) per second. The drainage basin of the Ombla encompasses 600 square kilometres (230 square miles) and, besides the short surface course, includes only groundwater flow.",
