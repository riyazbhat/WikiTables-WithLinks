  "/wiki/Chalk_(TV_series)": "Chalk is a British television sitcom set in a comprehensive school named Galfast High. Two series, both written by Steven Moffat, were broadcast on BBC1 in 1997. Like Moffat's earlier sitcom Joking Apart, Chalk was produced by Andre Ptaszynski for Pola Jones.\n The series focuses upon deputy headteacher Eric Slatt (David Bamber), permanently stressed over the chaos he creates both by himself and some of his eccentric staff. His wife Janet (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and new English teacher Suzy Travis (Nicola Walker) attempt to help him solve the problems.\n Because of the very good reaction of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Chalk_episodes": "Chalk is a BBC Television sitcom. The show was produced by Andre Ptaszynski for the independent production company Pola Jones and screened on BBC2. All twelve episodes from the two series were written by Steven Moffat and directed by Juliet May. The first episode of the series was transmitted on 20 February 1997, and the final transmitted on 22 October 1997.\n The series focuses upon deputy headteacher Eric Slatt (David Bamber), permanently stressed over the chaos he creates both by himself and some of his eccentric staff. His wife Janet (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and new English teacher Suzy Travis (Nicola Walker) attempt to help him solve the problems.\n Due to the positive reaction of the studio audience during recordings, a second series was commissioned before the first had aired. However, the first series attracted criticism, inflamed by the BBC's decision to compare the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers in its publicity materials. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.",
  "/wiki/Down_to_Earth_(2000_TV_series)": "Down to Earth is a BBC One television series first broadcast in 2000 about a couple who start a new life on a Devon farm. The early episodes of the series were based on a series of books written by Faith Addis about their real-life move from London to Devon.\n The music in the series was composed by Sheridan Tongue and Tony Hadley, and had the song \"After All this Time\" as its opening and closing credits in series 2 and 3.",
  "/wiki/Holby_City": "Holby City (styled as HOLBY CI+Y) is a British medical drama television series that airs weekly on BBC One. The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the established BBC medical drama Casualty, and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as Casualty in the fictional city of Holby, and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both Casualty (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as Casualty@Holby City) and the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off HolbyBlue. \n Its first executive producers were Young and Johnathan Young, who were succeeded by Kathleen Hutchison from 2002 to 2004, Richard Stokes from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, Oliver Kent from 2013 to 2017 and Simon Harper from 2017. Holby City airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.\n The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital. It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of around fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including Patsy Kensit, Jane Asher, Robert Powell, Ade Edmondson and John Michie.\n McHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the filmizing technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty series of Holby City have aired, and the twenty-first began airing from 2 January 2019. The show has run for over 900 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, and has featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, Holby City moved to high definition broadcasting.\n Holby City has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within the television and entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.\n Holby City has been nominated for over 100 television awards, of which it has won ten: the 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Continuing Drama, one BEFFTA Award, two Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards, two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four Screen Nation Awards. The show's first series averaged 9.27\u00a0million viewers, but apart from a rise in its fifth series, ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the eleventh series averaging 5.44\u00a0million viewers. The twelfth series saw a small rise to 5.62\u00a0million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4 million viewers per week.",

The series opening theme, \"Always & Forever\", was performed by Kylie Minogue.\n At first, the series rated well, even drawing comparisons to series such as Twin Peaks. However, as the series storylines became more bizarre and complex, it began to rate poorly, only gaining a small, cult fanbase, and was pushed to a later timeslot due to the lack of mainstream interest. Subsequently, little more than six months after the series premiered, filming wrapped on 17 May 2002, and the series was later axed by station executives, who cited low ratings as the principal reason. The final episode aired on screen on 5 June 2003.",
  "/wiki/Danielle_Cable:_Eyewitness": "Danielle Cable: Eyewitness (also known as Eyewitness: The Danielle Cable Story) is a British television true crime drama film, based upon the murder of Stephen Cameron by Kenneth Noye in a road rage incident in 1996. The film was co-written for television by playwrights Kate Brooke and Terry Winsor, and was directed by Adrian Shergold. It was first broadcast on ITV on 14 April 2003. The film details the events following the killing, in which the sole witness to the murder, Cameron's fianc\u00e9 Danielle Cable (Joanne Froggatt), is forced to change her identity and go into hiding after giving evidence which helped convict Noye in court.\n The film was screened on the third anniversary of Noye's conviction for Stephen's murder, which occurred on 14 April 2000. Prior to filming, Froggatt met with the real-life Danielle Cable in a secret location, while under the protection of two bodyguards who prevented Danielle from revealing any information that might lead to her being found. Frogatt was later nominated for the Royal Television Society Award for Best Actress for her role as Cable, and the film itself was also nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Single Drama. The film drew 8.59 million viewers on its debut broadcast. Notably, it has never been available on DVD.",
  "/wiki/The_Bill": "The Bill is a British police procedural television series, first broadcast on ITV from 16 October 1984 until 31 August 2010. The programme originated from a one-off drama, Woodentop, broadcast in August 1983.\n The programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of police officers, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. The Bill was the longest-running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom, and among the longest running of any British television series at the time of its cancellation. The title originates from \"Old Bill\", a slang term for the police.\n Although highly acclaimed by fans and critics, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis. The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a pre-watershed slot. The Bill won several awards, including BAFTAs, a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award, and Best Drama at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009, this being the series' fourth consecutive win.\n Throughout its 26-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including Gold, Alibi, Watch, Dave, and Drama. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission The Bill and that recording on the series would cease on 14 June 2010.

  "/wiki/The_Bill_(series_19)": "Series 19 of British television drama The Bill was broadcast from 1 January until 31 December 2003. The series consisted of 106 episodes, being the longest series broadcast during the show's final decade, and also included the show's first live broadcast, \"Fatal Consequences\". This series built upon the serialized format previously introduced by new producer Paul Marquess in Series 18, and also saw the introduction of several new members into the cast following the departure of many long-standing cast members in Series 18.\n This series saw the show celebrate its 20th Anniversary on air with both a live episode and an episode featuring one of the show's most ambitious stunts to date, where PC Des Taviner is supposedly killed in an explosion in a Gas Tower, after being exposed as the culprit of the Sun Hill fire, which claimed the lives of six officers, back in April 2002. This storyline also saw the return of former detective Sally Johnson (Jaye Griffiths), who ultimately exposes Taviner and also manages to bully DC Danny Glaze into tendering his resignation, in fear of his part in the plot to frame murder suspect Jeff Simpson being revealed. This series also saw the death of long-standing character Sgt. Matthew Boyden, whose death was the subject of the first episode of the series' new spin-off Murder Investigation Team.\n For the live broadcast, a storyline was devised whereby DC Juliet Becker (Rae Baker) was held hostage in the back of a police car at knifepoint. Despite only being in the show for five months, the storyline paved the way for Baker's exit. This episode also featured a live stunt in which DC Gary Best's father (Ian Puleston-Davies) is thrown from the roof of the station after getting into a fight with his son. All but three of the current cast members featured in the live broadcast, and thus, due to its success on the night, a second live broadcast was commissioned for 2005, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of ITV1.\n On 16 October 2013, the complete series was released on DVD in Australia as a Region 0, playable anywhere in the world. The DVD synopsis uses the original episode numbering system, rather than the Episode names which from 2002-2007 wasn't used",

When he realizes the information he holds, he re-opens the pain of loss in a family, and re-opens the question of who was the murderer two years ago.\n This novel received mixed reviews at the time of publication, as reviewers were not generally comfortable with the psychological aspects of the story. The plot had her \"customary ingenuity\" but lacked \"blitheness\" and was \"much too like an attempt at psychological fiction\". Sympathy is evoked for too many characters, \"but the unravelling is sound and the story well told.\" Another said there is ingenuity and a good ending, but the plot \"lacks a central focus\" and it appears that the \"serious socio-psychological approach doesn't suit\" Christie's writing. A later review considered it one of the better Christie novels of the 1950s, and noted that the author sometimes called it her own favourite.",
