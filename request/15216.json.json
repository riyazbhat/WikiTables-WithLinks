  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock, alt-pop or simply alternative) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s. In this instance, the word \"alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream, or commercial rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, DIY ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. In September of 1988, Billboard magazine introduced \"Alternative Songs\" into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts. By then \"alternative\" had become a catch-all description for both successful artists (e.g. U2 and R.E.M.), as well as music from underground, independent, or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition. Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s, music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s, with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett.
