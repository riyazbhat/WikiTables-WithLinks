  "/wiki/Peter_Pan": "Peter Pan is a fictional character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.\n Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include the 1924 silent film, 1953 Disney animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action film, a television series and many other works.",
  "/wiki/Documentary_film": "A documentary film is a non-fictional, motion picture intended to \"document reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record\". Documentary has been described as \"a filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries\". Documentary films were originally called actuality films, and were one minute, or less, in length. Over time, documentaries have evolved to be longer in length, and to include more categories; some examples being: educational, observational, and docufiction. Documentaries are meant to be informative works, and are often used within schools, as a resource to teach various principles.\n Social media platforms, such as YouTube, have provided an avenue for the growth of the documentary film genre; These platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility; thereby, enhancing the ability to educate a larger volume of viewers, and broadening the reach of persons who receive that information.",

  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary (a portmanteau of mock and documentary) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary.\n These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself. While mockumentaries are usually comedic, pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents. However, pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama, a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events. Also, docudrama is different from docufiction; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements.\n Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries, with B roll and talking heads discussing past events, or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events. Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available. A very early example was a short piece on the \"Swiss Spaghetti Harvest\" that appeared as an April Fools' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957.\n The term \"mockumentary\", which originated in the 1960s, was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film.\n Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised, as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality. Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks, also to sustain the atmosphere, although exceptions exist.\n Music \"is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music\".",
  "/wiki/American_Dad!": "American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman that originally premiered on Fox. American Dad! is the first television series to have its inception on the network's Animation Domination block. The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005.  The series is produced by Underdog Productions, Fuzzy Door Productions, and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.\n Creative direction of American Dad! has largely been guided by Barker (prior to his exit from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts. Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes, instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots. While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce. The plots are often absurd, but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues.\nAmerican Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, most prominently four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Since its debut, American Dad! has broadcast 276 episodes (as of August 26, 2019). The total number of seasons and organization of episodes within these seasons are in dispute because of a discrepancy in how official sources report this information. One model suggests the first season of American Dad! comprises the first 7 episodes, while another model suggests the first season comprises 23 episodes.\n Beginning on October 20, 2014, TBS picked up the series for the 12th season following the final 3 episodes airing on Fox as the 11th season. Previously, TBS and Cartoon Network (via their late-night block, Adult Swim), both owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia subsidiary, aired reruns of the series.\n American Dad!'s sixteenth and current season premiered on April 15, 2019. On January 15, 2020, TBS renewed the series for both an 18th and 19th season.",

To compensate for this, they aired the episode \"National Treasure 4: Baby Franny: She's Doing Well: The Hole Story\" early. \"Minstrel Krampus\" eventually aired in the tenth season.",
