  "/wiki/Single_transferable_vote": "The single transferable vote (STV) is a proportional voting system designed to achieve or closely approach proportional representation through voters ranking candidates in multi-seat organizations or constituencies (voting districts). There are various ways of counting votes under STV, as described below.",
  "/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting": "Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates.  Instead of indicating support for only one candidate, voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice.  If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that candidate wins. If not, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head. Compared to plurality voting, IRV can reduce the affect of vote-splitting when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters.",

It is a variation of instant-runoff voting (IRV), in which the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference.

If no candidate has a majority, then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and there is a second count, where the votes of those who supported eliminated candidates are distributed among the two remaining candidates.
