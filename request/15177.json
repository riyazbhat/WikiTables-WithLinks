The magazine decided therefore to launch Thailand's first-ever LGBT Festival, as LGBT people and issues have already gained acceptance in Thai society for many years, and several other countries in the East Asian region, which sometimes record less legal acceptance of LGBT issues than Thailand, such as Indonesia (which has held Asia's largest LGBT film festival, Q!

Despite the advances made over many years, the magazine believes that the LGBT community is not always portrayed in a positive light in Thai films and other forms of media, with certain stereotypes still prevalent whenever movies, in particular, address gender diversity.

  "/wiki/Bangkok": "Bangkok[a] is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon[b] or simply Krung Thep. [c] The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has a population of over eight million, 12.6 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census, making Bangkok the nation's primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy. Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.",
