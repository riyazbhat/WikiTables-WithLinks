  "/wiki/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party": "The Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP or NDP; French: Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique de l'Ontario) is a social-democratic political party in Ontario, Canada. The Ontario NDP, led by Andrea Horwath since March 2009, currently forms the Official Opposition in Ontario following the 2018 general election. It is a provincial section of the federal New Democratic Party. It was formed in October 1961 from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section) (Ontario CCF) and the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL).\n For many years, the Ontario NDP was the most successful provincial NDP branch outside the national party's western heartland. It had its first breakthrough under its first leader, Donald C. MacDonald in the 1967 provincial election, when the party elected 20 Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) to the Ontario Legislative Assembly. After the 1970 leadership convention, Stephen Lewis became leader, and guided the party to Official Opposition status in 1975, the first time since the Ontario CCF did it twice in the 1940s. After the party's disappointing performance in the 1977 provincial election, that included losing second party status, Lewis stepped down and Michael Cassidy was elected leader in 1978. Cassidy led the party through one campaign, the 1981 election. The party did poorly again, and Cassidy resigned.\n In 1982, Bob Rae was elected leader. Under his leadership, in 1985, the party held the balance-of-power with the signing of an accord with the newly elected Liberal minority government. After the 1987 Ontario general election, the ONDP became the Official Opposition again. The 1990 Ontario general election surprisingly produced the ONDP's breakthrough first government in 1990 (when the election was called it looked like the Liberals would win a second majority government). The victory produced the first NDP provincial government east of Manitoba. But it took power just when Canada's economy was in a recession, and as a result of unpopular economic policies it was defeated in 1995. Rae stepped down as leader in 1996.\n Howard Hampton was elected leader in at the 1996 Hamilton convention, and led the party through three elections. Hampton's period as leader saw the ONDP lose official party status twice: after the 1999 and 2003 elections. He was able to regain party status the first time after the governing Progressive Conservatives revised party status requirements in accordance with that election's reduction in the number of seats in the legislature, and the second time after winning a string of by-elections in the mid-2000s. The party maintained party status after the 2007 Ontario general election and he stepped down as leader in 2009.\n Andrea Horwath replaced him after she was elected leader at the 2009 leadership convention in Hamilton. Under her leadership in the 2011 Ontario general election, the party elected 17 MPPs to the legislature and in the 2014 Ontario general election, the party elected 21 MPPs. Under Horwath, the party achieved its second highest seat count ever (other than forming government in 1990) when it formed the Official Opposition with 40 MPPs after the 2018 Ontario general election.",

The school does not offer an Executive MBA or a part-time program, believing that such programs, while lucrative, would dilute the focus of its full-time MBA program.\n Tuck does, however, offer an Advanced Management Program for executives, which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course. In addition, Tuck offers a 4-week, intensive summer program to liberal arts students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts. \n Within Dartmouth, faculty from Tuck and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice are partnering to offer a Master of Health Care Delivery Science degree from Dartmouth College. Moreover, Tuck partners with the Thayer School of Engineering to teach management courses through a Master of Engineering Management program offered by Thayer School of Engineering.\n Compared to other elite business schools, Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size \u2014 each MBA class consists of about 280 students. As such, both factors, combined with Tuck's commitment to the full-time MBA program attribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries. Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school, the highest rate among business schools worldwide.\n The MBA program has held a top-10 ranking in multiple publications, including U.S. News & World Report, Bloomberg, The Economist, Forbes, Business Insider, and Vault. According to U.S. News & World Report, MBA graduates of Tuck  earned an average $158,194 first year compensation, the fifth highest of all US-based MBA programs. Tuck's MBA program also ties for 9th place with MIT for the highest average GMAT score of 722 for its entering class.\n The school is one of six Ivy League business schools, alongside Wharton, HBS, CBS, Johnson, and Yale SOM.",

  "/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland": "The Parliament of Finland (Finnish: Suomen eduskunta, Swedish: Finlands riksdag) is the unicameral supreme legislature of Finland, founded on 9 May 1906. In accordance with the Constitution of Finland, sovereignty belongs to the people, and that power is vested in the Parliament. The Parliament consists of 200 members, 199 of whom are elected every four years from 13 multi-member districts electing 7-36 using the proportional D'Hondt method. In addition, there is one member from \u00c5land.\n Legislation may be initiated by either the Government or one of the members of Parliament. The Parliament passes legislation, decides on the state budget, approves international treaties, and supervises the activities of the government. It may bring about the resignation of the Finnish Government, override presidential vetoes, and alter the constitution. To make changes to the constitution, amendments must be approved by two successive parliaments, with an election cycle in between, or passed as an emergency law with a 166/200 majority. Most MPs work in parliamentary groups which correspond with the political parties. The Parliament currently comprises nine parliamentary groups. Since the establishment of the Parliament in 1905, the parliamentary majority has been held once by a single party: the Social Democrats in the 1916 election. Thus, for the Government to gain a majority in the Parliament, coalition governments are favored. These are generally formed by at least two of the three historically major parties: the Social Democrats, Centre, and National Coalition. Ministers are often but not necessarily MPs. The Parliament meets in the Parliament House (Finnish: Eduskuntatalo, Swedish: Riksdagshuset), which is located in central Helsinki.\n The most recent parliamentary election took place on 14 April 2019. The Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party, the Green League, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party cooperated to form the Rinne Cabinet, a centre-left coalition government. This was succeeded in December 2019 by the Marin Cabinet which is made up of the same parties.",
