  "/wiki/Warren_Central_High_School_(Indiana)": "Warren Central High School, also known as Warren, WC, or WCHS, is a public high school located in Warren Township on the far east side of Indianapolis, Indiana. It is the only high school in Warren Township with an enrollment of 3,736 students, in grades 9-12, as of the 2016-2017 school year. Warren Central is known as \"The Pride of the Eastside\". Its school colors are Black and Vegas Gold and the nickname is the Warriors. The school fight song is Rah, rah for Warren. The original Warren Central opened on January 12, 1925, at the corner of 10th Street and Post Road on the far east side of Indianapolis.  It was a consolidation of the Cumberland and Shadeland schools which both had high schools that were too small for the growing township population.  Warren Central was built to house grades 7 to 12 and to give the students a city quality education in a farm community. By the late 1950s, the population of Warren Township had once again outgrown its high school and, on September 6, 1960, a new Warren Central opened at its present location off of 9500 East 16th Street.  In 1976, the Walker Career Center opened on the property of the high school.",
