  "/wiki/Academy_Award": "The Academy Awards, more popularly known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry. Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the \"Academy Award of Merit\", although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the \"Oscar\". The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the Art Deco style.\n The award was originally sculpted by George Stanley from a design sketch by Cedric Gibbons. AMPAS first presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in what would become known as the 1st Academy Awards. The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide. It is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards; its other three equivalents \u2013 the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music \u2013 are modeled after the Academy Awards.\n The 91st Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2018, was held on February 24, 2019, at the Dolby Theatre, in Los Angeles, California. The ceremony was broadcast on ABC. A total of 3,096 Oscar statuettes have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 91st ceremony.  It was the first ceremony since 1989 not to have a host.\n The 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2019, was held on February 9, 2020. The ceremony was again broadcast on ABC. It took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, for the 18th consecutive year.",

This was the largest age difference between two competing actors in Oscar history until 2013.  Their age difference was partially the reason why Douglas did not attend the Oscars that night, despite winning the award.  Henry was nominated for Kramer vs. Kramer, which out of its eight other nominations, finished with five awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton, and Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman.",

  "/wiki/Superman_(1978_film)": "Superman (as titled onscreen; also known as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 superhero film directed by Richard Donner, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. An international co-production between the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Panama and the United States, the film stars an ensemble cast featuring Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Jeff East, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, Jack O'Halloran, Maria Schell, and Sarah Douglas. It depicts the origin of Superman (Reeve), including his infancy as Kal-El of Krypton, son of Jor-El (Brando) and his youthful years in the rural town of Smallville. Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane (Kidder), while battling the villainous Lex Luthor (Hackman).\n Several directors, most notably Guy Hamilton, and screenwriters (Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton), were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct. Tom Mankiewicz was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a \"creative consultant\" credit. It was decided to film both Superman and its sequel Superman II (1980) simultaneously, with principal photography beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions arose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film.\n The most expensive film made up to that point,[citation needed] with a budget of $55 million, Superman was released in December 1978 to critical and financial success; its worldwide box office earnings of $300 million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year. It received praise for Reeve's performance, and was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound, and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects. Groundbreaking in its use of special effects and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the film's legacy presaged the mainstream popularity of Hollywood's superhero film franchises. In 2017, Superman was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.",

The ceremonies were presided over by Johnny Carson.\n Chariots of Fire was the surprise winner (with a leading 12 nominations, Reds had been expected to win) of the Best Picture Oscar.  It was the first time in 13 years that a British film won the Academy's top honor.  The next year's winner, Gandhi, was also a British production.\n Henry Fonda won his only competitive Oscar this year, as Best Actor for On Golden Pond.  At 76 years of age, Fonda became the oldest winner in the Best Actor category in Academy history.  The only other nomination he received in his career was Best Actor for his performance in The Grapes of Wrath 41 years earlier \u2013 a record gap between acting nominations.  His co-star, Katharine Hepburn, won her fourth Best Actress award, extending her own record for the most Best Actress wins by any actress.\n This year's nominations also marked the second time (after 1967) that three different films were nominated for the \"Big Five\" Academy Awards: Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. The three films were On Golden Pond, Atlantic City and Reds. However, none of them won the Best Picture prize, losing to Chariots of Fire. This also marked the first year that the award for Best Makeup was presented; the winner was Rick Baker for his work on An American Werewolf in London.\n This was the last year until the 2005 Oscars where all five Best Picture nominations were also nominated for Best Director. Reds was the last film to gain nominations in all four acting categories until Silver Linings Playbook matched that feat at the 85th Academy Awards ceremony in 2013. Facilitated in part by their advanced ages at the time (77, 76, 74 and a \"young\" 56), this is also the most recent ceremony (as of the 2017 presentation of the 89th Academy Awards) for which the four acting award winners are all now deceased \u2013 though two of the four did live into their late 90s.\n Chariots of Fire became the last film to win Best Picture and not win for directing\nuntil Driving Miss Daisy in 1990.\n Similar to 1976 and 1977, these Oscars were scheduled directly opposite the NCAA basketball championship game, which this year was broadcast on CBS.  Beginning in 1983, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Game would take place on the Monday following the Academy Awards.",
