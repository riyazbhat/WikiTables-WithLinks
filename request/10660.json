MD 228, which is a four-lane divided highway for its entire length, is a major commuter route between southwestern Prince George's County and northern Charles County.  In conjunction with MD 210, the state highway serves as an alternative to US 301 and MD 5 as a route to Washington, D.C. from Southern Maryland.  MD 228 also serves as part of the connection, again via MD 210, between Waldorf and Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center.\n MD 228 did not originally connect Waldorf with Accokeek; instead, the state highway headed west from Waldorf and turned south near the Prince George's \u2013 Charles county line, following what is now MD 229 to Pomfret.  The state highway was built from Pomfret to Berry in the late 1920s.  MD 228 was completed between Berry and Waldorf in the mid-1930s.  MD 228 was expanded to a divided highway in Charles County and extended into Prince George's County in the mid-1990s.

The highway runs from  Point Lookout in St. Mary's County north to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland, Prince George's County. MD 5 begins as the two-lane undivided Point Lookout Road which runs from Point Lookout, St. Mary's County, to an intersection with MD 235 in the northern part of the county.  Point Lookout Road passes through rural areas as well as the county seat of Leonardtown. After the MD 235 intersection, the route becomes the four-lane divided Three Notch Road and continues into Charles County, where it becomes Leonardtown Road. Here, the route bypasses Hughesville and continues north toward the Waldorf area, which it bypasses to the east on Mattawoman Beantown Road. The route merges onto U.S. Route 301 (US 301, Crain Highway) and enters Prince George's County, splitting from US 301 at an interchange in Brandywine. From here, MD 5 continues north on Branch Avenue, running through suburban areas, before becoming a freeway as it passes Andrews Air Force Base and interchanges with Interstate 95 (I-95)/I-495 (Capital Beltway). Past the Capital Beltway, the route runs through suburban areas of Hillcrest Heights and Suitland before reaching the D.C. border, where Branch Avenue SE continues, crossing Pennsylvania Avenue SE and eventually terminating at Randle Circle.\n MD 5 was designated in 1927 to run from Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. line in 1939, while MD 637 was designated along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border. Between 1939 and 1949, the route continued into Washington, D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 (DC 5), which followed Naylor Road SE, Good Hope Road SE, 11th Street SE, and DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House. MD 5 was realigned to head to the Washington, D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950. During the course of the 1950s and 1960s, most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington, D.C. border was widened into a divided highway. In 1993, the route bypassed Leonardtown; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) before it was decommissioned in 2012. In 1997, MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989. The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301.

It is a \u200b2 1\u20442-story gable-roofed house of common bond brick, built about 1850. The house has a basic Georgian plan. It is the only brick house in Charles County dating between the years 1835 and 1880. The house was built by Francis Caleb Green, on part of the 2,400 acres (970 ha) of land granted in 1666 to the sons of Thomas Greene, the second Provincial Governor of Maryland, who named it \"Green's Inheritance.\"\n Green's Inheritance, formerly known as \"Green Park\", and home to the wealthy and prominent branch of the Green Family of Charles County, is a simple but dignified 2 1/2-story gable roofed house of common bond brick, 56' by 36'. Built c. 1850, it has a basic Georgian plan, incorporating an interesting combination of late Federal and Greek Revival features. The five-bay principal facade faces southeast. The centered, double-leafed entrance door, with transom and sidelights, has a simple Greek Revival-style wood enframement. The proportions and simplicity of a one-story porch with shallow pedimented roof and square posts sheltering the entrance suggest a Greek Revival influence. The four windows on the first floor and five on the second frame 6/6 sash and have plain wood sills and flat wood lintels. On the latter, at both floor levels, are flat pieces of wood applied in a manner to suggest recessed flat arches within the rectangular lintels, a rather curious treatment that is apparently original. A second interesting feature is a four-course brick belt or panel below the stepped brick roof cornice that extends to within 18\" of the ends of the house. The north, or rear, elevation repeats the same fenestration and door placement of the front. However, the wood lintels of the windows are unornamented, and there is no belt course or panel below the eave cornice, and no porch sheltering the door. The door, fronted by a semi-circular brick stoop, is framed in the same basic manner as the front, but has a simulated, all-wood overlight. In 1941 a one-story porch extending the full width of this elevation was removed and replaced by the existing brick stoop and brick terrace. The east end of the house is unbroken except for a window at the attic level. On the west side there is a centered window at the second floor. The roof has two flush gable chimneys at each end. On the front and back slopes of the roof are three pedimented dormer windows, each of 6/6 sash. There is no watertable at the base of the house, although at one time the first several courses up from ground level were painted black. Small metal grilled openings at the base of the building serve to ventilate the crawl space beneath the first floor joists. In 1941 a one-story, three-bay kitchen addition of old brick with a shallow gable roof was built against the west end of the house, replacing an older frame wing.\n Green's Inheritance is an important landmark, regionally significant architecturally and historically. Its architecture and date of construction very nearly make it unique within the lower Southern Maryland region.\n In about 1825 the counties of Charles, Calvert, St. Mary's, and lower Prince George's began feeling the accumulated effect of a series of economic depressions, the last caused in large measure by the over-cultivation of tobacco, changing agricultural practices, industrialization, and the shifting of a rural society to one more urban. During the two decades preceding and following the Civil War almost all building activity ceased within the region. Green's Inheritance is therefore one of only a handful of extant buildings dating from this period in this area. It is, in fact, the only brick house in Charles County dating between the years 1835 and 1880. Considering the critical economic situation of the region at this time, it is remarkable that anyone could afford such an extravagance, particularly when many families of greater wealth and social prominence were crumbling.\n The house should then be recognized as a testament to the builder, who buy all accounts was a quiet, honest yet resourceful and imaginative \"gentleman farmer.\" The significance of Green's Inheritance, however, lies not only in its architectural value but also in the history of the property and the Green family. The house is believed to have been built about 1850 by Francis Caleb Green, on land granted in 1666 to the sons of Thomas Green, the second Provincial Governor of Maryland. Francis Caleb Green (1795-1851) held the rank of Sergeant during the War of 1812-14, and was actively involved in county affairs. His son, Francis Basil Green (1832-1907), was also active in local affairs, but especially in the concerns of nearby St. Joseph's Church, to which he donated land for expansion. His children sold the house to the late Major General DeWitt Peck, U.S.M.C., in 1941. It was during Peck's tenure that many of the renovations took place.\n The well-documented affairs of the Green family provide more than a superficial glimpse into the life of an average Maryland family throughout a period of some 250 years. The house, as a part of this record, provides a valuable focal point on which a historical study of socio-economic conditions in Southern Maryland, as reflected by the activities of several generations of a single family, could be based.\n Green's Inheritance was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.",

Marshall Hall is located near Bryan's Road in Charles County, Maryland, next to the Potomac River, more or less across from Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of George Washington.  The home was one of the finest built on the Maryland shore of the Potomac in the early 18th century.  The Marshall family were minor gentry and owned as many as 80 slaves by the early 19th century.\n Soon after the Civil War, the site became a highly frequented picnic ground because of its proximity to Mount Vernon. Steamship lines, originally established to ferry tourists from Washington D.C. and Alexandria to/from Mount Vernon, discovered a new source of revenue in the park across from the historic estate. In the 1880s, the Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall Steamboat Company ran large ships between Washington, Alexandria, Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall: the round-trip fare at that time was $1, and included admission to Mount Vernon. Washingtonians fled the summer heat of the city for all sorts of events at the picnic grounds, from exclusive catered events to popular cultural events such as a swimming exhibition given by the daredevil Robert Emmet Odlum in the summer of 1878, seven years before his death at the Brooklyn Bridge.  Marshall Hall later became one of the first amusement parks in the Washington, D.C., area in the 1890s, offering numerous \"appliances of entertainment\" (as one deed described them) for visitors who wanted to do more than picnic, many of them arriving by river boat.  Starting in the 1870s, annual jousting tournaments took place at the site.  New attractions were added throughout the 20th century, and gambling became a major draw for a while after World War II.  Between 1949 and 1968, the Southern Maryland area offered the only legal slot machines in the United States outside of Nevada.\n The National Park Service gained control of the park after Congress, acting upon a request from the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, mandated that the views from Mt. Vernon had to be protected and returned to something resembling the days when George Washington sat on his colonnaded porch and looked across the Potomac.[citation needed] The term \"historic viewshed\" was coined for this act of preservation.[citation needed] The Park Service tore down all vestiges of the amusement park in 1980, whose popularity had declined due to competition by much larger, newer parks.  A fire destroyed much of the colonial house soon after. In January 2003, a truck driver slammed his rig through the remaining hulk. The damage done to the brick shell was repaired the following year.[citation needed]",

The construction of Maryland Route 210 (Indian Head Highway) during World War II brought new traffic. By the early 1960s, Bryans Road became an established bedroom community for both Indian Head and Washington.\n At the main intersection of Bryans Road, a shopping center includes supermarkets, gas stations, and assorted retail stores that serve the community. Local residents commute to work at the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center, while others commute to employment centers throughout the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. In 1998, plans for a massive housing development project at Chapman's Landing were thwarted by the Maryland state government, which bought the property to preserve green space under its smart growth policy.\nMarshall Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and Mount Aventine was listed in the Register in 1996.",
