  "/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire": "\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (15 April 1772\u00a0\u2013 19 June 1844) was a French naturalist who established the principle of \"unity of composition\".  He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck's evolutionary theories.  Geoffroy's scientific views had a transcendental flavor (unlike Lamarck's materialistic views) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken. He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time, amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology.",
  "/wiki/Endangered": "An endangered species is a species which has been categorized  as very likely to become extinct in the near future. Endangered (EN), as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after Critically Endangered\u00a0(CR). In 2012, the IUCN Red List featured 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered\u00a0(EN) worldwide. The figures for 1998 were 1,102 and 1,197 respectively.

  "/wiki/Gray-headed_lemur": "The gray-headed lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps), or gray-headed brown lemur, is a medium-sized primate, a cathemeral species of lemur in the family Lemuridae. Until a taxonomic revision in 2008, it was known as the white-collared brown lemur or white-collared lemur (Eulemur albocollaris). It lives in south-eastern Madagascar. In 2005, satellite imagery estimates showed approximately 700\u00a0km2 (270\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of total remaining habitat within its geographic range. It is highly threatened by hunting and habitat loss, and was considered to be among the 25 most endangered primates in 2006\u20132008. It is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to a highly restricted range, and has been named one of \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\"",
