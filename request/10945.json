It has been celebrated in Japan for more than 500 years and traditionally includes a dance, known as Bon Odori.\n The festival of Obon lasts for three days; however, its starting date varies within different regions of Japan. When the lunar calendar was changed to the Gregorian calendar at the beginning of the Meiji era, the localities in Japan responded differently, which resulted in three different times of Obon. Shichigatsu Bon (Bon in July) is based on the solar calendar and is celebrated around the 15th of July in eastern Japan (Kant\u014d region such as Tokyo, Yokohama and the T\u014dhoku region), coinciding with Ch\u016bgen. Hachigatsu Bon (Bon in August), based on the lunar calendar, is celebrated around the August 15 and is the most commonly celebrated time. Ky\u016b Bon (Old Bon) is celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and so differs each year, which appears between August 8 and September 7.

A distinct and separate group of performers from the chorus, they are purely instrumentalists; the type of instruments featured and the order in which they sit on stage follow established practices. The leftmost performer plays a small taiko, set on a stand before him, with two drumsticks. To his right is the \u014dtsuzumi hip drum, followed by the kotsuzumi shoulder drum, and the Noh flute (n\u014dkan or simply fue).\n In kabuki, a number of shamisen players are added, along with, depending on the play, taiko drums of various sizes, various types of flutes, and other instruments, including a myriad of devices for sound effects. The kabuki hayashi is generally located in a small room just off-stage, and is not visible to the audience, though a barred window in the walls of the stage set indicates its location. For matsubame plays and dances, those based on works from Noh and ky\u014dgen, the hayashi will often be located along the rear of the stage, fully visible in imitation of Noh and ky\u014dgen modes.\n As with kabuki actors, and other performers in traditional arts, instrumentalists in the traditions of Noh hayashi, kabuki hayashi, and nagauta shamisen (the shamisen style used in kabuki and bunraku), are members of a number of traditional lineages, following the iemoto system. Performers traditionally take on the name of their school as an art-name (i.e. stage name). Notable hayashi lineages include the T\u014dsha school, Mochizuki school, and Tanaka school. Nagauta shamisen schools include the Kineya school and Imafuji school, among others.\n In a rakugo yose, the music includes shamisen and percussion parts.

  "/wiki/Shinto": "Shinto,[a] also known as Shintoism or kami-no-michi,[b] is a religion originating from Japan. Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion, its practitioners often regard it as Japan's indigenous religion. Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists, although adherents rarely use that term themselves.\n Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami (\"gods\" or \"spirits\"), supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things. The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic. The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines, family shrines, and public shrines. The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion's adherents. Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances, age specific celebrations, and seasonal festivals. These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri. A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing. Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity, reverence for kami, and regular communion following seasonal practices. Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text, but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms.\n Belief in kami can be traced to the Yayoi period (1000 BCE to 300 CE), although similar concepts existed already during the late J\u014dmon period (see Ko-Shint\u014d), but their veneration was more simplistic than in later periods. At the end of the Kofun period (300 to 538 CE), Buddhism entered Japan and influenced kami veneration. Through Buddhist influence, kami came to be depicted anthropomorphically and were situated within Buddhist cosmology. Religious syncretisation made kami worship and Buddhism functionally inseparable, a process called Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d. The earliest written tradition regarding kami worship was recorded in the eighth-century Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. In ensuing centuries, Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d was adopted by Japan's Imperial household. During the Meiji era (1868 to 1912 CE), Japan's leadership expelled Buddhist influence from Shinto and formed State Shinto, which they utilized as a method for fomenting nationalism and imperial worship. Shrines came under growing government influence, and the Emperor of Japan was elevated to a particularly high position as a kami. With the formation of the Japanese Empire in the early 20th century, Shinto was exported to other areas of East Asia. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, Shinto was formally separated from the state. \n Shinto is primarily found in Japan, where there are around 80,000 public shrines; the country's shrine organization claims 113 million adherents. Shinto is also practiced elsewhere, in smaller numbers. Only a minority of Japanese people identify as religious, although most of the population take part in Shinto matsuri and Buddhist activities, especially festivals, and seasonal events. This reflects a common view in Japanese culture that the beliefs and practices of different religions need not be exclusive. Aspects of Shinto have also been incorporated into various Japanese new religious movements.",
  "/wiki/Kami": "Kami is the Japanese word for a god, deity, divinity, or spirit. It has been used to describe mind (\u5fc3\u970a), God (\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9), supreme being (\u81f3\u4e0a\u8005), one of the Shinto deities, an effigy, a principle, and anything that is worshipped.\n Although deity is the common interpretation of kami, some Shinto scholars argue that such a translation can cause a misunderstanding of the term.[page\u00a0needed] The wide variety of usage of the word kami can be compared to the Sanskrit Deva and the Hebrew Elohim, which also refer to God, gods, angels, or spirits.\n The etymological origin of the word kami is from proto-Japonic kamugami (\u201eto shine (into the eye)\u201c) or kagami (\u201emirror\u201c), and was used to describe the characteristics of the kami. The word was first used during the Yayoi period and linked to the early Japanese culture. The most likely origin comes from old-Japanese kami \u4e0a (\"the ones above\").\n Some other etymological suggestions are:",
