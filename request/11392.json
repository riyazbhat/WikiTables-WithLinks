  "/wiki/Veronica_(song)": "Veronica is a single from Elvis Costello's 1989 album Spike, co-written by Costello with Paul McCartney. The song Veronica was co-produced by T-Bone Burnett and Kevin Killen, and features Paul McCartney on his iconic H\u00f6fner bass. In 2004, Entertainment Weekly voted it one of Costello's top ten greatest tunes. The song focuses on an older woman who has experienced severe memory loss. Costello's inspiration for this song was his grandmother, who suffered from Alzheimer's. When talking about the song on a VH1 interview, Costello reminisced about his grandmother having terrifying moments of lucidity and how this was the inspiration for Veronica. In his 2015 autobiography, Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink, Costello wrote of his collaboration with McCartney, I'd brought an early version of Veronica that you would have recognized [\u2026] All the words I'd already written were about my paternal grandmother, Molly, or more formally, Mabel Josephine Jackson.
