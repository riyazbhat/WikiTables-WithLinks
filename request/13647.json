  "/wiki/Concept_car": "A concept car (also known as a concept vehicle, show vehicle or prototype) is a car made to showcase new styling and/or new technology. They are often shown at motor shows to gauge customer reaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be mass-produced. General Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the concept car, and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows of the 1950s.\n Concept cars never go into production directly. In modern times all would have to undergo many changes before the design is finalized for the sake of practicality, safety, regulatory compliance, and cost. A \"production-intent\" prototype, as opposed to a concept vehicle, serves this purpose.",

  "/wiki/SUVs": "Sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a category of motor vehicles that combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive. \n There is no commonly agreed definition of an SUV, and usage varies between countries. Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as per passenger cars), however in many cases crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs. In some countries\u2014such as the United States\u2014SUVs have been classified as \"light trucks\", resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars.\n The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949. The 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style. Most SUVs produced today use unibody construction (as per passenger cars); however, in the past many SUVs used body-on-frame construction.\n During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons. More recently, smaller SUVs, mid-size and crossovers have become increasingly popular. SUVs are currently the world's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world's passenger car market in 2017.\n SUVs are criticised for their impact on other road users and the environment. Elements of their design introduce safety risks both to their drivers and to others, and they are considered a leading cause of the increase in pedestrian deaths in the United States over the past decade. They are typically less fuel efficient than smaller vehicles, thus contributing more to global warming.",
  "/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)": "A crossover\u2014 also called crossover or CUV\u2014 is a type of vehicle with unibody construction. Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car; compared to truck-based SUVs, they typically have better interior comfort, a more comfortable ride, and superior fuel economy, but less off-road capability.  Poor off-road capability is compounded by many crossovers being sold without all-wheel drive, which challenges their definition as \"sports utility vehicles\".\n Furthermore, there are various inconsistencies about whether some vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs; therefore the term SUV is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and compact SUVs.\n Forerunners of the crossover include the 1977 Matra Rancho and AMC Eagle introduced in 1979.\n In the United States as of 2006[update], crossover models comprised more than 50% of the overall SUV market. Crossovers have also become increasingly popular in Europe since the early 2010s.",
