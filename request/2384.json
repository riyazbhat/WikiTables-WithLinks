  "/wiki/Communes_of_France": "The commune (French pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[k\u0254myn]) is a level of administrative division in the French Republic. French communes are analogous to civil townships and incorporated municipalities in the United States and Canada, Gemeinden in Germany, comuni in Italy or ayuntamiento in Spain.

Communes are based on historical geographic communities or villages and are vested with significant powers to manage the populations and land of the geographic area covered.  The communes are the fourth-level administrative divisions of France.",
