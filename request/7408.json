  "/wiki/Airbus_A319": "The Airbus A319 is a member of the Airbus A320 family of short- to medium-range, narrow-body, commercial passenger twin-engine jet airliners manufactured by Airbus.[b] The A319 carries 124 to 156 passengers and has a maximum range of 3,700 nmi (6,900 km; 4,300 mi). Final assembly of the aircraft takes place in Hamburg, Germany and Tianjin, China.\n The A319 is a shortened-fuselage variant of the Airbus A320 and entered service in April 1996 with Swissair, around two years after the stretched Airbus A321 and eight years after the original A320. The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training.\n As of August 2019, a total of 1,480 Airbus A319 aircraft have been delivered, of which 1,436 are in service. In addition, another 42 airliners are on firm order (comprising 7 A319ceo and 35 A319neo). As of August 2019, American Airlines was the largest operator of the Airbus A319, operating 131 aircraft.\n In December 2010, Airbus announced a new generation of the A320 family, the A320neo (new engine option). The similarly shortened fuselage A319neo variant offers new, more efficient engines, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named \"sharklets\" by Airbus. The aircraft promises fuel savings of up to 15%.",
  "/wiki/Airbus_A320": "The Airbus A320 family are narrow-body airliners designed and produced by Airbus.\nThe A320 was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France.\nThe first member of the family was followed by the longer A321 (first delivered in January 1994), the shorter A319 (April 1996), and the even shorter A318 (July 2003).\nFinal assembly takes place in Toulouse in France; Hamburg in Germany; Tianjin in China since 2009; and in Mobile, Alabama in the United States since April 2016.\n The twinjet has a six-abreast cross-section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans, except the CFM56/PW6000 powered A318.\nThe family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls in airliners.\nVariants offer maximum take-off weights from 68 to 93.5 t (150,000 to 206,000 lb), to cover a 3,100\u20133,750 nmi (5,740\u20136,940 km) range.\nThe 31.4 m (103 ft) long A318 typically accommodates 107 to 132 passengers.\nThe 124-156 seats A319 is 33.8 m (111 ft) long.\nThe A320 is 37.6 m (123 ft) long and can accommodate 150 to 186 passengers.\nThe 44.5 m (146 ft) A321 offers 185 to 230 seats.\nThe Airbus Corporate Jets are business jet versions. \n In December 2010, Airbus announced the re-engined A320neo (new engine option), which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016.\nWith more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 15% better fuel economy.\nEarlier A320s are now called A320ceo (current engine option).\n In October 2019, it surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest-selling airliner.\nAs of December 2019, a total of 9,247 aircraft have been delivered to more than 330 operators including low-cost carriers, with 8,796 aircraft in service. American Airlines is the largest operator with 412 aircraft.[b] Orders pending were 6,068, for a total of 15,315 orders.\nThe A320ceo initially competed with the MD-80 and the 737 Classic, then the MD-90 and the 737 Next Generation, while the 737 MAX is a response to the A320neo.",
  "/wiki/Airbus_A330": "The Airbus A330 is a wide-body airliner made by Airbus.\nIn the mid-1970s, Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300, its first airliner, and developed the A330 twinjet in parallel with the A340 quadjet.\nIn June 1987, Airbus launched both designs with their first orders.\nThe A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994.\nThe slightly shorter A330-200 variant followed in 1998.\nIn 2014, Airbus launched the A330neo, re-engined with Trent 7000 turbofans, which entered service in November 2018.\n The A330 has a similar airframe to early A340, except for the number of engines: two instead of four, landing gear and weights.\nBoth airliners have fly-by-wire controls, which was first introduced on the A320, as well as a similar glass cockpit.\nThe A330 was Airbus's first airliner to offer a choice of three engines: the General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or the Rolls-Royce Trent 700.\n The A330-300 has a range of 11,750 km or 6,350 nmi with 277 passengers, while the shorter A330-200 can cover 13,450 km or 7,250 nmi with 247 passengers.\nLater variants include the A330-200F dedicated freighter, the A330 MRTT military tanker, and the ACJ330 corporate jet.\nThe A330 MRTT was proposed as the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 for the US Air Force's KC-X competition, but lost to the Boeing KC-46 in appeal after an initial win.\n As of December 2019, A330 orders stand at 1,823 of which 1,492 have been delivered and 1,443 remain in operation.\nIts largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 68 aircraft.\nThe A330 has allowed Airbus to expand its wide-body market share.\nIt competes with the Boeing 767 and smaller variants of the 777 and the 787.\nIt is complemented by the larger Airbus A350 XWB which succeeded the A340.",
  "/wiki/Boeing_737_Classic": "The Boeing 737 Classic are narrow-body airliners produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the second generation of the original Boeing 737-100/-200.\nDevelopment began in 1979 and the first variant, the 737-300, first flew in February 1984 and entered service in December of that year.\nThe stretched 737-400 first flew in February 1988 and entered service later that year\nThe shortest 737-500 first flew in June 1989 and entered service in 1990.\n It is re-engined with higher bypass ratio CFM56 turbofans for a better fuel economy and has upgraded avionics.\nWith a 133,500\u2013150,000 lb (60.6\u201368.0 t) MTOW, it has a range of 2,060 to 2,375 nmi (3,815 to 4,398 km).\nAt 102 ft (31 m), the -500 is similar in length to the original 737-200 and can fly 110 to 132 passengers.\nThe 110 ft (33.4 m) long -300 can seat 126 to 149 passengers while the 120 ft (36.4 m) long -400 accommodates 147 to 168 seats.\n It competed with the MD-80 family, then with the Airbus A320 which prompted Boeing to update its offer with the 737 Next Generation, thus designating the -300/400/500 variants the 737 classic.\nIn total, 1,988 aircraft were delivered until the year 2000: 1,113 -300s, 486 -400s and 389 -500s.",
  "/wiki/Boeing_757": "The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow-body short to medium range, twin-engine airliner that was designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of 3,150 to 4,100 nautical miles (5,830 to 7,590 km), depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and, owing to shared features, pilots can obtain a common type rating that allows them to operate both aircraft.\n The 757 was produced in two fuselage lengths. The original 757-200 entered service in 1983; the 757-200PF, a package freighter (PF) variant, and the 757-200M, a passenger-freighter combi model, debuted in the late 1980s. The stretched 757-300, the longest narrow-body twinjet ever produced, began service in 1999. Passenger 757-200s have been modified to special freighter (SF) specification for cargo use, while military derivatives include the C-32 transport, VIP carriers, and other multi-purpose aircraft. Private and government operators have also customized the 757 for research and transport roles. All 757s are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 series turbofans.\n Eastern Air Lines and British Airways placed the 757 in commercial service in 1983. The narrow-body twinjet succeeded earlier single-aisle airliners, and became commonly used for short and mid-range domestic routes, shuttle services, and transcontinental U.S. flights. After regulators granted approval for extended flights over water (ETOPS) in 1986, airlines also began using the aircraft for intercontinental routes. Major customers for the 757 included U.S. mainline carriers, European charter airlines, and cargo companies.\n Production of the 757 ended in October 2004, after 1,050 had been built for 54 customers. The 757-200 was by far the most popular model, with 913 built. Diminished sales amid an airline industry trending toward smaller jetliners led Boeing to end production without a direct replacement, in favor of the 737 family. The last 757 was delivered to Shanghai Airlines in November 2005. In July 2017, 666 of the narrow-body twinjets were in airline service; Delta Air Lines was the largest operator with 127 aircraft.\nThe airliner has recorded eleven hull-loss accidents, including eight fatal crashes, as of June 2019[update].",
