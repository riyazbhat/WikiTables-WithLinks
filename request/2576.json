  "/wiki/Balto": "Balto (1919 \u2013 March 14, 1933) was a Siberian Husky and sled dog who led his team on the final leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome, in which diphtheria antitoxin was transported from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nenana, Alaska, by train and then to Nome by dog sled to combat an outbreak of the disease.  While Balto received immediate recognition from most press channels of the day, it was later discovered that another dog contributed significantly more to the success of the run. Togo, a Siberian Husky under the same owner as Balto, ran over 250 miles, while Balto ran only the last 30. Togo was later recognized by Time magazine in 2011 as the \"most heroic animal of all time.\" Balto was named after the Sami explorer Samuel Balto. Balto rested at the Cleveland Zoo until his death on March 14, 1933, at the age of 14. After he died, his body was mounted and kept in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where it remains today.",
