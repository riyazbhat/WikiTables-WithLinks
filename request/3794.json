  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game.  Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched.  One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning.  Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1,  72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings, \u200b72 2\u20443 innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively.\n Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched. It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched. Alternatively, it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs. He'll throw one pitch which will result in a triple play, and for that one pitch he'll be credited with a full inning pitched.",
