  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications, a call sign (also known as a call name or call letters\u2014and historically as a call signal\u2014or abbreviated as a call) is a unique designation for a transmitter station. In the United States of America, they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters. A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency, informally adopted by individuals or organizations, or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station's identity.",
  "/wiki/Effective_radiated_power": "Effective radiated power (ERP), synonymous with equivalent radiated power,  is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency (RF) power, such as that emitted by a radio transmitter.  It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam (main lobe).  ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.   It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna.  It is used in electronics and telecommunications, particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area.",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis.",
  "/wiki/Height_above_average_terrain": "Height above average terrain (HAAT), or (less popularly) effective height above average terrain (EHAAT), is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico  have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this).",
  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre (Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling) or meter (American spelling) (from the French unit m\u00e8tre, from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd, \"measure\") is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI).
