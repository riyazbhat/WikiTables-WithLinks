  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications, a call sign (also known as a call name or call letters\u2014and historically as a call signal\u2014or abbreviated as a call) is a unique designation for a transmitter station. In the United States of America, they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters. A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency, informally adopted by individuals or organizations, or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station's identity.\n The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system. Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations, there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram. In order to save time, two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose. This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea. These were not globally unique, so a one-letter company identifier (for instance, 'M' and two letters as a Marconi station) was later added. By 1912, the need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple nations required an international standard; an ITU prefix would be used to identify a country, and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that country.",
  "/wiki/Effective_radiated_power": "Effective radiated power (ERP), synonymous with equivalent radiated power,  is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency (RF) power, such as that emitted by a radio transmitter.  It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam (main lobe).  ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.   It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna.  It is used in electronics and telecommunications, particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area.\n An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is equivalent (sometimes \"effective\") isotropically radiated power (EIRP).  Equivalent isotropically radiated power is the hypothetical power that would have to be radiated by an isotropic antenna to give the same (\"equivalent\") signal strength as the actual source antenna in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam. The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna, while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna.  Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64 (or 2.15 dB) compared to an isotropic radiator, if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",
  "/wiki/Height_above_average_terrain": "Height above average terrain (HAAT), or (less popularly) effective height above average terrain (EHAAT), is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico  have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this).\n The FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 miles (16\u00a0km) radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions\u2014it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example).\n The FCC has divided the Contiguous United States into three zones for the determination of spacing between FM and TV stations using the same frequencies. FM and TV stations are assigned maximum ERP and HAAT values, depending on their assigned zones, to prevent co-channel interference.",
  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre (Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling) or meter (American spelling) (from the French unit m\u00e8tre, from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd, \"measure\") is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.\n The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle, so the Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000\u00a0km. In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.",
  "/wiki/Foot_(unit)": "The foot (pl.\u00a0feet; abbreviation:\u00a0ft; symbol:\u00a0\u2032, the prime symbol) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959, one foot is defined as 0.3048\u00a0meter exactly. In customary and imperial units, the foot comprises 12\u00a0inches and three feet compose a yard.\n Historically the \"foot\" was a part of many local systems of units, including the Greek, Roman, Chinese, French, and English systems. It varied in length from country to country, from city to city, and sometimes from trade to trade. Its length was usually between 250\u00a0mm and 335\u00a0mm and was generally, but not always, subdivided into 12\u00a0inches or 16\u00a0digits.\n The United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot (a customary unit of length) in preference to the meter in its commercial, engineering, and standards activities. The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom; road signs must use imperial units (however, distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards, not feet), while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height. The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement. The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world.\n The length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 (UK), 14 (US male), 15.5 (US female) or 47 (EU sizing).",

  "/wiki/WSVH": "WSVH FM 91.1 is a 96,000-watt public radio station broadcasting from Savannah, Georgia, and transmitting from the WVAN-TV 9 (GPB TV) tower to the west in Pembroke, Georgia, north of Fort Stewart.  It serves the upper Georgia coast and areas well inland, and adjacent areas of far southern South Carolina.\n The station's signal is simulcast by GPB-owned WWIO-FM 88.9 in Brunswick, Georgia.  Together, the two stations serve the entire Georgia coastline.  Their signals can be heard from Beaufort, South Carolina to Fernandina Beach, Florida.\n The station group is an affiliate of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting radio network.  WSVH is one of two member stations of the GPB Radio network to have local announcers and underwriting during the day.  WSVH produces four radio programs for the GPB network: Celtic program The Green Island Radio Show with Harry O'Donoghue, folk show Music Americana with Russell Wells, \"Classical Tonight\", also hosted by Russell Wells, and the overnight classical block Coastal Nocturne.\n The station began broadcasting on April 20, 1981, with the first song played on the station at 6 a.m. being Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man. The station was independently operated until 1988 when it joined the statewide public radio network, then named \"Peach State Public Radio\". In the early 1990s, the listening area was greatly improved with the addition of WWIO in extreme southeast Georgia; an overnight classical music format was also added.  In 1997, the station moved its studio from downtown Savannah to the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography on Skidaway Island, just south of Savannah.  In August 2011, the WSVH/WWIO studios moved again to space at the Armstrong Center of Armstrong State University.\n The station airs mostly classical music, jazz and news from National Public Radio.  This programming is in contrast to SCETV-owned WJWJ-FM 89.9, a Beaufort, South Carolina-based NPR station that is primarily news and talk-formatted.\n When the PBS Descriptive Video Service is not running, viewers on DirecTV hear the programming and hourly station IDs of WSVH/WWIO when listening to the second audio program (\"Spanish\" selected with green button) of GPB on the standard-definition feed.  This is regardless of the location in the state, as it is a single feed for all media markets statewide.",
