It was promoted into the Finnish premier division (Veikkausliiga), for the first time in its history, at the end of the 2005 season. The club's manager is Vesa Vasara and it plays its home matches at Tapiolan urheilupuisto. It was founded in 1957 as Tapion Honka, and changed its name to FC Honka in 1975.\n FC Honka is largely renowned in Finland for its extensive youth scheme with over 1000 youth players playing in various age groups. It also has women's football team in the Naisten Liiga.\n Until 2005 FC Honka was thought of as a \"nearly, but not quite\" team, always underachieving in the Finnish First Division (Ykk\u00f6nen). In the late 1990s the objective was promotion but year after year they failed. In the beginning of the 21st century FC Honka almost went bankrupt but was saved at the last moment.\nIn early 2005 the club was taken over by Jouko Pakarinen and Jouko Harjunp\u00e4\u00e4, who had a plan to turn FC Honka from underachievers to a UEFA Champions League candidate.\n In the first year of their take-over of FC Honka, the management succeeded in assembling a squad which won the First Division (Ykk\u00f6nen) with ease and also made the semi-finals of the Finnish Cup where they eventually lost 1\u20130 to FC Haka.\n FC Honka was able to fight for top positions instantly, but narrowly missed the top three in their first two seasons. However, in 2007 team lost the Finnish Cup final to Tampere United on penalties. As Tampere United also won the league title, FC Honka qualified for the 2008\u201309 UEFA Cup. In 2008, FC Honka achieved its first medal by finishing 2nd in the league.\n FC Honka won the Finnish Cup in 2012. Due to financial difficulties the team was relegated to the third tier Kakkonen in 2015. In 2015 the fitness center company Esport bought the club and after that, the club has also been known as Esport Honka. The club dominated their first season in Kakkonen in 2015 and lost only two games, but were defeated in the promotion battle. After the 2016 season, the team was promoted to the second tier Finnish First Division (Ykk\u00f6nen). After the 2017 Ykk\u00f6nen season Honka was promoted to the highest Finnish tier Veikkausliiga after Promotion playoffs against HIFK.\n In Veikkausliiga the team is also known as Esport Honka, the other teams only use the name FC Honka.",
