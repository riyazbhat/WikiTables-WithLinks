The club's greatest season was 1966\u201367, when Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup, also winning the Scottish league championship, the Scottish Cup, the League Cup and the Glasgow Cup. Celtic also reached the 1970 European Cup Final and the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, losing in both.\n Celtic have a long-standing fierce rivalry with Rangers, and the clubs are known as the Old Firm, seen by some as the world's biggest football derby. The club's fanbase was estimated in 2003 as being around nine million worldwide, and there are more than 160 Celtic supporters clubs in over 20 countries. An estimated 80,000 fans travelled to Seville for the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, and their \"extraordinarily loyal and sporting behaviour\" in spite of defeat earned the club Fair Play awards from both UEFA and FIFA. FIFA president Sepp Blatter described Celtic fans as being \"the greatest in the world\".",
