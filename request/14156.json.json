Thirdly, chapels are small places of worship, built as satellite sites by a church or monastery, for example in remote areas; these are often called a chapel of ease.  A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel.  Finally, for historical reasons, chapel is also often the term used for independent or nonconformist places of worship in Great Britain\u2014outside the established church, even where in practice they operate as a parish church.",

The capital may be convex, as in the Doric order; concave, as in the inverted bell of the Corinthian order; or scrolling out, as in the Ionic order.
