  "/wiki/Autonomy_(software)": "HP Autonomy, previously Autonomy Corporation PLC, is a multinational enterprise software company founded in Cambridge, United Kingdom in 1996. Originally, Autonomy specialised in analysis of large scale unstructured \"big data\", becoming the UK's largest and most successful software business by 2010. It used a combination of technologies born out of research at the University of Cambridge and developed a variety of enterprise search and knowledge management applications using adaptive pattern recognition techniques centered on Bayesian inference in conjunction with traditional methods. It maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach, and controls described as a \"rod of iron\", which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest 5% of its sales force each quarter, while cosseting the best sales staff \"like rock stars\". Autonomy was acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in October 2011. The deal valued Autonomy at $11.7 billion (\u00a37.4 billion) with a premium of around 79% over market price that was widely criticized as \"absurdly high\", a \"botched strategy shift\" and a \"chaotic\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings by expanding the high-margin software services sector. Within a year, major culture clashes became apparent and HP had written off $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value. HP claims this resulted from \"accounting improprieties, misrepresentations and disclosure failures\" by the previous management.",

In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).\n Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the \"Unix philosophy\": the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited, well-defined function, with a unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) as the main means of communication, and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.
