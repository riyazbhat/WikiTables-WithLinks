  "/wiki/Star_designation": "In astronomy, stars have a variety of different stellar designations and names, including catalogue designations, current and historical proper names, and foreign language names.",
  "/wiki/Apparent_magnitude": "Apparent magnitude (m)  is the brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from the Earth. An object's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic luminosity, its distance from Earth, and any extinction of the object's light by interstellar dust along the line of sight to the observer.",
  "/wiki/Stellar_classification": "In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. Electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines. Each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule, with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element. The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere, although in some cases there are true abundance differences. The spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature.",
  "/wiki/Alcyone_(star)": "Alcyone /\u00e6l\u02c8sa\u026a\u0259ni\u02d0/, designated \u03b7 Tauri (Eta Tauri, abbreviated Eta Tau, \u03b7 Tau), is a multiple star system in the constellation of Taurus. Approximately 440 light years from the Sun, it is the brightest star in the Pleiades open cluster, which is a young cluster, around 100 million years old. There are a number of fainter stars very close to Alcyone, all likely members of the same cluster.",
  "/wiki/Atlas_(star)": "Atlas /\u02c8\u00e6tl\u0259s/, designation 27 Tauri, is a triple star system in the constellation of Taurus. It is a member of the Pleiades, an open star cluster (M45). It is 431 light-years (132 parsecs) away, and is 3.92 degrees north of the ecliptic.",
  "/wiki/Electra_(star)": "Electra /\u026a\u02c8l\u025bktr\u0259/, designated 17 Tauri, is a blue-white giant star in the constellation of Taurus. It is the third-brightest star in the Pleiades open star cluster (M45); the most visible stars in this group are named for the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology.",
  "/wiki/Maia_(star)": "Maia /\u02c8me\u026a\u0259/, designated 20 Tauri  (abbreviated 20 Tau), is a star in the constellation of Taurus.  It is the fourth-brightest star in the Pleiades open star cluster (M45), after Alcyone, Atlas and Electra, in that order. Maia is a blue giant of spectral type B8 III, and a mercury-manganese star.",
  "/wiki/Merope_(star)": "Merope /\u02c8m\u025br\u0259pi\u02d0/, designated 23\u00a0Tauri (abbreviated 23 Tau), is a star in the constellation of Taurus and a member of the Pleiades star cluster. It is approximately 380 light years away.",
  "/wiki/Taygeta_(star)": "19 Tauri is a double star in the constellation of Taurus and a member of the Pleiades open star cluster (M45).",
  "/wiki/Pleione_(star)": "Pleione (pronounced /\u02c8pla\u026a\u0259ni\u02d0/ or /\u02c8pli\u02d0\u0259ni\u02d0/) is a binary star and the seventh-brightest star in the Pleiades star cluster (Messier 45). It has the variable star designation BU Tauri (BU Tau) and the Flamsteed designation 28 Tauri (28 Tau). The star is located approximately 120 parsecs (390 light-years) from the Sun, appearing in the constellation of Taurus. Pleione is located close on the sky to the brighter star Atlas, so is difficult for stargazers to distinguish with the naked eye despite being a fifth magnitude star.",
  "/wiki/Variable_star": "A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth (its apparent magnitude) fluctuates.",
  "/wiki/Celaeno_(star)": "Celaeno /s\u026a\u02c8li\u02d0no\u028a/, designated 16 Tauri, is a star in the constellation of Taurus and a member of the Pleiades open star cluster (M45) of stars.",

Its components have the Flamsteed designations 21 Tauri and 22 Tauri, and are sometimes known as Sterope I and Sterope II, respectively.",
  "/wiki/18_Tauri": "18 Tauri is a single star in the zodiac constellation of Taurus, located 444\u00a0light years away from the Sun. It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, blue-white hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.66. The star is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +4.8. It is a member of the Pleiades open cluster, which is positioned near the ecliptic and thus is subject to lunar occultations.",
  "/wiki/Pleiades": "The Pleiades (/\u02c8pla\u026a.\u0259di\u02d0z, \u02c8pli\u02d0\u0259-/), also known as the Seven Sisters and Messier 45, are an open star cluster containing middle-aged, hot B-type stars located in the constellation of Taurus. It is among the star clusters nearest Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky."
