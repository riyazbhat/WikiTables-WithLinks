  "/wiki/Districts_of_Bhutan": "The Kingdom of Bhutan is divided into 20 districts (Dzongkha: dzongkhags). Bhutan is located between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and India on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas in South Asia.\nDzongkhags are the primary subdivisions of Bhutan.  They possess a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of Bhutan, such as regulating commerce, running elections, and creating local governments. The Local Government Act of 2009 established local governments in each of the 20 dzongkhags overseen by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs. Each dzongkhag has its own elected government with non-legislative executive powers, called a dzongkhag tshogdu (district council). The dzongkhag tshogdu is assisted by the dzongkhag administration headed by a dzongkdag (royal appointees who are the chief executive officer of each dzongkhag). Each dzongkhag also has a dzongkhag court presided over by a dzongkhag drangpon (judge), who is appointed by the Chief Justice of Bhutan on the advice of Royal Judicial Service Council. The dzongkhags, and their residents, are represented in the Parliament of Bhutan, a bicameral legislature consisting of the National Council and the National Assembly. Each dzongkhag has one National Council representative. National Assembly representatives are distributed among the dzongkhags in proportion to their registered voter population as recommended by the Delimitation Commission, provided that \"no dzongkhag shall have less than two and more than seven National Assembly constituencies.\"\n As of the 2017 census, Thimphu is the most populous dzongkhag, with 138,736 residents; Gasa is the least populous with 3,952 residents.  Thimphu is the most densely populated with 67.1 people per km2 whereas Gasa is the least densely populated with 1.3 people per km2. The largest dzongkhag by land area is Wangdue Phodrang encompassing 4,308 km2, while the smallest is Tsirang, encompassing 639 km2.",
  "/wiki/Gewog": "A gewog (Dzongkha: \u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f42 geok, block), in the past also spelled as geog, refers to a group of villages in Bhutan. The head of a gewog is called a gup (\u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0b gepo). Gewogs form a geographic administrative unit below dzongkhag districts (and dungkhag subdistricts, where they exist), and above Dzongkhag Thromde class B and Yenlag Thromde municipalities. Dzongkhag Thromde class A municipalities have their own independent local government body.\n Bhutan comprises 205 gewogs, which average 230 km\u00b2 in area. The gewogs in turn are divided into chewogs for elections and thromdes \"municipalities\" for administration. The Parliament of Bhutan passed legislation in 2002 and 2007 on the status, structure, and leadership of local governments, including gewogs. The most recent legislation by parliament regarding gewogs is the Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009. In July 2011, the government slated 11 gewogs across Bhutan for reorganization, including both mergers and bifurcations, to be debated in dzongkhag local governments. These changes are contemplated to promote ease of travel to gewog capitals and to equitably allocate development resources.",
  "/wiki/Gasa_District": "Gasa District or Gasa Dzongkhag (Dzongkha: \u0f58\u0f42\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0fab\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f42\u0f0b; Wylie: Mgar-sa rdzong-khag) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. The capital of Gasa District is Gasa Dzong near Gasa. It is located in the far north of the county and spans the Middle and High regions of the Tibetan Himalayas. The dominant language of the district is Dzongkha, which is the national language. Related languages, Layakha and Lunanakha, are spoken by semi-nomadic communities in the north of the district. The People's Republic of China claims the northern part of Gasa District.\n Gasa has an area of 3,117.74 km2 (1,203.77 sq mi) as of 2010[update],\nformerly 4,409.30 km2 (1,702.44 sq mi) as of 2002[update]. It had a population of 3,116 as of the 2005 census, making it the largest, least populated, and thus least densely populated of all the dzongkhags; it is also the least developed.",
  "/wiki/Lunana_Gewog": "Lunana Gewog is a gewog (village block) of Gasa District, Bhutan. The village Lunana is the administrative center of Lunana Gewog. \n The gewog lies almost entirely within protected areas, mostly in Jigme Dorji National Park, though eastern sections are part of Wangchuck Centennial Park. Lunana contains many of Bhutan's glaciers.\n In addition to the national language, Dzongkha, many locals speak Lunanakha.\n The closure of the Tibetan border following the Chinese invasion of Tibet brought changes to neighboring areas, as refugees from Tibet arrived with their yaks, which they sold off at low prices. However, because there were no direct routes into Lunana from Tibet, yaks were brought into Lunana from Laya and Sephu in Wangdue Phodrang District. Taxes on horses and yaks, which had been a disincentive to livestock production were reduced, and yak production increased.",
  "/wiki/Laya_Gewog": "Laya Gewog is a gewog (village block) of Gasa District, Bhutan. The capital of gewog is the town Laya. \n The gewog lies entirely within Jigme Dorji National Park and contains several of Bhutan's glaciers.\n As well as the national language, Dzongkha, many locals speak Layakha.\n The closure of the Tibetan border following the Chinese invasion of Tibet brought several changes to the area. Local people were no longer compelled to work as porters for Tibetan and Bhutanese officials, nobles, or religious figures from Gasa Dzong. Refugees from Tibet arrived with their yaks, which they sold off at low prices. Taxes on horses and yaks, which had been a disincentive to livestock production were reduced, and yak production increased.",
  "/wiki/Mo_Chhu": "Mo Chhu is a major river in Bhutan. The word \"Chhu\" means \"river\" or \"water\" in Dzongkha, the official national language in Bhutan. The river rises in Gasa Dzongkhag (district) near the border between Bhutan and Tibet. From there, the Mo Chhu flows generally southward to Punakha in central Bhutan, where it joins the Pho Chhu from the northeast. The confluence of the two streams is immediately below the Punakha Dzong, which is the winter home of the Dratshang Lhentshog (Central Monk Body) and the Je Khenpo.\nThe combined streams are then joined by the Dang Chhu near the town of Wangdue Phodrang, and the name of the river becomes the Puna Tsang Chhu. The river then flows through Dagana and Tsirang Districts. After leaving Bhutan near the town of Kalikhola, the river enters Assam in India and is known as the Sankosh. The Sankosh ultimately empties into the Brahmaputra.",
  "/wiki/Punakha_Dzong": "The Punakha Dzong, also known as Pungthang Dewa chhenbi Phodrang (meaning \"the palace of great happiness or bliss\"), is the administrative centre of Punakha District in Punakha, Bhutan. Constructed by Ngawang Namgyal, 1st Zhabdrung Rinpoche, in 1637\u201338, it is the second oldest and second largest dzong in Bhutan and one of its most majestic structures. The dzong houses the sacred relics of the southern Drukpa Lineage of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, including the Rangjung Kharsapani and the sacred remains of Ngawang Namgyal and the tert\u00f6n Pema Lingpa.\n Punakha Dzong was the administrative centre and the seat of the Government of Bhutan until 1955, when the capital was moved to Thimphu. It is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion.",
  "/wiki/Bumthang_District": "Bumthang District (Dzongkha: \u0f56\u0f74\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f50\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f62\u0fab\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f42\u0f0b; Wylie: Bum-thang rzong-khag) is one of the 20 dzongkhag (districts) comprising Bhutan. It is the most historic dzongkhag if the number of ancient temples and sacred sites is counted. Bumthang consists of the four mountain valleys of Ura, Chumey, Tang and Choekhor (\"Bumthang\"), although occasionally the entire district is referred to as Bumthang valley.\n Bumthang directly translates as \"beautiful field\" \u2013 thang means field or flat place, and bum is said be an abbreviation of either bumpa (a vessel for holy water, thus describing the shape and nature of the valley), or simply bum (\"girl,\" indicating this is the valley of beautiful girls). The name is said to have arisen after construction of Jambay Lhakhang.",
  "/wiki/Lakes_of_Bhutan": "The lakes of Bhutan comprise its glacial lakes and its natural mountain lakes. Bhutanese territory contains some 2,674 high altitude glacial lakes and subsidiary lakes, out of which 25 pose a risk of GLOFs. There are also more than 59 natural non-glacial lakes in Bhutan, covering about 4,250 hectares (16.4 sq mi). Most are located above an altitude of 3,500 metres (11,500 ft), and most have no permanent human settlements nearby, though many are used for grazing yaks and may have scattered temporary settlements.\n Only four lakes are below an altitude of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft): the temperate Ho Ko Tsho in Punakha District at 1,829 metres (6,001 ft); Luchika in Wangdue Phodrang at 1,830 metres (6,000 ft); Buli in Zhemgang at 1,372 metres (4,501 ft); and the subtropical Gulandi in Samdrup Jongkhar at 366 metres (1,201 ft).\n As phenomena of nature, all lakes in Bhutan are believed to be inhabited by spirits.:27 A handful of lakes in Bhutan are particularly sacred, most often connected to lives of Buddhist saints Guru Rimpoche and Pema Lingpa. For example, Membar Tsho (\"Burning Lake\"), in the Tang Valley near Bumthang, is heavily associated with Guru Rimpoche, who brought Buddhism to Bhutan and discovered his first terma in the lake in 1475.:21, 29, 177\n Most natural lake names are denoted with the word tsho, meaning \"lake\" (Dzongkha: \u0f58\u0f5a\u0f7c\u0f0b; Wylie: mtsho). They may be identified as an individuals, pairs, or groups of lakes."
