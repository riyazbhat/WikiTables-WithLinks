  "/wiki/Districts_of_Bhutan": "The Kingdom of Bhutan is divided into 20 districts (Dzongkha: dzongkhags). Bhutan is located between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and India on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas in South Asia. Dzongkhags are the primary subdivisions of Bhutan. They possess a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of Bhutan, such as regulating commerce, running elections, and creating local governments. The Local Government Act of 2009 established local governments in each of the 20 dzongkhags overseen by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs. Each dzongkhag has its own elected government with non-legislative executive powers, called a dzongkhag tshogdu (district council). The dzongkhag tshogdu is assisted by the dzongkhag administration headed by a dzongkdag (royal appointees who are the chief executive officer of each dzongkhag). Each dzongkhag also has a dzongkhag court presided over by a dzongkhag drangpon (judge), who is appointed by the Chief Justice of Bhutan on the advice of Royal Judicial Service Council.",
  "/wiki/Gewog": "A gewog (Dzongkha: \u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f42 geok, block), in the past also spelled as geog, refers to a group of villages in Bhutan. The head of a gewog is called a gup (\u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0b gepo). Gewogs form a geographic administrative unit below dzongkhag districts (and dungkhag subdistricts, where they exist), and above Dzongkhag Thromde class B and Yenlag Thromde municipalities. Dzongkhag Thromde class A municipalities have their own independent local government body. Bhutan comprises 205 gewogs, which average 230 km\u00b2 in area. The gewogs in turn are divided into chewogs for elections and thromdes municipalities for administration. The Parliament of Bhutan passed legislation in 2002 and 2007 on the status, structure, and leadership of local governments, including gewogs. The most recent legislation by parliament regarding gewogs is the Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009.",
  "/wiki/Gasa_District": "Gasa District or Gasa Dzongkhag (Dzongkha: \u0f58\u0f42\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0fab\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f42\u0f0b; Wylie: Mgar-sa rdzong-khag) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. The capital of Gasa District is Gasa Dzong near Gasa. It is located in the far north of the county and spans the Middle and High regions of the Tibetan Himalayas. The dominant language of the district is Dzongkha, which is the national language. Related languages, Layakha and Lunanakha, are spoken by semi-nomadic communities in the north of the district. The People's Republic of China claims the northern part of Gasa District. Gasa has an area of 3,117.74 km2 (1,203.77 sq mi) as of 2010[update],\nformerly 4,409.30 km2 (1,702.44 sq mi) as of 2002[update]. It had a population of 3,116 as of the 2005 census, making it the largest, least populated, and thus least densely populated of all the dzongkhags; it is also the least developed.",
  "/wiki/Lunana_Gewog": "Lunana Gewog is a gewog (village block) of Gasa District, Bhutan. The village Lunana is the administrative center of Lunana Gewog. The gewog lies almost entirely within protected areas, mostly in Jigme Dorji National Park, though eastern sections are part of Wangchuck Centennial Park. Lunana contains many of Bhutan's glaciers. In addition to the national language, Dzongkha, many locals speak Lunanakha. The closure of the Tibetan border following the Chinese invasion of Tibet brought changes to neighboring areas, as refugees from Tibet arrived with their yaks, which they sold off at low prices. However, because there were no direct routes into Lunana from Tibet, yaks were brought into Lunana from Laya and Sephu in Wangdue Phodrang District. Taxes on horses and yaks, which had been a disincentive to livestock production were reduced, and yak production increased.",
  "/wiki/Laya_Gewog": "Laya Gewog is a gewog (village block) of Gasa District, Bhutan. The capital of gewog is the town Laya. The gewog lies entirely within Jigme Dorji National Park and contains several of Bhutan's glaciers. As well as the national language, Dzongkha, many locals speak Layakha. The closure of the Tibetan border following the Chinese invasion of Tibet brought several changes to the area. Local people were no longer compelled to work as porters for Tibetan and Bhutanese officials, nobles, or religious figures from Gasa Dzong. Refugees from Tibet arrived with their yaks, which they sold off at low prices. Taxes on horses and yaks, which had been a disincentive to livestock production were reduced, and yak production increased.",
  "/wiki/Mo_Chhu": "Mo Chhu is a major river in Bhutan. The word Chhu means river or water in Dzongkha, the official national language in Bhutan. The river rises in Gasa Dzongkhag (district) near the border between Bhutan and Tibet. From there, the Mo Chhu flows generally southward to Punakha in central Bhutan, where it joins the Pho Chhu from the northeast. The confluence of the two streams is immediately below the Punakha Dzong, which is the winter home of the Dratshang Lhentshog (Central Monk Body) and the Je Khenpo. The combined streams are then joined by the Dang Chhu near the town of Wangdue Phodrang, and the name of the river becomes the Puna Tsang Chhu. The river then flows through Dagana and Tsirang Districts. After leaving Bhutan near the town of Kalikhola, the river enters Assam in India and is known as the Sankosh.",

Bumthang directly translates as beautiful field \u2013 thang means field or flat place, and bum is said be an abbreviation of either bumpa (a vessel for holy water, thus describing the shape and nature of the valley), or simply bum (girl, indicating this is the valley of beautiful girls). The name is said to have arisen after construction of Jambay Lhakhang."
