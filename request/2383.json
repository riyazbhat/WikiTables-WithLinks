  "/wiki/Communes_of_France": "The commune (French pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[k\u0254myn]) is a level of administrative division in the French Republic. French communes are analogous to civil townships and incorporated municipalities in the United States and Canada, Gemeinden in Germany, comuni in Italy or ayuntamiento in Spain. The United Kingdom has no exact equivalent, as communes resemble districts in urban areas, but are closer to parishes in rural areas where districts are much larger. Communes are based on historical geographic communities or villages and are vested with significant powers to manage the populations and land of the geographic area covered.  The communes are the fourth-level administrative divisions of France.\n Communes vary widely in size and area, from large sprawling cities with millions of inhabitants like Paris, to small hamlets with only a handful of inhabitants. Communes typically are based on pre-existing villages and facilitate local governance. All communes have names, but not all named geographic areas or groups of people residing together are communes (\"lieu dit\" or \"bourg\"), the difference residing in the lack of administrative powers. Except for the municipal arrondissements of its largest cities, the communes are the lowest level of administrative division in France and are governed by elected officials (mayor and a \"conseil municipal\") with extensive autonomous powers to implement national policy.",
  "/wiki/Departments_of_France": "In the administrative divisions of France, the department (French: d\u00e9partement, pronounced\u00a0[depa\u0281t(\u0259)m\u0251\u0303]) is one of the three levels of government below the national level (\"territorial collectivities\"), between the administrative regions and the commune. Ninety-five departments are in metropolitan France, and five are overseas departments, which are also classified as regions. Departments are further subdivided into 334 arrondissements, themselves divided into cantons; the last two have no autonomy, and are used for the organisation of police, fire departments, and sometimes, elections.\n Each department is administered by an elected body called a departmental council (conseil d\u00e9partemental [sing.], conseils d\u00e9partementaux [plur.]). From 1800 to April 2015, these were called general councils (conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sing. conseils g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [plur.]). Each council has a president. Their main areas of responsibility include the management of a number of social and welfare allowances, of junior high school (coll\u00e8ge) buildings and technical staff, and  local roads and school and rural buses, and a contribution to municipal infrastructures. Local services of the state administration are traditionally organised at departmental level, where the prefect represents the government; however, regions have gained importance in this regard since the 2000s, with some department-level services merged into region-level services.\n The departments were created in 1790 as a rational replacement of Ancien R\u00e9gime provinces with a view to strengthen national unity; the title \"department\" is used to mean a part of a larger whole. Almost all of them were named after physical geographical features (rivers, mountains, or coasts), rather than after historical or cultural territories which could have their own loyalties. The division of France into departments was a project particularly identified with the French revolutionary leader the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s, although it had already been frequently discussed and written about by many politicians and thinkers. The earliest known suggestion of it is from 1764 in the writings of d'Argenson. They have inspired similar divisions in many countries, some of them former French colonies.\n Most French departments are assigned a two-digit number, the \"Official Geographical Code\", allocated by the Institut national de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques. Overseas departments have a three-digit number. The number is used, for example, in the postal code, and was until recently used for all vehicle registration plates. While residents commonly use the numbers to refer to their own department or a neighbouring one, more distant departments are generally referred to by their names, as few people know the numbers of all the departments. For example, inhabitants of Loiret might refer to their department as \"the 45\".\n In 2014, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande proposed to abolish departmental councils by 2020, which would have maintained the departments as administrative divisions, and to transfer their powers to other levels of governance. This reform project has since been abandoned.",
  "/wiki/Regions_of_France": "France is divided into 18 administrative regions (French: r\u00e9gions, singular r\u00e9gion [\u0281e\u0292j\u0254\u0303]), of which 13 are located in metropolitan France (i.e. on the European continent), while the other five are overseas regions (not be confused with the \"overseas collectivities\", which have a semi-autonomous status). \n All 13 mainland administrative regions (including Corsica as of 2019[update]) are further subdivided into 2 to 13 administrative departments, with the prefect of each region's administrative center's department also acting as the regional prefect. The overseas regions administratively consist of only one department each and hence also have the status of \"overseas departments\".\n Most administrative regions also have the status of regional \"territorial collectivities\", which comes with a local government, with departmental and communal collectivities below the region level. The exceptions are Corsica, the French Guiana, Mayotte, and Martinique, where region and department functions are managed by single local governments having consolidated jurisdiction, and which are known as \"single territorial collectivities\".",

The area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory. Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For centuries it was a dominion of Savoy, and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia until its re-annexation by France in 1860.\n The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. The city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais (\"Walkway of the English\") owes its name to visitors to the resort.\nThe clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Arman.

It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the  18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy.\n In 2012, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the fourth-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with 3,366 hectares (8,320 acres) of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.",

Located in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, Grenoble is the capital of the department of Is\u00e8re and is an important European scientific centre. The city advertises itself as the \"Capital of the Alps\", due to its size and its proximity to the mountains.\n Grenoble's history goes back over 2,000 years, to a time when it was a small Gallic village. It became the capital of the Dauphin\u00e9 in the 11th century.\n Industrial development increased the prominence of Grenoble through several periods of economic expansion over the last three centuries. This started with a booming glove industry in the 18th and 19th centuries, continued with the development of a strong hydropower industry in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, and ended with a post-World War\u00a0II economic boom symbolized by the holding of the X\u00a0Olympic Winter Games in 1968. The city has grown to be one of Europe's most important research, technology, and innovation centers, with each fifth inhabitant working directly in these domains.\n The population of the city (commune) of Grenoble was 158,180 at the 2016 census, while the population of the Grenoble metropolitan area (French: aire urbaine de Grenoble or \"agglom\u00e9ration grenobloise\") was 687,985.

It was the cradle of the Plantagenet dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of Ren\u00e9 of Anjou. Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the Mayenne, the Sarthe, and the Loir, all coming from the north and flowing south to the Loire. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the Maine, a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south.
