All of the district's sites are shell middens along the banks of the Green River that date from the later portion of the Archaic period. Studies of this assemblage of sites were critical in the development of knowledge of the Archaic period in the eastern United States. Kentucky's Green River runs through a broad alluvial plain, from which outcroppings of  bedrock project. The plain is an area that was inundated during the Pleistocene by a water body dubbed Lake Green, which resulted in the deposition of large amounts of silt. The middens of this district are typically located along the prehistoric routes of waterways that were established after Lake Green was drained.
