Fossil remains indicate that A. africanus was significantly more like modern humans than A. afarensis, with a more human-like cranium permitting a larger brain and more humanoid facial features. A. africanus has been found only in southern Africa at four sites: Taung (1924), Sterkfontein (1935), Makapansgat (1948) and Gladysvale (1992).\n In January 2019, scientists reported that Australopithecus sediba is distinct from, but shares anatomical similarities to, both the older Australopithecus africanus, and the younger Homo habilis.",

(2002), Corresponding Member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences (2009), since 2004 General Director of the Georgian National Museum (GNM). He is a son of the archaeologist Otar Lordkipanidze. David Lordkipanidze is best known for his discovery of the hominin fossil, first named Homo georgicus, but later reclassified as Homo erectus. Conducting excavation at Dmanisi in Georgia, he found skulls of an early hominin thought to be a precursor of Homo erectus. Subsequently, four fossil skeletons were found, showing a species still with primitive features in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They represent a stage soon after the transition from Homo habilis to Homo erectus, and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. Lordkipanidze has received many awards, including the Georgia's Order of Honour (2000), Award of the Prince of Monaco (2001), the French Order of Palmes Academiques (2002), the Rolex Award for Enterprise (2004), the French Order of Honour (2006) and the Goethe Medal (2016).",
  "/wiki/Dmanisi_skull_4": "The Dmanisi skulls are a set of hominin fossils (five crania and four mandibles) from the archaeological site near Dmanisi, Georgia. They were discovered in excavations at the site between 1991 and 2005. Dated to approximately 1.85-1.75 Ma, these fossils may morphologically represent the populations of hominins that initially emigrated out of Africa. Their small brain size, primitive skeletal architecture, and range of variation has been a point of debate for their taxonomic status. The fossil hominins have been described as exhibiting similarity to Homo ergaster, Homo georgicus, and are classified as either Homo georgicus, or as a subspecies of Homo erectus, Homo erectus georgicus.\n The large range of variation between the five individuals is striking due to their geographical and temporal proximity with one another. The large degree of variation present in these specimens calls into question whether or not the morphological differences between H. erectus, H. ergaster, and H. rudolfensis are due to in-species variation as well. Regardless of their taxonomic position, the spatio-temporal proximity of these five individuals provide evidence for large variation in morphology within early Homo populations.",
  "/wiki/Dmanisi_skull": "The Dmanisi skull, also known as Skull 5 or D4500, is one of five  skulls discovered in Dmanisi, Georgia and classified as early Homo erectus. Described in a publication in October 2013, it is estimated to be about 1.8 million years old and is the most complete skull of a Pleistocene Homo species, and the first complete adult hominin skull of that degree of antiquity. According to researchers, the discovery provides the first evidence that early Homo comprised adult individuals with small brains but body mass, stature and limb proportions reaching the lower range limit of modern variation.\n The skull has been the cause of a paleontological controversy that is still ongoing as of 2017: many hominin fossils thought to be from different species such as Homo rudolfensis or Homo habilis may not have been separate species at all. Rather, they may have been a single evolving lineage.",

  "/wiki/OH_5": "OH 5 (Olduvai Hominid number 5, also known as Zinjanthropus or Nutcracker Man; colloquially as Dear Boy) is a fossilized cranium and the holotype of the species Paranthropus boisei. It was discovered in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, by archaeologist-paleontologist Mary Leakey in 1959. Her husband and fellow scientist Louis Leakey initially classified the hominid as Zinjanthropus boisei and thought that it was an early ancestor of modern humans that lived approximately 2 million years ago.  However, this contention was later withdrawn because of its robust australopithecine features and the discovery of Homo habilis soon thereafter.",

She also discovered the robust Zinjanthropus skull at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, eastern Africa. For much of her career she worked with her husband, Louis Leakey, at Olduvai Gorge, where they uncovered fossils of ancient hominines and the earliest hominins, as well as the stone tools produced by the latter group. Mary Leakey developed a system for classifying the stone tools found at Olduvai. She discovered the Laetoli footprints, and at the Laetoli site she discovered hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million years old. During her career, Leakey discovered fifteen new species of animal. She also brought about the naming of a new genus. In 1972, after the death of her husband, Leakey became director of excavations at Olduvai.",
  "/wiki/OH_7": "OH 7 (Olduvai Hominid \u2116 7), also nicknamed Johnny's Child, is the type specimen of Homo habilis. The fossils were discovered on November 4, 1960 in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, by Jonathan and Mary Leakey. The remains are dated to approximately 1.75 million years, and consist of fragmented parts of a lower mandible (which still holds thirteen teeth, as well as unerupted wisdom teeth), an isolated maxillary molar, two parietal bones, and twenty-one finger, hand, and wrist bones. The OH 7 hand is wide, with a large thumb and broad fingertips, similar to that of humans; however, unlike in humans the fingers are relatively long and exhibit chimpanzee-like curvature. Furthermore, the thumb's orientation relative to the other fingers resembles the anatomy of great apes. The parietal bones \u2014 a nearly complete left parietal and fragmented right parietal \u2014 were used to deduce the cranial capacity of the hominid, which was placed at 663 cc in account of the fact that the fossils belonged to a 12- or 13-year-old male. This was extrapolated by Phillip Tobias to 674 cc for the hominid's full adult potential. However, other scientists have estimated the cranial capacity at 590 cc to 710 cc.",

  "/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils": "The following tables give an overview of notable finds of hominin fossils and remains relating to human evolution, beginning with the formation of the tribe Hominini (the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages) in the late Miocene, roughly 7 to 8 million years ago.\n As there are thousands of fossils, mostly fragmentary, often consisting of single bones or isolated teeth with complete skulls and skeletons rare, this overview is not complete, but does show some of the most important finds. The fossils are arranged by approximate age as determined by radiometric dating and/or incremental dating and the species name represents current consensus; if there is no clear scientific consensus the other possible classifications are indicated.\n Most of the early fossils shown are not considered direct ancestors to Homo sapiens but are closely related to direct ancestors and are therefore important to the study of the lineage. After 1.5 million years ago (extinction of Paranthropus), all fossils shown are human (genus Homo). After 11,500 years ago (11.5 ka, beginning of the Holocene), all fossils shown are Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans), illustrating recent divergence in the formation of modern human sub-populations."
