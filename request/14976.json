  "/wiki/Ajaeng": "The ajaeng is a Korean string instrument. It is a wide zither with strings made of twisted silk, played by means of a slender stick made of forsythia wood, which is scraped against the strings in the manner of a bow. The original version of the instrument, and that used in court music (called the jeongak ajaeng), has seven strings, while the ajaeng used for sanjo and sinawi (called the sanjo ajaeng) has eight strings; some instruments may have up to nine strings. The ajaeng is generally played while seated on the floor. It has a tone similar to that of a cello, but raspier. Some contemporary players prefer to use an actual horsehair bow rather than a stick, believing the sound to be smoother. The instrument is used in court, aristocratic, and folk music, as well as in contemporary classical music and film scores. The ajaeng is derived from the Chinese yazheng (simplified: \u8f67\u7b5d; traditional: \u8ecb\u7b8f).",
  "/wiki/Music_of_Korea": "The music of Korea refers to music from the Korean peninsula ranging from prehistoric times to the division of Korea into South and North in 1945. It includes court music, folk music, poetic songs, and religious music used in shamanistic and Buddhist traditions. Together, traditional Korean music is referred to as gugak (Hangul: \uad6d\uc545), which literally means national music.",

  "/wiki/Music_of_Vietnam": "Traditional Vietnamese music is highly diverse and syncretistic, combining native and foreign influences, and influences from Vietnam's ethnic minority groups. Throughout its history, Vietnam has been most heavily influenced by the Chinese musical tradition, as an integral part, along with Korea, Mongolia and Japan. The former Indochinese kingdom of Champa also exerted some influence (albeit more minor when compared to China) on Vietnam's traditional music.",
  "/wiki/Gayageum": "The gayageum or kayagum is a traditional Korean zither-like string instrument with 12 strings, though some more recent variants have 18 or 25 strings. It is probably the best known traditional Korean musical instrument. It is related to other Asian instruments, including the Chinese guzheng, Japanese koto, Mongolian yatga, Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n tranh, and Sundanese kacapi.

  "/wiki/Zither": "Zither (/\u02c8z\u026a\u00f0\u0259r, \u02c8z\u026a\u03b8-/; German: [\u02c8ts\u026at\u0250]) is a class of stringed instruments. The word Zither is a German rendering of the Greek word cithara, from which the modern word guitar also derives. Historically, it has been applied to any instrument of the cittern family, or to an instrument consisting of many strings stretched across a thin, flat body - similar to a psaltery. This article describes the latter variety. Zithers are played by strumming or plucking the strings, either with the fingers (sometimes using an accessory called a plectrum or pick), sounding the strings with a bow, or, with varieties of the instrument like the santur or cimbalom, by beating the strings with specially shaped hammers. Like a guitar or lute, a zither's body serves as a resonating chamber (sound box), but, unlike guitars and lutes, a zither lacks a distinctly separate neck assembly. The number of strings varies, from one to more than fifty. In modern common usage the term zither refers to three specific instruments: the concert zither (German: Konzertzither), its variant the Alpine zither (both using a fretted fingerboard), and the chord zither (more recently described as a fretless zither or guitar zither). Concert and Alpine zithers are traditionally found in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, France, north-western Croatia, the southern regions of Germany, alpine Europe, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Emigration from these areas during the 19th century introduced the concert and Alpine zither to North and South America. Chord zithers similar to the instrument in the photograph also became popular in North America during the late 19th and early 20th century. These variants all use metal strings, similar to the cittern.",
  "/wiki/String_instrument": "String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner. Musicians play some string instruments by plucking the strings with their fingers or a plectrum - and others by hitting the strings with a light wooden hammer or by rubbing the strings with a bow. In some keyboard instruments, such as the harpsichord, the musician presses a key that plucks the string. With bowed instruments, the player pulls a rosined horsehair bow across the strings, causing them to vibrate. With a hurdy-gurdy, the musician cranks a wheel whose rosined edge touches the strings. Bowed instruments include the string section instruments of the Classical music orchestra (violin, viola, cello and double bass) and a number of other instruments (e.g., viols and gambas used in early music from the Baroque music era and fiddles used in many types of folk music). All of the bowed string instruments can also be plucked with the fingers, a technique called pizzicato. A wide variety of techniques are used to sound notes on the electric guitar, including plucking with the fingernails or a plectrum, strumming and even tapping on the fingerboard and using feedback from a loud, distorted guitar amplifier to produce a sustained sound. Some types of string instrument are mainly plucked, such as the harp and the electric bass. In the Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification, used in organology, string instruments are called chordophones. Other examples include the sitar, rebab, banjo, mandolin, ukulele, and bouzouki. In most string instruments, the vibrations are transmitted to the body of the instrument, which often incorporates some sort of hollow or enclosed area.",
  "/wiki/Strings_(music)": "A string is the vibrating element that produces sound in string instruments such as the guitar, harp, piano (piano wire), and members of the violin family. Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a musical instrument holds under tension so that they can vibrate freely, but controllably. Strings may be plain, consisting only of a single material, like steel, nylon, or gut, or wound, having a core of one material and an overwinding of another. This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch, while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility for playability. The invention of wound strings, such as nylon covered in wound metal, was a crucial step in string instrument technology, because a metal-wound string can produce a lower pitch than a catgut string of similar thickness. This enabled stringed instruments to be made with less thick bass strings. On string instruments that the player plucks or bows directly (e.g., double bass), this enabled instrument makers to use thinner strings for the lowest-pitched strings, which made the lower-pitch strings easier to play. On stringed instruments in which the player presses a keyboard, causing a mechanism to strike the strings, such as a piano, this enabled piano builders to use shorter, thicker strings to produce the lowest-pitched bass notes, enabling the building of smaller upright pianos designed for small rooms and practice rooms.",
  "/wiki/Geomungo": "The geomungo (also spelled komungo or k\u014fmun'go) or hyeongeum (literally black zither, also spelled hyongum or hy\u014fn'g\u016dm) is a traditional Korean stringed musical instrument of the zither family of instruments with both bridges and frets. Scholars believe that the name refers to Goguryeo and translates to Goguryeo zither or that it refers to the colour and translates to black crane zither (hyeonhakgeum, \ud604\ud559\uae08 / \u7384\u9db4\u7434). The geomungo's place in Korean culture is traditionally that of a scholars instrument for self-cultivation, much like ancient Chinese had done with the guqin in China.",
  "/wiki/Guqin": "The guqin ([ku\u0300t\u0255\u02b0i\u030cn] (listen); Chinese: \u53e4\u7434) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family. It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement, as highlighted by the quote a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason, as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius. It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as the father of Chinese music or the instrument of the sages. The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng, another Chinese long zither also without frets, but with moveable bridges under each string. Traditionally, the instrument was simply referred to as the qin (\u7434) but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well: the yangqin hammered dulcimer, the huqin family of bowed string instruments, and the Western piano are examples of this usage. The prefix gu- (\u53e4; meaning ancient) was later added for clarification. Thus, the instrument is called guqin today. It can also be called qixian-qin (\u4e03\u7d43\u7434; lit. seven-stringed zither). Because Robert Hans van Gulik's book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute, the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute. Other incorrect classifications, mainly from music compact discs, include harp or table-harp. The guqin is a very quiet instrument, with a range of about four octaves, and its open strings are tuned in the bass register.",
  "/wiki/Music_of_China": "Music of China refers to the music of the Chinese people, which may be the music of the Han Chinese as well as other ethnic minorities within mainland China. It also includes music produced by people of Chinese origin in some territories outside mainland China using traditional Chinese instruments or in the Chinese language. It covers a highly diverse range of music from the traditional to the modern. Different types of music have been recorded in historical Chinese documents from the early periods of Chinese civilization which, together with archaeological artifacts discovered, provided evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122 BC - 256 BC). These further developed into various forms of music through succeeding dynasties, producing the rich heritage of music that is part of the Chinese cultural landscape today. Chinese music continues to evolve in the modern times, and more contemporary forms of music have also emerged.",
  "/wiki/Guzheng": "The zheng (Chinese: \u7b8f; pinyin: zh\u0113ng; Wade-Giles: cheng) or guzheng (Chinese: \u53e4\u7b8f; pinyin: g\u01d4zh\u0113ng; literally: 'ancient zheng'), also known as a Chinese zither, is a Chinese plucked string instrument with a more than 2,500-year history. The modern guzheng commonly has 21, 25 or 26 strings, is 64 inches (1.6 m) long, and is tuned in a major pentatonic scale. It has a large, resonant soundboard made from Paulownia. Other components are often made from other woods for structural or decorative reasons. Guzheng players often wear fingerpicks made from materials such as plastic, resin, tortoiseshell, or ivory on one or both hands. The guzheng is ancestral to several other Asian zithers such as the Japanese koto, the Korean gayageum, Mongolian yatga, the Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n tranh, and the Sundanese kacapi. The guzheng should not be confused with the guqin, a Chinese zither with 7 strings played without moveable bridges. The guzheng has gone through many changes during its long history. The oldest specimen yet discovered held 13 strings and was dated to around 500 BCE, possibly during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE). The guzheng became prominent during the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE). By the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) the guzheng may have been the most commonly played instrument in China.",
  "/wiki/Koto_(musical_instrument)": "The koto (\u7b8f) is a Japanese stringed musical instrument derived from the Chinese zheng, and similar to the Mongolian yatga, the Korean gayageum, the Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n tranh, and the Sundanese kacapi. The koto is the national instrument of Japan. Koto are about 180 centimetres (71 in) length, and made from kiri wood (Paulownia tomentosa). They have 13 strings that are usually strung over 13 movable bridges along the width of the instrument. There is also a 17-string variant. Players can adjust the string pitches by moving the white bridges before playing. To play the instrument, the strings are plucked using three finger picks (thumb, index finger, and middle finger).",

The word for music in Japanese is \u97f3\u697d (ongaku), combining the kanji \u97f3 on (sound) with the kanji \u697d gaku (enjoy). Japan is the largest physical music market in the world, worth US$2 billion in sales in physical formats in 2014, and the second-largest overall music market, worth a total retail value of 2.6 billion dollars in 2014 - dominated by Japanese artists, with 37 of the top 50 best-selling albums and 49 of the top 50 best-selling singles in 2014. Local music often appears at karaoke venues, which is on lease from the record labels.

It is a variant of the koto, which traditionally has thirteen strings. The instrument is also known as j\u016bshichi-gens\u014d (\u5341\u4e03\u7d43\u7b8f), seventeen-stringed koto, or bass koto (although kotos with a greater number of strings also exist). The j\u016bshichi-gen was invented in 1921 by Michio Miyagi, a musician who felt that the standard koto lacked the range he sought. His seventeen-stringed creation, sometimes described as a bass koto, has a deeper sound and requires specialized plectra (picks worn attached to the player's fingers with which the strings are plucked). Though his original j\u016bshichi-gen was considerably larger than a normal koto, seventeen-stringed koto of a normal koto size are more common today; these presumably do not have as deep a sound.",
  "/wiki/Se_(instrument)": "The history of the se extends back to early Chinese history. It was one of the most important stringed instruments to be created in China, other than the guzheng. The se was a highly popular instrument during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn period. Together with the qin, it is mentioned in the well-known first poem of the Classic of Poetry, Guan ju, a work dating to the seventh century BCE. Surviving specimens have been excavated from places such as the Hubei and Hunan provinces, and the Jiangnan region of China. Other places include Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Liaoning. In Hubei, the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (in the late 400's BCE) was a treasure trove of ancient Chinese instruments, including a complete set of bianzhong (bronze bells), se, guqin (plucked zither), stone chimes, and a drum. His musical entourage of 21 girls and women were also buried with him. By the Warring States Period, the early types of guzheng emerged, which was developed from the se. Thus, it is sometimes said that the guzheng is essentially a smaller and simplified version of the se (with less strings). According to legend, Fuxi created the se. And so it is believed that by the time of the Xia Dynasty the se had already come into being.",

It is a long zither similar to the guzheng but bowed by scraping with a sorghum stem dusted with resin, a horsehair bow , or a piece of forsythia wood. The musical instrument was popular in the Tang Dynasty, but is today little used except in the folk music of some parts of northern China, where it is called yaqin (simplified: \u8f67\u7434; traditional: \u8ecb\u7434)."
