Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a musical instrument holds under tension so that they can vibrate freely, but controllably. Strings may be \"plain\", consisting only of a single material, like steel, nylon, or gut, or wound, having a \"core\" of one material and an overwinding of another. This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch, while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility for playability.",

  "/wiki/Se_(instrument)": "The history of the se extends back to early Chinese history. It was one of the most important stringed instruments to be created in China, other than the guzheng. The se was a highly popular instrument during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn period. Together with the qin, it is mentioned in the well-known first poem of the Classic of Poetry, \"Guan ju\", a work dating to the seventh century BCE.  Surviving specimens have been excavated from places such as the Hubei and Hunan provinces, and the Jiangnan region of China. Other places include Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Liaoning. In Hubei, the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (in the late 400's BCE) was a treasure trove of ancient Chinese instruments, including a complete set of bianzhong (bronze bells), se, guqin (plucked zither), stone chimes, and a drum. His musical entourage of 21 girls and women were also buried with him.  By the Warring States Period, the early types of guzheng emerged, which was developed from the se.  Thus, it is sometimes said that the guzheng is essentially a smaller and simplified version of the se (with less strings).",

It is a long zither similar to the guzheng but bowed by scraping with a sorghum stem dusted with resin, a horsehair bow , or a piece of forsythia wood. The musical instrument was popular in the Tang Dynasty, but is today little used except in the folk music of some parts of northern China, where it is called yaqin (simplified: \u8f67\u7434; traditional: \u8ecb\u7434).",
