  "/wiki/Hubert_Strolz": "Hubert Strolz (born 26 June 1962), nickname Hubsi, is a former alpine skier from Austria. At the 1988 Olympics in Calgary he won a gold medal in the combined and silver in the Giant Slalom. In the World Cup, he won a combined competition 17 January 1988, in Bad Kleinkirchheim. This event was a part of the Hahnenkamm-races which were transferred to BKK (short name) because there was not enough snow in Kitzb\u00fchel. Hubert was a sober racer and an eternal runner-up by finishing 2nd for 14 times (and in 18 times he finished as the third, always in regard to the Alpine World Cup). He was on the way to win another gold medal in the combined at the 1992 Olympics in Albertville but he fell down in the second leg of the slalom just a short distance before the finish line. Like in that case (he saw it as compensation for having luck by winning the gold medal in Calgary, when the great favourite Pirmin Zurbriggen didn't finish the slalom in this way too), he always didn't interpret losses as an unluck though it seemed so for the public. He did hold the view that his opponents did it better than he (quite often he was - unexpected - intercepted as a race-leader, and in the FIS Alpine Skiing World Championships 1989, he was third in the Super-G but at last Toma\u017e \u010ci\u017eman (22nd starter) could obtain the bronze medal. He now runs a skiing and snowboard school in his hometown Warth.",

  "/wiki/Klaus_Sulzenbacher": "Klaus Sulzenbacher (born 3 February 1965 in Kitzb\u00fchel, Austria) is a former Nordic combined skier. Between 1983 and 1991 he won 14 World Cup competitions, and also won the World Cup twice. At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, he won silver in the 15 km individual competition, and bronze in the 3 x 10 km team competition. At the 1991 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships he finished second in the 15 km individual competition, and won in the 3 x 10 km team event. At the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, he won bronze medals in both the 15 km individual and 3 x 10 km team competitions. Sulzenbacher grew up in Kitzbuehel, Tyrol, which is often considered Austria's mecca of Alpine skiing. That he went to train in Nordic skiing in his youth, and not in Alpine styles, is remarkable given that at the time virtually the entire well-funded Austrian Ski Federation system was geared towards Alpine ski racing. Sulzenbacher must be credited for breaking new ground. As Austria's first successful Nordic skier, Sulzenbacher is regarded as cornerstone for the successes of both Mario Stecher and Felix Gottwald. With four Olympic medals, he is among Austria's most successful Olympic competitors. Following his retirement from competition, he now works as a physiotherapist in Stams.",

The Calgary Games saw two substantial changes in the Nordic combined program. A team event was added, marking the first time that more than one medal would be awarded in Nordic combined. The combined events also changed their format, replacing the points-based system used in previous years with the Gundersen method, in which ski jumping points totals were translated to time gaps for a pursuit cross-country race. This change ensured that the first competitor across the finish line in the cross-country race was the overall Olympic champion.",
