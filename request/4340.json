Enigma followed MCMXC a.D. with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi! (1996), which blended together the Gregorian chants reminiscent from the first album and the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second.

It was Madonna's seventh number-one single on the United States' Billboard Hot 100, and topped the singles charts in many other countries, including Australia, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Rolling Stone listed Like a Prayer among The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The music video, directed by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as a witness to the murder of a girl by white supremacists.

  "/wiki/Let's_All_Chant": "Let's All Chant is a song written by Michael Zager and Alvin Fields and performed by the Michael Zager Band. It was based on an idea originally suggested by former head of A&R Jerry Love after he visited clubs in New York and saw people endlessly chanting Ooh-ah, Ooh-ah. Although Zager was first embarrassed when Love asked him to write a song using these chants, he accepted the proposal and later co-wrote Let's All Chant with Fields. The opening track and lead single from the group's eponymous LP, Let's All Chant was released as a single in December 1977, with the track Love Express as a B-side. An unexpected smash hit, the single reached number one on the disco chart and crossed over to the Soul Singles chart, where it peaked at number 15, and to the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 36. In Europe, the single reached the top 10 in several countries, including the UK, Ireland and France. It eventually sold five million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. Recognizable by both its vocal hooks and its classical section, which is featured in the middle of the song, Let's All Chant was well received by critics, who have praised its musical arrangement and its catchiness. Many reviewers regard the song as a classic of the disco era. It also became a turning point in Michael Zager's career. As well as being used in many TV advertisements and movies, it has become an influential dance song which has been extensively covered or remixed by numerous artists and has been interpolated or sampled in many other tracks."
