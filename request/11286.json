The Wolves also compete in the 2019-20 UEFA Europa League: this is the first time the club has qualified for a European tournament for 39 years, by virtue of finishing in seventh place in the 2018-19 Premier League, their first season in the top tier since the 2011-12 season. Wolves was one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888. The club in 2019-20 is enjoying its 65th season of top flight football; Wolves's longest continuous period in the top tier was 26 consecutive seasons in the 33 years between 1932 and 1965 (n.b. there was no league football between 1939 and 1946 due to World War II). In the 1950s, Wolves were English League champions three times (1953-54, 1957-58 and 1958-59), under the management of Stan Cullis. Wolves have also finished League runners-up on five occasions, most recently in 1959-60. Wolves have won the FA Cup four times, most recently in 1960, and finished runners-up on a further four occasions. The club has also won the Football League Cup twice, in 1974 and 1980. In 1953, Wolves was one of the first British clubs to install floodlights, taking part in televised floodlit friendlies against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956 in the run-up to the creation of the European Cup in 1955 and the first participation of an English club side in that competition in 1956. Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the 1959-60 European Cup and the semi-finals of the 1960-61 European Cup Winners' Cup, and were runners-up to Tottenham Hotspur in the inaugural UEFA Cup Final in 1972.",

  "/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.": "Preston North End Football Club (often shortened to The North End or PNE) is a professional football club in Preston, Lancashire, whose team currently plays in the EFL Championship, the second tier of the English football league system. Originally a cricket club, Preston have been based at Deepdale since 1875. The club first took up football in 1878 as a winter fitness activity and decided to focus on it in May 1880, when the football club was officially founded. Deepdale is now football's oldest ground in terms of continuous use by a major league club. Preston North End was a founder member of the Football League in 1888. In the 1888-89 season, the team won both the inaugural league championship and the FA Cup, the latter without conceding a goal. They were the first team to achieve the Double in English football and, as they were unbeaten in all matches, are remembered as The Invincibles. Preston won the league championship again in 1889-90 but their only major success since then has been their 1938 FA Cup Final victory over Huddersfield Town. The club's most famous players have been Tom Finney and Bill Shankly, who are both commemorated at Deepdale by stands named after them. Other notable players include Tommy Docherty, Alan Kelly Sr. and Graham Alexander. Until 1961, Preston were usually members of the First Division but, having been relegated after the 1960-61 season, they have not yet returned to the top flight. They were first relegated to the Third Division after the 1969-70 season and have spent 28 of the 49 seasons since 1970 in the bottom two divisions, including a span of 19 seasons from 1981-1982 to 1999-2000."
