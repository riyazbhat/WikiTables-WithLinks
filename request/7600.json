Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 5 overall claimed National Championships (3 NCAA Tournament championships, 2 Helms National Championships), as well being a National Runner-Up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. Kansas is the all-time consecutive conference titles record holder with 14 consecutive titles, a streak that ran from 2005 through 2018. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with an active streak of 30 consecutive appearances. Another notable active streak for the Jayhawks is they have been ranked in the AP poll for 211 consecutive polls, a streak that has stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009 poll through the poll released on January 13, 2020, which is the longest active streak in the nation. That streak is 10 behind UCLA's record run of 221 straight from 1966-1980.\n The Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game of basketball, James Naismith. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including Clyde Lovellette, Wilt Chamberlain, Jo Jo White, Danny Manning, Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce, Nick Collison, Kirk Hinrich, Mario Chalmers, Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid. Politician Bob Dole also played basketball at Kansas. Former players that have gone on to be coaches include Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg, and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include John Calipari, Gregg Popovich, and Bill Self. Mark Turgeon, Jerod Haase, and Danny Manning are all former players and assistant coaches that became head coaches. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches and, with Lonborg, was an early proponent of the NCAA tournament. Four different Jayhawk head coaches are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches, Phog Allen, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and current head coach Bill Self. Three different Division I basketball arenas have been named after former Kansas players, the Dean Smith Center named after Dean Smith at North Carolina, Rupp Arena named after Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, and the Jayhawks own arena Allen Fieldhouse named after Phog Allen.\n In 2008, ESPN ranked Kansas second on a list of the most prestigious programs of the modern college basketball era. Kansas currently has the longest streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances of all-time (30), the longest current streak of consecutive NCAA winning seasons (35), the most winning seasons in Division I history (97), the most non-losing seasons (.500 or better) in NCAA history (100), the most conference championships in Division I history (61), the most consecutive regular season conference titles in Division I (14), the most First Team All Americans in Division I history (22), and the most First Team All American Selections in Division I history (29). As of the last complete season, the program ranks third in Division I all-time winning percentage (.725) and second in Division I all-time wins (2,274).\n Since the opening of Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks home arena, in 1955, the Jayhawks have earned a well established home court advantage. Allen Fieldhouse is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball. The Jayhawks have won over 70 percent of their games in Allen Fieldhouse, losing only a little over 100 games in its over 60-year history. Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two streaks that have reached over 50 games.

The program's first game was an 11\u20138 win over the Lincoln YMCA. Three years later, Nebraska played its first game against another university, a 37\u20135 victory over Nebraska Wesleyan. Through 2017, the program has an all-time record of 1,474\u20131,337 (.524) with seven NCAA appearances and 16 NIT appearances. NU's only national tournament championship came in the 1996 NIT.\n Nebraska has the distinction of being the only major conference program to have never won a game in the NCAA Tournament, and did not even make the tournament until 1986. Much of the team's modest success came during the tenure of Danny Nee, head coach from 1987 to 2000. Nee is the program's all-time winningest head coach, with a record of 254\u2013190 (.572). Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their seven NCAA Tournament appearances and six bids to the NIT, including the 1996 NIT championship.  After Nee was fired in 2000, Barry Collier was hired and led the program for six years, until leaving to become athletic director at Butler University, where he had previously coached. Nebraska hired Doc Sadler from UTEP following the departure of Collier. Sadler led the Cornhuskers for six seasons, which included the school's transition from the Big 12 to the Big Ten, but like Collier, he failed to make an NCAA Tournament appearance. NU was coached by Tim Miles from 2012 to 2019, and he took the team to the NCAA Tournament in only his second season, but did not make it back. On March 30, 2019, Nebraska hired former Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg.",
