  "/wiki/Latitude": "In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north\u2013south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the Equator to 90\u00b0 (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east\u2013west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or   normal) to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications.",
