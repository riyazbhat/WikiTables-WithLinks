  "/wiki/Charlie_Conacher_Humanitarian_Award": "The Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award (or Charlie Conacher Memorial Trophy) was an award given to a National Hockey League (NHL) player who made outstanding contribution to humanitarian or community service projects.

The award was not affiliated with the NHL, though it was given to one of the league's players. Toronto Maple Leafs captain George Armstrong was the first winner, named following the 1968\u201369 season. Co-winners were named on two occasions, as Jean Beliveau and Bobby Orr shared the award in 1971, as did Jimmy Peters, Jr. and Gary Bergman in 1973. Calgary Flames co-captain Lanny McDonald was announced as the winner of the award at the 1983 Conacher Hockey Awards dinner, though he was actually the runner-up to Boston Bruins defenceman Brad Park. The mistake was cleared up a few days after the dinner. Calgary's Jim Peplinski was named the final recipient of the award in 1984, after which the trophy was retired and put on display at the newly constructed Charlie Conacher Research Centre for cancer at the Toronto General Hospital."
