  "/wiki/Branch_and_bound": "Branch and bound (BB, B&B, or BnB) is an algorithm  design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.",

  "/wiki/Generative_grammar": "Generative grammar is a linguistic theory that regards linguistics as the study of a hypothesised innate grammatical structure. Similarly to some structuralist theories, such as glossematics, generative grammar considers grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language. The difference from structural and functional models  is that the object is placed into the verb phrase in generative grammar. This theory was developed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s. Linguists who follow the generative approach have been called generativists. The generative school has focused on the study of syntax and addressed other aspects of a language's structure, including morphology and phonology.",
