  "/wiki/Public_Works_Administration": "Public Works Administration (PWA), part of the New Deal of 1933, was a large-scale public  works construction agency in the United States headed by Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. It was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933 in response to the Great Depression. It built large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, hospitals, and schools. Its goals were to spend $3.3 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in all, to provide employment, stabilize purchasing power, and help revive the economy. Most of the spending came in two waves in 1933-35, and again in 1938. Originally called the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, it was renamed the Public Works Administration in 1935 and shut down in 1944.\n The PWA spent over $7 billion in contracts to private construction firms that did the actual work. It created an infrastructure that generated national and local pride in the 1930s and remains vital eight decades later. The PWA was much less controversial than its rival agency with a confusingly similar name, the Works Progress Administration (WPA), headed by Harry Hopkins, which focused on smaller projects and hired unemployed unskilled workers.",

  "/wiki/Gold_rush": "A gold rush or gold fever is a new discovery of gold\u2014sometimes accompanied by other precious metals and rare-earth minerals\u2014that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune. Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and the United States, while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere.\n In the 19th century the wealth that resulted was distributed widely because of reduced  migration costs and low barriers to entry. While gold mining itself proved unprofitable for most diggers and mine-owners, some people made large fortunes, and merchants and transportation facilities made large profits. The resulting increase in the world's gold supply stimulated global trade and investment. Historians have written extensively about the mass migration, trade, colonization and environmental history associated with gold rushes.\n Gold rushes were typically marked by a general buoyant feeling of a \"free-for-all\" in income mobility, in which any single individual might become abundantly wealthy almost instantly, as expressed in the California Dream.\n Gold rushes helped spur waves of immigration that often led to permanent settlement of new regions. Activities propelled by gold rushes define significant aspects of the culture of the Australian and  North American frontiers. At a time when the world's money supply was based on gold, the newly-mined gold provided economic stimulus far beyond the gold fields, feeding into local and wider economic booms.\n Gold rushes occurred as early as the times of the Roman Empire, whose gold mining was described by Diodorus Siculus and Pliny the Elder, and probably further back to ancient Egypt.",
  "/wiki/Grand_Mound_(Minnesota)": "Grand Mound is a prehistoric burial site in Koochiching County, Minnesota, United States.  It is the largest surviving prehistoric structure in the upper Midwest, dating back to 200 BCE.  The site was listed as a National Historic Landmark on June 23, 2011.\n The main burial mound measures 140 feet (43\u00a0m) in length and 100 feet (30\u00a0m) in width, about 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m) high, plus a 200 feet (61\u00a0m) tail measuring 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) in width and 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) in height.  There are four other smaller earthworks at the site, closer in size to typical burial mounds around the Midwest.  Besides the mound, the site contains a number of stratified deposits from villages dating to the Middle Woodland and Late Woodland periods.  The main mound was for many years thought to be typical conical mound, but in the 21st century it was discovered to have a tail, and has been reclassified as an effigy mound, possibly resembling a muskrat.  The mound is part of a larger series of interconnected archaeological sites that include seasonal camp locations and fishing areas.\n The site once had a visitor center operated by the Minnesota Historical Society, opened in 1975.  The visitor center was closed in 2003 and the site was closed to the public in 2007, amid concerns that having tourists viewing burial sites was inappropriate.

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.\n The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture. Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style.\n In form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Therefore, the style defined by symmetry, simple geometry, and social demands instead of ornament. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings.\n In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as Classicism, while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.",
  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture (sometimes referred to as \"Neo-Renaissance\") is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes. Under the broad designation \"Renaissance architecture\" nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque. Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: \"Neo-Renaissance\" might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called \"Italianate\", or when many French Baroque features are present (Second Empire).\n The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English Wollaton Hall, Italian Palazzo Pitti, the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, and the Russian Palace of Facets\u2014all deemed \"Renaissance\"\u2014illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America, the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America, with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period, from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period. The term \"Woodland Period\" was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures. The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region, the Eastern United States, along to the Gulf of Mexico.\n This period is variously considered a developmental stage, a time period, a suite of technological adaptations or \"traits\", and a \"family tree\" of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures. It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools, leather crafting, textile manufacture, cultivation, and shelter construction. Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period, when they were replaced by bows and arrows; however, Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns.\n The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery (although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places), and the diversification of pottery forms, decorations, and manufacturing practices. The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation, also meant that groups became less mobile over time and, in some times and places, people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities. Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000\u20131400 CE and may have continued up to European contact, around 500 years ago.",

  "/wiki/Petroglyph": "A petroglyph is an image created by removing part of a rock surface by incising, picking, carving, or abrading, as a form of rock art. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as \"carving\", \"engraving\", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found worldwide, and are often associated with prehistoric peoples. The word comes from the Greek prefix petro-, from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 petra meaning \"stone\", and \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03c9 gl\u00fdph\u014d meaning \"carve\", and was originally coined in French as p\u00e9troglyphe.\n Another form of petroglyph, normally found in literate cultures, a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on \"living rock\" such as a cliff, rather than a detached piece of stone. While these relief carvings are a category of rock art, sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture, they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art, which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric or nonliterate cultures. Some of these reliefs exploit the rock's natural properties to define an image. Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures, especially in the ancient Near East. Rock reliefs are generally fairly large, as they need to be to make an impact in the open air. Most have figures that are larger than life-size.\n Stylistically, a culture's rock relief carvings relate to other types of sculpture from period concerned. Except for Hittite and Persian examples, they are generally discussed as part of the culture's sculptural practice. The vertical relief is most common, but reliefs on essentially horizontal surfaces are also found. The term relief typically excludes relief carvings inside natural or human-made caves, that are common in India. Natural rock formations made into statues or other sculpture in the round, most famously at the Great Sphinx of Giza, are also usually excluded. Reliefs on large boulders left in their natural location, like the Hittite \u0130mamkullu relief, are likely to be included, but smaller boulders described as stele or carved orthostats.\n The term petroglyph should not be confused with petrograph, which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of rock art or parietal art. Petroforms, or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different. Inuksuit are also not petroglyphs, they are human-made rock forms found only in the Arctic region.",

Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree, but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture.  He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906.\n In 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer.  During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa.  Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences.  In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake.  He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years.\n After plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925.  As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area, the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928.  Oberholtzer served as its first president.  His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program.  In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the President's Quetico-Superior Committee to advise and coordinate government activity concerning the Quetico-Superior area. Oberholtzer was its first chairman, and served as a member until 1968.\n Oberholtzer was one of the eight founding members of The Wilderness Society and served on its executive council from 1937 until 1967.  His addition to The Wilderness Society lent national stature to the group.  In addition to his wilderness campaigning, he spoke fluent Ojibwe and was a fervent student of their culture.  He never married and died in 1977 after a long period of ill health.\n Oberholtzer is recognized today as a leading advocate for the preservation of the Quetico-Superior lake area, as well as an advocate of the Native American culture in that region.

  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration (WPA; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration) was an American New Deal agency, employing millions of job-seekers (mostly unskilled men) to carry out public works projects, including the construction of public buildings and roads. It was established on May 6, 1935, by Executive Order 7034. In one project, Federal Project Number One, the WPA employed musicians, artists, writers, actors and directors in large arts, drama, media, and literacy projects. The five projects dedicated to these were: the Federal Writers\u2019 Project (FWP), the Historical Records Survey (HRS), the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), the Federal Music Project (FMP), and the Federal Art Project (FAP). In the Historical Records Survey, for instance, many former slaves in the South were interviewed; these documents are of great importance for American history. Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States, and gave more than 225,000 performances. Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures, and the development of professional archaeology in the US.\n The WPA's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $4.9 billion (about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP).\n Headed by Harry Hopkins, the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States, while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society. \n Above all, the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets. Thus, under the leadership of the WPA, more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built, in addition to many airports and much housing.\n The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority, which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power. Many famous structures were constructed with the help of WPA labor and funds, including Camp David, the presidential estate in Maryland often used for international meetings, and the on-ramp to San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.\n At its peak in 1938, it provided paid jobs for three million unemployed men and women, as well as youth in a separate division, the National Youth Administration. Between 1935 and 1943, when the agency was disbanded, the WPA employed 8.5 million people. Most people who needed a job were eligible for employment in some capacity. Hourly wages were typically set to the prevailing wages in each area.:70 Full employment, which was reached in 1942 and emerged as a long-term national goal around 1944, was not the goal of the WPA; rather, it tried to provide one paid job for all families in which the breadwinner suffered long-term unemployment.:64, 184\n \"The stated goal of public building programs was to end the depression or, at least, alleviate its worst effects,\" sociologist Robert D. Leighninger asserted. \"Millions of people needed subsistence incomes. Work relief was preferred over public assistance (the dole) because it maintained self-respect, reinforced the work ethic, and kept skills sharp.\":228\n The WPA was a national program that operated its own projects in cooperation with state and local governments, which provided 10\u201330% of the costs. Usually the local sponsor provided land and often trucks and supplies, with the WPA responsible for wages (and for the salaries of supervisors, who were not on relief). WPA sometimes took over state and local relief programs that had originated in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) or Federal Emergency Relief Administration programs (FERA).:63\n It was liquidated on June 30, 1943, as a result of low unemployment due to the worker shortage of World War II.

The church fell into disuse in the 1930s, but the early 1960s Paul Berg, an Episcopal priest in Grand Rapids, discovered the church and organized an effort to restore it. Father Paul contacted the office of the late Archbishop John (Garkl\u0101vs) of Chicago, they learned that there was no record of the parish's existence. The building was rededicated in 1968.
