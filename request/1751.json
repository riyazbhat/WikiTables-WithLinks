  "/wiki/US_11_(NY)": "U.S. Route\u00a011 (US\u00a011) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Canada\u2013US border at Rouses Point, New York. In the state of New York, US\u00a011 extends for 318.66 miles (512.83\u00a0km) from the Pennsylvania state line south of the Southern Tier city of Binghamton to the Canada\u2013US border at the North Country village of Rouses Point, where it becomes Route\u00a0223 upon entering Quebec. The portion of US\u00a011 south of Watertown follows a mostly north\u2013south alignment and is paralleled by Interstate\u00a081 (I-81) while the part of the route north of Watertown follows a more east\u2013west routing, parallel to but not directly on the St. Lawrence River.\n The portion of US\u00a011 in New York passes through the central district of four cities: Binghamton, Cortland, Syracuse, and Watertown. East of Watertown, the route traverses mostly rural terrain and serves only small villages, such as Potsdam, Malone, and Champlain. While the portion of US\u00a011 between the Pennsylvania state line and Watertown is merely an alternate route to I-81, the section east of Watertown is the primary long-distance route across the North Country of New York.\n US\u00a011 was designated as part of the 1926 establishment of the U.S. Highway System. It was first signed in New York in 1927, replacing New York State Route\u00a02 (NY\u00a02), a route assigned three years earlier as part of the creation of the modern New York state route system. The termini of US\u00a011 have more or less remained the same since; however, multiple realignments have occurred along the points in between. One of US\u00a011's three suffixed routes, NY\u00a011C, follows a former routing of US\u00a011.",

It lies in the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter million people. The population of the city itself, according to the 2010 census, is 47,376.\n From the days of the railroad, Binghamton was a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center, and has been known at different times for the production of cigars, shoes, and computers. IBM was founded nearby, and the flight simulator was invented in the city, leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and defense-oriented firms. This sustained economic prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker of the Valley of Opportunity. However, following cuts made by defense firms after the end of the Cold War, the region has lost a significant portion of its manufacturing industry.\n Today, while there is a continued concentration of high-tech firms, Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare- and education-focused city, with the presence of Binghamton University acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization.",

The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route\u00a011 (US\u00a011) in the town of Chenango (just north of Binghamton) in the Southern Tier. The northern terminus is at NY\u00a037 near the village of Morristown in the North Country. In between, the route serves three cities of varying size: Norwich, Utica, and Watertown. The distance between Utica and Binghamton is a major trucking route, and features many gas stations, truck stops, and fast food restaurants. Between Boonville and Lowville, it follows the Black River Valley and between Watertown and Morristown, it follows the St. Lawrence River valley.\n It is a two lane, undivided, full access roadway for the majority of its length, except between the village of New Hartford and Alder Creek, where it is a four-lane highway. Within that span, it is a limited access highway in the city of Utica, referred locally as The Arterial and the North\u2013South Arterial. \n NY\u00a012 intersects several primary east\u2013west routes, including US\u00a020, NY\u00a05, and NY\u00a03. From Barneveld to the town of Remsen (a distance of 11 miles or 18 kilometres), NY\u00a012 overlaps NY\u00a028. NY\u00a012 also intersects US\u00a011 twice: once at its beginning in Binghamton and once in Watertown. Between these intersections, NY\u00a012 arcs eastward from US\u00a011, with the stretch right after Utica being its eastern apex. NY\u00a012 also connects with Interstate\u00a081 (I-81) near both its beginning and end points in the same manner.\n NY\u00a012, as originally assigned in 1924, extended from Chenango in the south to Clayton in the north. It was extended east over the former routing of NY\u00a03 to Alexandria Bay in 1930, then along a new roadway to Morristown in the 1960s. Parts of NY\u00a012 have been rerouted onto new roadways in areas, primarily in Oneida County.",

  "/wiki/I-88_(E)": "Interstate\u00a088 (I-88) is an Interstate Highway located entirely within the U.S. state of New York. Nominally an east\u2013west road as it has an even number, it extends for 117.70 miles (189.42\u00a0km) in a northeast\u2013southwest direction from an interchange with I-81 north of Binghamton to an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90) west of Schenectady. The freeway serves as an important connector route from the Capital District to Binghamton, Elmira (via New York State Route\u00a017 or NY\u00a017, I-86), and Scranton, Pennsylvania (via I-81). I-88 closely parallels NY\u00a07, which was once the main route through the area.\n I-88 was assigned in 1968, and construction of the highway began soon afterward. The first section of I-88 opened in the early 1970s, connecting two communities northeast of Binghamton. The last piece of the freeway was finished in 1989, linking the original segment to I-81 north of Binghamton. Early plans for I-88 called for the road to continue northeast to Troy; however, the east end of the route was moved to Schenectady in the early 1980s. A combined freeway/tollway in Illinois, though not contiguous, was also assigned the I-88 designation in 1987.",

Its southern terminus is located at the Pennsylvania state line south of the town of Vestal in Broome County, where it becomes Pennsylvania Route\u00a0267 (PA\u00a0267). Its northern terminus is located at a junction with NY\u00a012 in the village of Alexandria Bay in Jefferson County. NY\u00a026 serves three cities along its routing; one directly (Rome) and two via other roadways (Binghamton via NY\u00a017 and Watertown via NY\u00a03).\n NY\u00a026, as a single route, was established in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, portions of the route had been signed state routes since the 1920s. Since 1930, the route has been realigned several times in the North Country, resulting in a modern routing significantly different from its initial alignment. For a brief period during the 1970s, NY\u00a026 ended in Carthage. The truncation directly led to the elimination of one of NY\u00a026's two spur routes, and the second was absorbed by other routes shortly afterward.",

Its eastern terminus is at the Pennsylvania state line in the town of Windsor in Broome County, where it connects to Pennsylvania Route\u00a092 (PA\u00a092). NY\u00a079 passes through three regions; it starts in the Finger Lakes region, runs through Central New York and ends on the western fringes of the Catskills.

It runs through some lightly populated regions along the state's southern border, from Central New York to the Catskills. It begins near a busy intersection with Interstate\u00a081 (I-81) at Whitney Point and runs east from there through Greene. The eastern terminus is located at a junction with NY\u00a017 (future I-86) at Roscoe in Sullivan County. It is one of the longest three-digit routes in New York, and the only long one not associated with a two-digit route or a former U.S. Route. Yet due to its location it sees little traffic, although for much of its length it follows the route of a main 19th century thoroughfare, the Catskill Turnpike. It is primarily a long shortcut around Binghamton.\n NY\u00a0206 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but only from Bainbridge to Downsville. NY\u00a0206 was extended west to Whitney Point in the early 1940s; another extension in the late 1970s moved the route's eastern terminus to Roscoe. Prior to becoming NY\u00a0206, the Whitney Point\u2013Greene segment was once New York State Route\u00a0219 and New York State Route\u00a0383 while the portion from Coventry to Bainbridge was previously New York State Route\u00a0218.",
