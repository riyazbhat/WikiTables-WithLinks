  "/wiki/Hydrochlorothiazide": "Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ or HCT) is a diuretic medication often used to treat high blood pressure and swelling due to fluid build up. Other uses include diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis, and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in those with a high calcium level in the urine. For high blood pressure it is sometimes considered as a first-line treatment. HCTZ is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness. Potential side effects include poor kidney function, electrolyte imbalances including low blood potassium and less commonly low blood sodium, gout, high blood sugar, and feeling lightheaded with standing. While allergies to HCTZ are reported to occur more often in those with allergies to sulfa drugs, this association is not well supported. It may be used during pregnancy, but it is not a first-line medication in this group. It is in the thiazide medication class and acts by decreasing the kidneys' ability to retain water.",

It acts as a ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) agonist, and was the first of this class of drugs to be introduced clinically. Acute administration of the drug markedly increases the levels of plasma growth hormone (GH) and reliably induces sensations of hunger and increases food intake in humans.\n Pralmorelin was also under investigation for the treatment of GHD and short stature (pituitary dwarfism), and made it to phase II clinical trials for these indications, but was ultimately never marketed for them.
