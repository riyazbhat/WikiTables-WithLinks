Kyrgyzstan made its Olympic return in boxing after an eight-year absence.\n The Kyrgyzstan roster featured seven returning Olympians, with marathon runner Iuliia Andreeva attending her third straight Games as the oldest and most experienced participant (aged 32). Four of the returnees hailed from the wrestling team, including Asian Games bronze medalist Aisuluu Tynybekova, and veteran Janarbek Kenjeev, who qualified for his second Games after he debuted in 2004. Other notable Kyrgyz athletes included 16-year-old Denis Petrashov, who succeeded his father and three-time Olympian Yevgeny Petrashov to compete in swimming, and light heavyweight boxer Erkin Adylbek Uulu, who led his delegation as the flag bearer in the opening ceremony.\n For the second Olympics in a row, Kyrgyzstan failed to win a single medal in Rio de Janeiro. On August 18, 2016, the International Olympic Committee stripped weightlifter Izzat Artykov of his bronze medal after testing positive for the stimulant strychnine.

  "/wiki/Hydrochlorothiazide": "Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ or HCT) is a diuretic medication often used to treat high blood pressure and swelling due to fluid build up. Other uses include diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis, and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in those with a high calcium level in the urine. For high blood pressure it is sometimes considered as a first-line treatment. HCTZ is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness.\n Potential side effects include poor kidney function, electrolyte imbalances including low blood potassium and less commonly low blood sodium, gout, high blood sugar, and feeling lightheaded with standing. While allergies to HCTZ are reported to occur more often in those with allergies to sulfa drugs, this association is not well supported. It may be used during pregnancy, but it is not a first-line medication in this group.\n It is in the thiazide medication class and acts by decreasing the kidneys' ability to retain water. This initially reduces blood volume, decreasing blood return to the heart and thus cardiac output. It is believed to lower peripheral vascular resistance in the long run.\n Two companies, Merck and Ciba, state they discovered the medication which became commercially available in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic drug and is relatively affordable. In 2016, it was the 12th most prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 43 million prescriptions.",

Moreover, Kazakhstan did not send teams in any of the collective sports for the first time in twenty years. Track and field accounted for the largest number of athletes on the Kazakh squad, with 25 entries. There was a single competitor each in slalom canoeing, track cycling, fencing, and table tennis (for the first time after an eight-year absence).\n Four of the nation's Olympic medalists from London 2012 returned, including defending triple jump champion Olga Rypakova, Russian-born wrestling veteran Guzel Manyurova, and boxers Adilbek Niyazymbetov (light heavyweight) and Ivan Dychko (super heavyweight). Triple jumper and 2006 Asian Games runner-up Roman Valiyev headed the full roster of Kazakh athletes by participating in his fourth Games as the most experienced competitor.

This was the nation's twenty-second appearance at the Summer Olympics, having competed in all editions in the modern era from 1920 onwards, except the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Setting a milestone in Olympic history, Brazil became the first South American country to host the Summer Olympics, and the second Latin American host following the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico.\n In this edition, Brazil beat both its previous highest number of gold medals obtained at one Olympics (five gold medals in Athens 2004), and its record of total medals won at a Games (17 medals in Beijing 2008 and London 2012). Brazil won gold for the first time in two sports: boxing (Robson Concei\u00e7\u00e3o in men's lightweight) and football (men's team).  It was also the first time a Brazilian athlete won three medals at one Games: Isaquias Queiroz in canoeing (two silvers and one bronze). Brazil also won its first ever medals in canoeing sprint, the silver that Queiroz won in C1-1000 m was the first in that sport.\n The shooter Felipe Wu, won the first Brazilian medal in the Rio de Janeiro Games. Wu came very close to taking the top spot on the podium in the men's 10 m air pistol with 202.1 points , but the Vietnamese Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n Vinh hit a brilliant final shot and won the gold medal with an Olympic Record of 202.5 points. The silver medal Felipe Wu won was the first Brazilian medal in Shooting since the Guilherme Paraense at Antwerp 1920 Olympics.\n The first Brazilian gold medal was won by the judoka Rafaela Silva in the women's 57 kg . Rafaela Silva beat Wazari the Mongolian Sumiya Dorjsuren, the incumbent leader of the world ranking, in the final. The other 2 medals in judo were bronze.  Mayra Aguiar and Rafael Silva repeated the same results obtained in London / 2012 achieved third places respectively in women's 78 kg and men's +100 kg events.\n In the Gymnastics, three medals were won by Brazil. Diego Hyp\u00f3lito was the silver medalist and Arthur Mariano won the bronze in men's floor. Diego redeemed himself from falls in Beijing and London, when he was a favorite to win a medal, and finally won his first Olympic medal with a note 15.533. Arthur Mariano was the surprise of the competition by earning the bronze with a note 15.433. The gold medal was won by the British Max Whitlock with a note 15.633. In the men's rings, Arthur Zanetti the incumbent gold medalist in London , made again  a great presentation in the rings and with a note of 15.766 to win the silver medal; the Greek Eleftherios Petrounias won gold with a note of 16.000.\n The swimmer Poliana Okimoto became the first Brazilian woman in the History to obtain an Olympic Medal in swimming. Originally she finished in fourth place in the Women's 10 km open water, but later was upgraded to the bronze medal with a time of 1:56:51.4 after the disqualification of the French swimmer Aur\u00e9lie Muller.\n In the Athletics, it happened perhaps the most positively unexpected results for the host nation in men's pole vault. The jumper Thiago Braz da Silva won the second gold medal of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro in a thrilling duel with French pole-vaulter Renaud Lavillenie, the world record holder and gold medalist in London/2012. In the final, Lavillenie and Braz were the only 2 athletes to achieve the high of 5.93m and consequently they were the only 2 left to dispute the gold medal. Lavillenie managed to clear the next height, 5.98m, easily with his first attempt, but da Silva decided to skip 5.98m and went on to 6.03m. With a successful second attempt at 6.03m, da Silva set a new Olympic Record. Lavillenie, having failed his first two attempts at 6.03m, attempted 6.08 with his final jump but failed, knocking the bar off with his knee. Thiago Braz da Silva won the gold medal with an Olympic record and surpassing his personal best performance in 10\u00a0cm ,despite never having won a medal in a senior global competition.\n In the Canoeing, the first Olympic medals ever were conquered by Brazilians in the history of the sport. Isaquias Queiroz was the first Brazilian athlete in history to win three medals ( two silver medals and one bronze) at a single edition of the Olympic Games, and the first sprint canoe athlete from any nationality to do so in the history of the Olympics. The first silver medal came in the men's C-1 1000 m. After a duel with German Olympic and world champion Sebastian Brendel, Isaquias Queiroz managed to keep up the pace and climbed the podium with the second fastest time (3m58s529). The bronze medal came in  men's C-1 200 m with a time of 39s628. Queiroz's third medal came in  men's C-2 1000 metres, together with Erlon Silva. They stayed in the lead for most of the time of race, but they were surpassed in the final meters by Germans Sebastian Brendel and Jan Vandrey and took the silver medal with a time of 3m44s819.\n The third gold medal obtained by the host country was in boxing. Robson Concei\u00e7\u00e3o has made history on his home turf by becoming the first Brazilian boxer to take a gold medal. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o defeated France's Sofiane Oumiha in the men's lightweight final with a unanimous decision. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o's achievement is particularly inspiring given his humble upbringing and after being defeated in his first fights in Beijing and London.\n The sailores Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze took the country's fourth gold medal in women's 49erFX. They were the first Brazilian women sailores to win a gold Olympic medal. The competition was tight. The duos representing Brazil, Denmark, and Spain were tied when they reached the final, followed by the New Zealanders one point below. The podium would be defined by their positions on the final race. Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze took the gold, New Zealanders Alex Maloney and Molly Meech the silver, and Denmark's Jena Mai Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen the bronze. Martine Grael continued the tradition of her family in sailing at Olympics: her father Torben Grael is five-time Olympic medalist (twice gold) and her uncle Lars Grael is twice bronze medalist.\n In beach volleyball, Brazilians took two medals. \u00c1gatha Bednarczuk and B\u00e1rbara Seixas defeated  in the semifinal the reigning Olympic champion Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross, the first defeat of Kerri Walsh after 26 Olympic matches; in the final of the women's beach volleyball tournament, the Brazilians lost to Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst of Germany by 2 to 0 and took the silver medal in the sands of Copacabana Beach. In the men's beach volleyball tournament, came the fifth gold medal. Alison Cerutti and Bruno Schmidt beat the Italians Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo in straight sets, 21-19, 21-17. While this is the first Olympic medal for Bruno Schmidt, Alison took in London/2012 the silver medal with then-partner Emanuel Rego.\n In taekwondo, a bronze medal was conquered by Maicon Siqueira in men's +80 kg category. He was the first Brazilian man ever to gain an Olympic medal in taekwondo. In a dramatic bronze medal dispute, he beat beat the British Mahama Cho at the last seconds by 5 to 4 and won the bronze medal.\n Finally, in the last two days of the competitions , two gold medals were conquered in the 2 most populars sports in Brazil. In the men's tournament of the football the dreamed gold medal was conquered by Brazil national under-23 football team, after 4 Olympic finals and 3 silver medals in 2012, 1988 and 1984. In the campaign that began with suspicion after two scoreless draws with South Africa and Iraq, the team easily defeat Denmark, Colombia and Honduras until they reached the gold medal match against Germany. In the final at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, there was a 1-1 draw, in which Neymar scored in the normal time. In the penalties shoot-out, after eight flawless kicks, until the goalkeeper Weverton defend the penalty shot by Nils Petersen. Neymar converted the decisive penalty , so Brazil team won the penalties shoot-out by 5 to 4 and won the gold medal for the first time in Olympic history, in one of the most iconic moments of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n The seventh gold medal and last medal won by the host nation in the 2016 Summer Olympics was in the men's indoor tournament of volleyball. Coached by Bernardo Rezende, the Brazil men's national volleyball team had two defeats in the preliminary round, needing a victory against France in the last match to avoid elimination. After that, Brazil defeat Argentina in the quarter-finals and Russia in the semifinals. Brazil reached their fourth consecutive final - the sixth in history - and re-edited the 2004 gold decision against Italy. After two consecutive silver medals, Brazil triumphed the gold medal match by 3 to 0. Among the volleyball players Bruno Rezende, coach Bernardo Rezende's son won his third consecutive Olympic medal and S\u00e9rgio Santos became the Brazilian team sports athlete with the most medals, as he participated in every men's indoor final since Athens 2004.",

  "/wiki/Continuous_erythropoietin_receptor_activator": "Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) is the generic term for drugs in a new class of third-generation erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). In the media, these agents are commonly referred to as 'EPO', short for erythropoietin. CERAs have an extended half-life and a mechanism of action that promotes increased stimulation of erythropoietin receptors compared with other ESAs.\n Under the trade name Mircera, Roche Pharmaceuticals received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2008 to market a continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, including in those undergoing dialysis. .[citation needed]  This issue appears to have been resolved since Fresenius Medical dialysis clinics in the US are now administering this drug.[citation needed]) Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta had been approved by the European Commission in August 2007, and was made available in Europe at the start of 2008.\n In terms of its structure, Mircera is similar to the previous synthetic EPO drugs, except that it is connected to a chemical called polyethylene glycol (PEG), which makes it last longer in the body. According to Roche, the product has the longest half-life of all FDA-approved erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): up to 6 times longer than darbepoetin alfa and up to 20 times longer than epoetin. CERAs thus promise both lower dosing\u2014significant owing to the high inherent cost of manufacturing recombinant protein drugs\u2014and less frequent injections for patients. ESAs are administered via subcutaneous injections, often in doctor's offices for patients who lack the skill or dexterity to inject themselves, so the once- or twice-monthly dosing regimen for CERAs promises fewer costly, inconvenient office visits for patients requiring constant hemoglobin level maintenance for chronic kidney disease.\n In clinical trials, CERA dosed every 3 to 4 weeks demonstrated efficacy similar to that of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin concentrations within the target hemoglobin range. CERA has generally been well tolerated in clinical trials.[citation needed]",

This was Russia's sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation.\n On 18 July 2016, an independent investigation commissioned by World Anti-Doping Agency concluded that it was shown \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the RUSADA, the Ministry of Sport, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia had \"operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes\" within a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using \"the disappearing positive [test] methodology.\" According to the McLaren Report, the Disappearing Positive Methodology operated from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015.\" It was used on 643 positive samples, a number that the authors consider \"only a minimum\" due to limited access to Russian records. Based on these findings the International Olympic Committee called for an emergency meeting to consider banning Russia from the Summer Olympics.\n On 24 July, the IOC rejected WADA's recommendation to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics and announced that a decision would be made by each sport federation. With each positive decision having to be approved by a CAS arbitrator. On 7 August 2016, the IOC cleared 278 athletes, while 111 were removed because of the scandal.\n On 7 August 2016, the International Paralympic Committee announced that it had voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian Paralympic team from competing at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, in the wake of a larger scandal that exposed the participation of Russian Olympic and Paralympic athletes in a state-sponsored doping program. \n On 8 December 2016, silver medalist Misha Aloyan was found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation after testing positive for Tuaminoheptane, a specified stimulant, prohibited in-competition under S6 on the WADA Prohibited List, during an in-competition doping control on 21 August 2016. The results obtained by the athlete at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games were disqualified.\n On 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation claimed that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) were involved in a cover-up. Emails indicate that athletes who tested positive for banned substances included five blind powerlifters, who may have been given drugs without their knowledge, and a fifteen-year-old.",

Since the nation's participation started in 1900 (and its official debut in 1924), Romanian athletes had appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, except for two occasions: the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles at the period of the worldwide Great Depression, and the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.\n The Romanian team consisted of 97 athletes, 34 men and 63 women, across fourteen sports, their smallest in Summer Olympic history since 1988. For the fourth time in history, Romania fielded more female athletes than males at the Games, due to the proliferation of women in both athletics and rowing making the cut and the comeback of the women's handball squad after being absent from London 2012.\n Romania left Rio de Janeiro with four medals (one gold, one silver, and two bronze), signifying the country's poorest performance in Olympic history since 1952. The women's \u00e9p\u00e9e team brought home Romania's only gold medal at the Games, beating the top-ranked Chinese team in the final match with the help of early unmatched touches from four-time Olympian Ana Maria Br\u00e2nz\u0103. Horia Tec\u0103u and his partner Florin Mergea secured a historic first Olympic tennis medal of any color for their team, a silver in the men's doubles. The women's eight rowing squad made a late surge to obtain the final podium spot, while Russian-born Albert Saritov closed out the nation's overall tally at the Games with a bronze in freestyle wrestling. For the first time since 1972, Romanian athletes failed to earn an Olympic medal in artistic gymnastics. \n Originally, Romania collected a total of five medals.
