He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\". Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us (after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9). Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals.",
  "/wiki/Black-shanked_douc": "The black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes) is an endangered species of douc found mostly in the forests of eastern Cambodia, with some smaller populations in Vietnam. This species is unique among the doucs in having a largely greyish-blue face. No global population estimate exists, although the Wildlife Conservation Society report an estimated 23,000 individuals present in Cambodia's Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary. Prior to the discovery of the significance of this population, the largest populations were believed to be in adjacent Vietnam, where the largest known population is around 500-600 individuals. They are primarily arboreal and their diet consists on leaves, of which they obtain most of their water.",

  "/wiki/Golden_snub-nosed_monkey": "The golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) is an Old World monkey in the subfamily Colobinae. It is endemic to a small area in temperate, mountainous forests of central and Southwest China. They inhabit these mountainous forests of Southwestern China at elevations of 1,500-3,400 m above sea level. The Chinese name is Sichuan golden hair monkey (\u56db\u5ddd\u91d1\u4e1d\u7334). It is also widely referred to as the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey. Of the three species of snub-nosed monkeys in China, the golden snub-nosed monkey is the most widely distributed throughout China. Snow occurs frequently within its range and it can withstand colder average temperatures than any other non-human primates. Its diet varies markedly with the seasons, but it is primarily a herbivore with lichens being its main food source.",
  "/wiki/Black_snub-nosed_monkey": "The black snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), also known as the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, is a large black and white primate that lives only in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan, where it is known to the locals as the Yunnan golden hair monkey (\u6ec7\u91d1\u4e1d\u7334) and the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (\u9ed1\u767d\u4ef0\u9f3b\u7334).  The common name, black snub-nosed monkey, is issued to Rhinopithecus strykeri, inhabiting in Northern Sino-Myanmar border. Coniferous and deciduous forests in the mountainous regions of Yunnan are the ideal terrain for these primates. It is threatened by habitat loss, and is considered an endangered species. With their unique adaptations to their environment, these monkeys thrive at extreme altitudes despite the below freezing temperatures and thin air. This primate's diet is mainly made up of the large amounts of lichens available in their region. Recent studies have provided more information on the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey, but there is still much to learn about them.",

It is a black and white monkey with a pink nose and lips and blue patches around the eyes. It is found at altitudes of 200 to 1,200 m (700 to 3,900 ft) on fragmentary patches of forest on craggy limestone areas. First described in 1912, the monkey was rediscovered in 1990 but is exceedingly rare. In 2008, fewer than 250 individuals were thought to exist, and the species was the subject of intense conservation effort. The main threats faced by these monkeys are habitat loss and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the species as \"critically endangered\".",
