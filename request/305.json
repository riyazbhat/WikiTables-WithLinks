  "/wiki/Women%27s_professional_wrestling": "Professional wrestling is a dramatic enactment of wrestling as a spectator sport. As is the norm for this sport, women's professional wrestling is organized by wrestling federations called promotions. Some promotions are exclusively for women, while others have separate divisions for women. Among the nations that have women's professional wrestling are Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Some promotions such as WWE traditionally don't announce the weight of female competitors during their ring entrances due to the old adage \"you don't ask a woman her weight\".",

The championship was later acquired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1983 when the WWF, once a member of the NWA, bought the rights to the championship from The Fabulous Moolah and continued to use the belts.

Much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts. An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included.",

A version of the Missouri Championship has been documented to exist in 1899, 1921, 1933 to 1934, 1937, 1947, 1950, and 1954 to 1955, but it was only in 1972 that a serious championship was established.
