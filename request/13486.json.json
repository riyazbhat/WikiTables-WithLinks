  "/wiki/Perfect_fourth": "A fourth is a musical interval encompassing four staff positions in the music notation of Western culture, and a perfect fourth (Play\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) is the fourth spanning five semitones (half steps, or half tones). For example, the ascending interval from C to the next F is a perfect fourth, because the note F is the fifth semitone above C, and there are four staff positions between C and F. Diminished and augmented fourths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (four and six, respectively).",

  "/wiki/Major_third": "In classical music from Western culture, a third is a musical interval encompassing three staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major third (Play\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) is a third spanning four semitones. Along with the minor third, the major third is one of two commonly occurring thirds. It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two: the major third spans four semitones, the minor third three. For example, the interval from C to E is a major third, as the note E lies four semitones above C, and there are three staff positions from C to E. Diminished and augmented thirds span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (two and five).",

  "/wiki/Major_sixth": "In music from Western culture, a sixth is a musical interval encompassing six note letter names or staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major sixth is one of two commonly occurring sixths. It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two. The major sixth spans nine semitones. Its smaller counterpart, the minor sixth, spans eight semitones. For example, the interval from C up to the nearest A is a major sixth. It is a sixth because it encompasses six note letter names (C, D, E, F, G, A) and six staff positions. It is a major sixth, not a minor sixth, because the note A lies nine semitones above C. Diminished and augmented sixths (such as C\u266f to A\u266d and C to A\u266f) span the same number of note letter names and staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (seven and ten).",

The greater septimal tritone (also Euler's tritone), is an interval with ratio 10:7 (617.49 cents).

A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions (see Interval number for more details). For example, the interval from C to D is a major second, as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions. Diminished, minor and augmented seconds are notated on adjacent staff positions as well, but consist of a different number of semitones (zero, one, and three).",

The size of a ditone varies according to the sizes of the two tones of which it is compounded.
