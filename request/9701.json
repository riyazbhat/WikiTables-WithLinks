The Bloc was formed by Members of Parliament (MPs) who defected from the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party during the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord. Founder Lucien Bouchard was a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.\n The party seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of Quebec from Canada and campaigns actively only within the province during federal elections.  The party has been described as social democratic and separatist (aka \"sovereigntist\").\n The Bloc was the largest party in Quebec after Canadian federal elections, and either the second- or third-largest party in the House of Commons, for seven straight federal elections from the 1993 election until 2011.  The 2011 election saw the party win just four seats and lose official party status after a wave of support for the New Democratic Party.  By 2014, the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions.  In the 2015 federal election, the Bloc won 10 seats in the House of Commons, even though the party's leader Gilles Duceppe failed to win a seat. In the 2019 federal election, the party won 32 seats, regaining official party status as a result.\n The Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ, whose members are known as P\u00e9quistes), a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence, but the two are not linked organizationally. As with its provincial counterpart, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec, from sections of organized labour to more conservative rural voters. Members and supporters are known in French as Bloquistes (pronounced\u00a0[bl\u0254kist]).",

  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada": "The Conservative Party of Canada (French: Parti conservateur du Canada), colloquially known as the Tories, is a federal political party in Canada. It was formed in 2003 from the multiple right-wing parties which had existed in Canada for over a century, historically grouped into two camps, \"Red Tories\" and \"Blue Tories\". The party sits at the centre-right to the right-wing of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Liberal Party of Canada positioned centre to centre-left. Like their federal Liberal rivals, the party is defined as a \"big tent\", welcoming a broad variety of members. The party's leader is Andrew Scheer, who serves as Leader of the Official Opposition until his announcement of resignation on 12 December 2019.\n From Confederation till 1942, the original Conservative Party of Canada participated in numerous governments. Before 1942, the predecessors to the Conservatives had multiple names, but by 1942, the main right-wing Canadian force became known as the Progressive Conservatives. In 1957, John Diefenbaker became the first Prime Minister from the Progressive Conservative Party, and remained in office until 1963.\n Another Progressive Conservative government was elected after the results of the 1979 federal election, with Joe Clark becoming Prime Minister. Clark served from 1979 to 1980, when he was defeated by the Liberal Party after the 1980 federal election. In 1984, the Progressive Conservatives won with Brian Mulroney becoming Prime Minister. Mulroney was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, and his government was marked by free trade agreements and economic liberalization. The party suffered a near complete loss after the 1993 federal election, thanks to a splintering of the right-wing; the Conservatives' other predecessor, the Reform Party, led by Preston Manning placed in third, leaving the Progressive Conservatives in fifth. A similar result occurred in 1997, and in 2000, when the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance.\n In 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged, forming the Conservative Party of Canada. The unified Conservative Party claims to generally favour lower taxes, small government, more transfer of federal government powers to the provinces modeled after the Meech Lake Accord and a tougher stand on \"law and order\" issues.\n Under its first Leader Stephen Harper, the party governed with two minority governments after the 2006 federal election and 2008.
