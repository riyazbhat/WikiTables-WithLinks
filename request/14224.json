He has described his mental strength and physical fitness as his greatest abilities as a skier, with his main weakness being a lack of sprinting ability.\n Wassberg won four Olympic gold medals: in 15 km (1980), 50 km (1984), and the 4 \u00d7 10 km relay (1984, 1988), and served as the Olympic flag bearer for Sweden in 1988.

Wassberg subsequently suggested to Mieto that the gold medal should be split between them \"as one one-hundredth of a second is nothing in a 15-kilometer race\". This incident led the International Ski Federation (FIS) to change their timing to the nearest one-tenth of a second. It also resulted in an apocryphal urban legend that Wassberg and Mieto's medals were cut in half and re-welded into half-gold, half-silver medals. At the 1984 Winter Olympics, Wassberg beat out fellow Swede Gunde Svan by 4.9 seconds in the 50 km, the closest margin of victory ever in that event until Giorgio Di Centa edged out Yevgeny Dementyev by 0.8 seconds at the 2006 Winter Olympics though the 2006 event was a mass start event while the 1984 event was an interval start event.\n He won the World Cup in 1977, and in 1980 was awarded the Holmenkollen medal. For some reason his teammate Sven-\u00c5ke Lundb\u00e4ck did not receive the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1978.

This was subsequently implemented by FIS in 1986.\n After retiring from competitions Wassberg worked as a sports reporter for Swedish Radio and a cross-country skiing coach for his club \u00c5sarna IK.
