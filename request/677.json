The Bloc was formed by Members of Parliament (MPs) who defected from the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party during the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord. Founder Lucien Bouchard was a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.\n The party seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of Quebec from Canada and campaigns actively only within the province during federal elections.  The party has been described as social democratic and separatist (aka \"sovereigntist\").\n The Bloc was the largest party in Quebec after Canadian federal elections, and either the second- or third-largest party in the House of Commons, for seven straight federal elections from the 1993 election until 2011.  The 2011 election saw the party win just four seats and lose official party status after a wave of support for the New Democratic Party.  By 2014, the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions.  In the 2015 federal election, the Bloc won 10 seats in the House of Commons, even though the party's leader Gilles Duceppe failed to win a seat. In the 2019 federal election, the party won 32 seats, regaining official party status as a result.\n The Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ, whose members are known as P\u00e9quistes), a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence, but the two are not linked organizationally.

Reform was founded as a Western Canada-based protest movement and eventually became a populist conservative party, with strong social conservative elements. It was initially motivated by the perceived need for democratic reforms and by profound Western Canadian discontent with the Progressive Conservative (PC) federal government of Brian Mulroney.\n Led by its founder Preston Manning, Reform rapidly gained momentum in western Canada, and successfully supplanted the PCs as the largest party in Western Canada after the 1993 election. In opposition, the party advocated for spending restraint and democratic reform. In the leadup to the 1997 election, the party attempted to make a national breakthrough and replace the ailing PCs. However, a Liberal victory and disappointment with the lack of Eastern seats led many members to question the future direction of the party.\n The party was directly succeeded by the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which merged with the Progressive Conservative Party in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.",

He should not be confused with John Hamilton Gray, a Prince Edward Island politician (and Father of Confederation) in the same era.\n Gray was born in St. George's, Bermuda.  His father, William, was naval commissary in Bermuda and later served as British consul in Norfolk, Virginia.  Gray's grandfather, Joseph Gray, was a United Empire Loyalist from Boston who settled in Halifax, Nova Scotia following the American Revolution.\n John Hamilton Gray was educated at King's College in Nova Scotia after which he became a lawyer in Saint John, New Brunswick. He also served as a captain in the New Brunswick Regiment of Yeomany Cavalry becoming a major in the Queen's New Brunswick Ranger by 1850. In 1854 he became lieutenant-colonel of the regiment.\n Politically, Gray was a high Tory Conservative but also a moderate reformer.  He joined the New Brunswick Colonial Association after it was founded in 1849. Gray moved a motion calling for a \"federal union of the British North American colonies, preparatory to their immediate independence.\" The motion was defeated but was an anticipation of Canadian confederation. Gray was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as a supporter of the Colonial Association's platform of reforms in opposition to the Compact government. Lieutenant Governor Edmund Walker Head appointed Gray to the Executive Council causing the reform opposition to collapse and ending Gray's career as a Liberal. He was created a Queen's Counsel In 1853.\n Gray became leader of the Conservatives in the Legislative Assembly and found himself leader of the opposition after the 1854 elections, the first held under responsible government, elected a Liberal (or Reform) administration ending \"compact\" government. In 1855, Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Manners-Sutton dismissed the Reform government over its attempt to institute prohibition and asked Gray to form an administration.\n As Premier, Gray led the Conservatives to victory in the June 1856 election on an anti-prohibition platform and repealed the liquor law. However, with the central issue uniting his government now resolved he became unable to command a majority in the legislature and resigned in May 1857.\n Gray continued in opposition as a Conservative MLA. He also led committees of inquiry into railway construction and investigated allegations of patronage and corruption but he concluded that the railway was \"sound\". After 1860, Gray drifted away from his fellow Conservatives and became supportive of Samuel Leonard Tilley's Liberal government but was defeated in the 1861 election for his efforts.\n Out of elected politics, Gray returned to his practice as a lawyer and was appointed to an inquiry board on the land question in Prince Edward Island.\n Gray became an active supporter of Canadian Confederation and joined Tilley's new Liberal-Conservative Party returning to the legislature in a by-election in 1864. Gray served as a delegate to the Charlottetown Conference only to return to New Brunswick to face growing hostility to the confederation project and lost his seat in the 1865 election that brought the  Anti-Confederation Party to power. Gray returned to the legislature in 1866 and served as Speaker.  When confederation became a reality, Gray won a seat in the House of Commons.\n He did not run for re-election in 1872.  He was appointed judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and moved west reluctantly.  He served on the 1885 Royal Commission on Chinese immigration.",
