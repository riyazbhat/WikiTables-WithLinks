  "/wiki/Transatlantic_tunnel": "A transatlantic tunnel is a theoretical tunnel that would span the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe possibly for such purposes as mass transit. Some proposals envision technologically advanced trains reaching speeds of 500 to 8,000 kilometres per hour (310 to 4,970 mph). Most conceptions of the tunnel envision it between the United States and the United Kingdom \u2012 or more specifically between New York City and London.\n Advantages compared to air travel could be increased speed, and use of electricity instead of scarce oil based fuel, considering a future time long after peak oil.\n The main barriers to constructing such a tunnel are cost with estimates of between $88 billion to $175 billion as well as the limits of current materials science. Existing major tunnels, such as the Channel Tunnel, Seikan Tunnel and the Gotthard Base Tunnel, despite using less expensive technology than any yet proposed for the transatlantic tunnel, may struggle financially[citation needed].",

The concept of Hyperloop transportation was first introduced by Elon Musk on August 12, 2013. The planned route runs from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada. The original Hyperloop concept is proposed to use a linear electric motor to accelerate and decelerate an electromagnetically levitated pod through a low-pressure tube. The vehicle would glide silently for miles at speeds up to 760 mph (1223.1 km/h) with very low turbulence The system is proposed to be entirely autonomous, quiet, direct-to-destination and on-demand.
