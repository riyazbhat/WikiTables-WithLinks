Knowledge of Aaron, along with his brother Moses, comes exclusively from religious texts, such as the Bible and Quran.\n The Hebrew Bible relates that, unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman (prophet) to the Pharaoh. Part of the Law (Torah) that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites.\n Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the North Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah). Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.",

Its use as a Christian name was due to the veneration of St Anthony the Great, the founder of Christian monasticism, particularly in Egypt. Also significant was the later cult of St Antony of Padua. The spelling with h is not found until the 16th century when William Camden claimed that the name derived from the Greek \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (anthos, flower or possibly a small yellow bird such as a wagtail).",

  "/wiki/Owen_(name)": "Owen is usually an anglicised variant of the Welsh personal name Owain. Originally a patronymic, Owen became a fixed surname in Wales beginning with the reign of Henry VIII.

Morgan and Morgan note that there are less likely alternative explanations, and agree with Rachel Bromwich that Welsh Owein is normally latinised as Eugenius, and that both the Welsh and Irish forms are Latin derivatives.
