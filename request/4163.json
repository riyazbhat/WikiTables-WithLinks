His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. Lights were installed around the track in 1998, and today it is the third-largest single lit outdoor sports facility.

CCS is one of the largest club level racing organizations in the U.S., operating more than 60 sanctioned events each year at most of the nation's premier motorsports road-course facilities.\n CCS operates as multiple regions throughout the country, divided mostly by geography for both ease of administration and to allow participants to focus on one championship series for the region that is closest to them, which obviates the need for them to travel all over the country in pursuit of a championship.  Doing so would make the pursuit of championships biased towards those racers who have the time and finances to travel widely.\n CCS also partners with many other organizations to provide track days, practice dates, and additional racing classes (e.g., USGPRU) during their event weekends.",

It is the oldest established motorsport world championship. The current top division is known as MotoGP since 2002 when the four-stroke era began. Prior to that, the largest class was 500cc, both of which form a historical continuum as the official World Championship, although all classes have official status.\n Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are generally unavailable for purchase by the general public or able to be ridden legally on public roads. This contrasts with the various production-based categories of racing, such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man TT Races that feature modified versions of road-going motorcycles available to the public.\n The championship is currently divided into four classes: Moto Grand Prix, Moto2, Moto3 and MotoE. The first three classes use four-stroke engines, while the MotoE class (new in 2019) uses electric motors, much like the four-wheeler, single-seater all-electric racing series Formula E. The 2019 MotoGP season comprises 19 Grands Prix, with 12 held in Europe, three in Asia, two in the Americas, and one each in Australia and the Middle East.\n The most successful rider in Grand Prix history is Giacomo Agostini with 15 titles and 122 race wins.

It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, approximately six miles (10 km) west of Downtown Indianapolis.\n Constructed in 1909, it is the second purpose-built, banked oval racing circuit after Brooklands and the first to be called a 'speedway'.\nIt is the third-oldest permanent automobile race track in the world, behind Brooklands and the Milwaukee Mile. With a permanent seating capacity of 257,325, it is the highest-capacity sports venue in the world.\n Considered relatively flat by American standards, the track is a 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km) rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its construction. It has two 5\u20448-mile-long (1,000 m) straightaways, four geometrically identical 1\u20444-mile (400 m) turns, connected by two 1\u20448-mile (200 m) short straightaways, termed \"short chutes\", between turns 1 and 2, and between turns 3 and 4.\n A modern, FIA Grade One infield road course was completed in 2000, incorporating part of the oval, including the main stretch and the southeast turn, measuring 2.605 miles (4.192 km). In 2008, and again in 2014, the road course layout was modified to accommodate motorcycle racing, as well as to improve competition. Altogether, the current grounds have expanded from an original 320 acres (1.3 km2) on which the speedway was first built to cover an area of over 559 acres (2.3 km2). Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it is the only such site to be affiliated with automotive racing history.\n In addition to the Indianapolis 500, the speedway also hosts NASCAR's Brickyard 400 and Pennzoil 150. From 2000 to 2007, the speedway hosted the Formula One United States Grand Prix, and from 2008 to 2015 the Moto GP.\n On the grounds of the speedway is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum, which opened in 1956, and houses the Hall of Fame. The museum moved into its current building located in the infield in 1976. Also on the grounds is the Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort, which originally opened as the Speedway Golf Course in 1929. The golf course has 14 holes outside the track, along the backstretch, and four holes in the infield. The speedway also served as the venue for the opening ceremonies for the 1987 Pan American Games.
