  "/wiki/Championship_Cup_Series": "The Championship Cup Series (CCS) is an American motorcycle racing sanctioning body. The American Sportbike Racing Association LLC (ASRA) is the parent company of CCS. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, CCS has been in operation since 1984, founded by Roger Edmondson in Asheville, North Carolina. It is currently owned and operated by Kevin Elliott. CCS is one of the largest club level racing organizations in the U.S., operating more than 60 sanctioned events each year at most of the nation's premier motorsports road-course facilities. CCS operates as multiple regions throughout the country, divided mostly by geography for both ease of administration and to allow participants to focus on one championship series for the region that is closest to them, which obviates the need for them to travel all over the country in pursuit of a championship. Doing so would make the pursuit of championships biased towards those racers who have the time and finances to travel widely. CCS also partners with many other organizations to provide track days, practice dates, and additional racing classes (e.g., USGPRU) during their event weekends.",
