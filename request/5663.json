  "/wiki/Tetris": "Tetris (Russian: \u0422\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441 [\u02c8t\u025btr\u02b2\u026as]; portmanteau of tetromino and tennis) is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport. The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines are cleared at once. Tetris was the first game to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States, where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The game is a popular use of tetrominoes, the four-element case of polyominoes, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907. (The name for these figures was given by the mathematician Solomon W. Golomb in 1953.) The game, or one of its many variants, is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system, as well as on devices such as graphing calculators, mobile phones, portable media players, PDAs, Network music players, and as an Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes.",

  "/wiki/PBS": "The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor. It is a nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational television programming to public television stations in the United States, distributing series such as American Experience, America's Test Kitchen, Antiques Roadshow, Arthur, Barney & Friends, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Downton Abbey, Finding Your Roots, Frontline, The Magic School Bus, Masterpiece, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Nature, Nova, the PBS NewsHour, Reading Rainbow, Sesame Street, Teletubbies, and This Old House. PBS is funded by a combination of member station dues, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Datacast, pledge drives, and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens. All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source. Since the mid-2000s, Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States. A 2016\u20132017 study by Nielsen Media Research found 80% of all US television households view the network's programs over the course of a year. However, PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations, a large proportion of which may come from its member stations, including WGBH-TV, WETA-TV, WNET, WTTW, WHYY-TV, Twin Cities PBS, American Public Television, and independent producers.

The channel originally launched in 1982 as CNN2, a spin-off of CNN. Its original format focused on standardized, regularly updated segments at thirty-minute intervals twenty-four hours a day, briefly covering various areas of interest, such as national news, sports, entertainment, weather, and business. In 2001, the channel began to diverge from this strict rolling news format, adding more live-anchored programming (after having largely used automation to cycle pre-recorded segments on air), and later introducing a primetime block featuring long-form and personality-based programs, with hosts such as conservative pundit Glenn Beck and legal commentator Nancy Grace among others. In the mid-2010s, HLN repositioned itself as a social media-centric network, highlighting headlines popular on social networking services, and introducing several programs relating to the subject of social media. Under new CNN president Jeff Zucker, the channel began to backpedal on this programming in 2016, gradually shifting to a focus on crime, regional headlines, and entertainment stories (in contrast to CNN's current focus on politics), and true crime programming. As of July 2015, HLN is available to approximately 91.1 million households (94.9 percent of pay television subscribers) in the United States, making it the most distributed American subscription network.",
