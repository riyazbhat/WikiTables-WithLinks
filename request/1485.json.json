  "/wiki/L%27Africaine": "L'Africaine (The African Woman) is a grand opera in five acts, the last work of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. The French libretto by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe deals with fictitious events in the life of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. Meyerbeer began working on the libretto using the title L'Africaine, although his working title for the opera was Vasco de Gama at the time of his death in 1864, before he had prepared a final version. The opera had its first performance in a version made by Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis at the Paris Op\u00e9ra (Salle Le Peletier) on 28 April 1865. This version has been generally used, but some recent productions have used versions which reconstitute elements from Meyerbeer's manuscript score and libretto.",
  "/wiki/Giacomo_Meyerbeer": "Giacomo Meyerbeer[n 1] (born Jacob Liebmann Beer; 5 September 1791 \u2013 2 May 1864) was a German opera composer of Jewish birth who has been described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century. With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera 'decisive character'. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century.",
