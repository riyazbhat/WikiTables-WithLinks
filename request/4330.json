  "/wiki/Philippine_Basketball_Association_Most_Valuable_Player_award": "The Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player (MVP) is an annual Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) award given since the start of the league in 1975 to the best performing player of the season. The award is decided using criteria introduced since the 2011\u201312 season, which include accumulated statistical points, votes from media, players and the league's Commissioner's Office. As of April 2019[update], the current holder of the award is June Mar Fajardo, his fifth consecutive MVP award since 2014.\n Note that the league's seasons have three tournaments (or conferences), so the regular NBA application of having a regular season MVP and a Finals MVP and the meaning of conference does not apply here. The season MVP is for the whole season, including the regular season, the playoffs and the Finals of each Conference, although there is a Best Player of the Conference award for each conference, and a Best Import award for conferences where imports are allowed to play.\n June Mar Fajardo won the award a record five times from 2013\u201314 to 2017\u201318, while both Ramon Fernandez and Alvin Patrimonio won the award four times. Benjie Paras remains the only rookie to have ever won the award to date, which he did during the 1989 season.\n As with the other annual awards given by the league, the winner receives The Leo Trophy, which is named in honor of Leo Prieto, the first commissioner of the PBA who served from 1975 until his retirement in 1983.",
