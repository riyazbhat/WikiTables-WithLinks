The short is notable for the first appearance of Yosemite Sam, as well as the first short to credit (almost) the whole animation staff who worked on the short (previously, shorts credited the director, one animator, writer, musical director and sometimes the voice actor).\n The shorts also the first to use the shortened version of  Merrily We Roll Along that played from 1945, to 1955.",
  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character, created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros. Cartoons) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc. Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky's Hare Hunt (1938) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts, the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare (1940).\n Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catch phrase \"Eh...What's up, doc?\". Due to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment, but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world. He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos.\n Since his debut, Bugs has appeared in various short films, feature films, compilations, TV series, music records, comics, video games, award shows, amusement park rides, and commercials. He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character, is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world, and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",

His name is taken from Yosemite National Park. Along with Elmer Fudd, he is an adversary of Bugs Bunny. He is commonly depicted as an extremely aggressive gunslinging prospector, outlaw, pirate, or cowboy with a hair-trigger temper and an intense hatred of rabbits, Bugs in particular. In cartoons with non-Western themes, he uses various aliases, including \"Chilkoot Sam\" (named for the Chilkoot Trail; Sam pronounces it \"Chilli-koot\") and  \"Square-deal Sam\" in 14 Carrot Rabbit, \"Riff Raff Sam\" in Sahara Hare, \"Sam Schultz\" in Big House Bunny, \"Seagoin' Sam\" in Buccaneer Bunny, \"Shanghai Sam\" in Mutiny on the Bunny, and \"Von Schamm the Hessian\" in Bunker Hill Bunny and many others.

Freleng, was an American animator, cartoonist, director, producer, and composer known for his work at Warner Bros. Cartoons on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons.\n He introduced and/or developed several of the studio's biggest stars, including Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Tweety, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam (to whom he was said to bear more than a passing resemblance), and Speedy Gonzales. The senior director at Warners' Termite Terrace studio, Freleng directed more cartoons than any other director in the studio (a total of 266), and is also the most honored of the Warner directors, having won five Academy Awards and three Emmy Awards[disputed  \u2013 discuss]. After Warners closed down the animation studio in 1963, Freleng and business partner David H. DePatie founded DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises, which produced cartoons (including The Pink Panther Show), feature film title sequences, and Saturday-morning cartoons through the early 1980s.\n The nickname \"Friz\" came from his friend, Hugh Harman, who initially nicknamed him \"Congressman Frizby\" after a fictional senator who appeared in satirical pieces in the Los Angeles Examiner. Over time, this shortened to \"Friz\".",

  "/wiki/Daffy_Duck": "Daffy Duck is an animated cartoon character produced by Warner Bros. Styled as an anthropomorphic black duck, the character has appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, in which he usually has been depicted as a foil for Bugs Bunny. Daffy was one of the first of the new \"screwball\" characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier during the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye.\n Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 167 appearances and Porky Pig's 162 appearances. Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character. Directors such as Bob Clampett, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones are notable examples of the character.\n Daffy was number 14 on TV Guide's list of top 50 greatest cartoon characters.",

He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself). His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a \"scwewy wabbit\". Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \"Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\", as well as his trademark laughter.\n The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones' work What's Opera, Doc? (one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs, though he felt bad about it), the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville, and the \"Hunting Trilogy\" of \"Rabbit Season/Duck Season\" shorts (Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) with Fudd, Bugs Bunny, and Daffy Duck. An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer's aspects before the character's more conspicuous features were set.",

Coyote and the Road Runner, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew, Porky Pig, Michigan J. Frog, the Three Bears, and a slew of other Warner characters.\n After his career at Warner Bros. ended in 1962, Jones started Sib Tower 12 Productions, and began producing cartoons for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, including a new series of Tom and Jerry shorts and the television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. He later started his own studio, Chuck Jones Enterprises, which created several one-shot specials, and periodically worked on Looney Tunes related works.\n Jones was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning three times. He won for the cartoons For Scent-imental Reasons, So Much for So Little, and The Dot and the Line. Robin Williams presented Jones with an Honorary Academy Award in 1996 for his iconic work in the animation industry. Film historian Leonard Maltin has praised Jones' work at Warner Bros., MGM and Chuck Jones Enterprises. He also said that the \"feud\" that there may have been between Jones and colleague Bob Clampett was mainly because they were so different from each other. In Jerry Beck's The 50 Greatest Cartoons, ten of the entries were directed by Jones, with four out of the five top cartoons (including first place) being Jones shorts.",

It was reissued as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies cartoon, retitled Birth of a Notion, with the ending theme song still being that of the Looney Tunes cartoon.  It features Daffy Duck, as well as a dog named Leopold and an unnamed mad scientist. Director Robert McKimson used his \"Barnyard Dawg\" character design as Leopold, while the scientist is a caricature, both visually and vocally, of Peter Lorre. The title is a play on The Birth of a Nation, but there is no other connection to that 1915 film.\n The Birth of a Notion is one of three shorts that had been scheduled for direction by Bob Clampett before he left Warner Bros. Cartoons; the other two were Bacall to Arms and The Goofy Gophers, both of which were finished by Arthur Davis.

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character. Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles.\n He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, \"Th-th-th-that's all folks!\" This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. In contrast, the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan: So Long, Folks! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series (when Bugs Bunny was the closing character, he would break the pattern by simply saying, in his Brooklynese accent, \"And Dat's De End!\"). He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character.\n Porky's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, \"What's going on?\" might become \"What's guh-guh-guh-guh\u2014...what's happening?\" Porky's age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in Porky's Preview), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years. In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons, Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head, and his attempt to close the show with \"The End\" becomes \"Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks!\" Porky Pig would appear in 153 cartoons in the Golden age of American animation.",

Coyote (also known simply as \"the Coyote\") and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. In each episode, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) to try to catch his prey, which backfire comically, with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme.\n One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff. After he goes over the edge, the rest of the scene, shot from a bird's-eye view, shows him falling into a canyon so deep, that his figure is eventually lost to sight. This is followed, a second or two later, by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits.\n Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name. The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus, Velocitus tremenjus, Birdibus zippibus, Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius. Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius, Eatius birdius, Overconfidentii vulgaris, Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex. \n The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons just like Tom and Jerry, but became popular in its own right.\n The Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: Operation: Rabbit, To Hare Is Human, Rabbit's Feat, Compressed Hare, and Hare-Breadth Hurry. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for Hare-Breadth Hurry), beginning with 1952's Operation: Rabbit, introducing himself as \"Wile E. Coyote\u2014Genius\", voiced with an upper-class accent by Mel Blanc. The Road Runner vocalizes only with a signature sound, \"Beep, Beep\", recorded by Paul Julian (although some viewers claim it sounds more like \"meep meep\"), and an accompanying \"popping-cork\" tongue noise.\n To date, 49 cartoons have been made featuring these characters (including the four CGI shorts), the majority by Chuck Jones.\n TV Guide included Wile E.

Like Volumes 3, 4, and 5, it has a warning before each disc about the shorts containing content that some viewers would not consider to be \"politically correct\" by today's standards (but will be shown uncut and uncensored for historical reasons), and as such, is \"intended for the adult collector\". However, Volume 6's disclaimer states that it \"is not suitable for children\", as opposed to Volumes 3-5 stating that they \"may not be suitable for children\". This is due to that in addition to containing cartoons that have racial and/or ethnic stereotypes (like in Volumes 3, 4, and 5) and references to sexism in Robert McKimson's Wild Wife, Volume 6 also contains many cartoons that pertain to World War II, most of them containing depictions or references to Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo or to Nazis and Imperial Japan in general. While Volumes 4 and 5 each had a couple explicitly WWII themed cartoons (Plane Daffy and Scrap Happy Daffy, respectively), Volume 6 is notable for having an entire disc dedicated to the subject (Disc 2: Patriotic Pals), including several of its bonus cartoons.\n Volume 6 was originally only released in North America due to the poor sales of Volume 5. However, the discs in this volume were not region-coded, making it easy for collectors outside of North America to import and play this set. The set was released in the UK on 12 September 2011."
