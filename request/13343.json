  "/wiki/Schnellboot": "E-boat was the Western Allies' designation for the fast attack craft (German: Schnellboot, or S-Boot, meaning fast boat) of the Kriegsmarine during World War II.

Within the navy officers of this rank were simply addressed as Herr Oberleutnant. To distinguish naval officers from those of the army, the suffix zur See (at sea) was added in official communications, sometimes shortened to z.S. (Oblt.z.S.). The rank has since been used by the Reichsmarine, Kriegsmarine, and Bundesmarine. In the Volksmarine the rank was originally used in the same way until the suffix zur See was dropped. In the Kriegsmarine engineers (Ingenieur - Ing.) of the same rank were distinguished as Oberleutnant (Ing. ).",

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry.
