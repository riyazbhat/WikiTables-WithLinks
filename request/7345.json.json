Hari refers to God who takes away all the sorrows of his devotees. In the Rigveda\u2019s Purusha Suktam (Praise of the supreme cosmic Being), Hari is the first and most important name of God ( whose Sanskrit cognate is Brahman), an alternative name of the supreme Being is Narayana after Hari and Purusha according to Narayana Suktam of  theYajurveda. Within the Hindu tradition, it is often used interchangeably with Vishnu to such an extent that they are considered to be one and the same. In the Vedas, it is required to use the mantra \"Harih om\" before any recitation, just to declare that every ritual we perform is an offering to that supreme Divine Being; even if the hymn praises some one or the other demigods. The idea of demigods as found in Hinduism is very different from that found within Greco-Roman mythology. This has to be borne in mind while understanding how, within Hinduism, all beings including demigods are inseparable from Hari. The phrase \"Harih Om\" gestures towards Advaita Vedanta and other categories of non-dual thinking. \"Harih Om\" is akin to saying that all creation that we can see is in fact, a mirroring of the One Self. This is not the concept of mimesis as found in Western philosophy.",
