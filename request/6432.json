  "/wiki/A%27a_Village_(AS-34-33)": "The A'a Village Site, designated \"AS-34-33\" by archaeologists, is an abandoned village site on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa.  Located on a bay (nearly inaccessible by land) on the northwest coast of the island, the site was first surveyed by professional archaeologists in 1985.  The site has four distinct areas, in which features interpreted as house foundations have been located, as have rock walls, grave sites, and platform mounds.  The site was not known to be occupied within the living memory of nearby residents, and the size of trees in the site suggests it has been abandoned since the 1860s.",

  "/wiki/Atauloma_Girls_School": "The Atauloma Girls School is a historic parochial school building in Afao village on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa. The London Missionary Society opened it in 1900 as the second secondary school on Tutuila (after the Fagalele Boys School), and the first to admit girls. For most of its history it prepared girls primarily to be pastors' wives, and after 1913 provided graduates to the nursing school at the naval station at Pago Pago. Its establishment saved Tutuila girls the necessity of travel to Upolu for secondary school, which separated them from their families and exposed them to the dangers of the international port at Apia. Atauloma was abandoned by 1970.",
  "/wiki/Fagalele_Boys_School": "The Fagalele Boys School, in Leone, American Samoa, is a historic building that was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  It is a church school built by the London Missionary Society, perhaps as early as 1850-1856, but before 1900.  It was the first secondary school in what is now American Samoa, and it perhaps is the oldest surviving building on Tutuila Island.",
  "/wiki/Leone,_American_Samoa": "Leone is a village on the south-west coast of Tutuila Island, American Samoa. Leone was the ancient capital of Tutuila Island. Leone was also where the Samoan Islands\u2019 first missionary, John Williams, visited on October 18, 1832. A monument in honor of Williams has been erected in front of Zion Church. Its large church was the first to be built in American Samoa. It has three towers, a carved ceiling and stained glass. Until steamships were invented, Leone was the preferred anchorage of sailing ships which did not risk entering Pago Pago Harbor. Much early contact between Samoans and Europeans took place in Leone.",
  "/wiki/Fagatele_Bay_Site": "The Fagatele Bay Site is an archaeological site on the shore of Fagatele Bay on the south side of Tutuila, the main island of the United States territory of American Samoa.  The site shows evidence of habitation from prehistoric to historic times, and is well preserved in part because of the relative difficulty of land access to the area.  It has ten distinct features, including raised platforms, stone walls, and a stone-line path.  In one feature, interpreted as a house site, a complete prehistoric-era adze was found.  When surveyed in 1985, these features could not be chronologically organized or correlated.",

The archaeologically sensitive site includes a variety of stone features, principally stone fences and retaining walls, with evidence from excavation of human habitation.  Radiocarbon dating from one of its test pits yielded a date range of CE 550-1000, identifying the site as one of the oldest known on the island.  According to oral tradition, the Maloata area was reserved for use by relatively high-status chieftains.",
  "/wiki/Poloa_Defensive_Fortifications": "The Poloa Defensive Fortifications are a set of historic military structures on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa. Consisting of three concrete pillboxes along the beach, these fortifications were built by American Marines as part of a system of defenses against a feared Japanese amphibious invasion of Samoa during the early part of World War II. The Poloa pillboxes stand out from other emplacements on Tutuila for their relatively less robust construction, possibly reflecting American tactical planning for greater defense in depth at this location. The threat of invasion eased by late 1942, and the fortifications never saw combat.",

Set on sloping ground, the top of the wall is roughly level, and is only 2.8 metres (9.2\u00a0ft) high at the upper end of the slope.  Platforms and other features have been identified during archaeological examination of the structure and its surroundings in the 1990s.

Located in an upland area on the western side of the island above the village of Leone, the complex consists of a series of basalt quarries and structures that archaeologists have interpreted as having a military defensive purpose.  The site has been known since at least 1927, and was first formally surveyed in the 1960s.  Features of the site include extraction pits, from which basalt was quarried for the manufacture of stone tools and weapons, as well as domestic features such as grinding stones.  Archaeologists in 1985 noted that some of the sites features were, including trenches and terracing, were made in areas that were unsuitable for the production of stone tools, and closely resemble known military defensive structures in other areas of the Samoan islands.  The site extends along a network of ridges for more than 1.4 kilometres (0.87\u00a0mi).  Radiocarbon dating of elements of site indicate periods of occupation and/or use from c. 200 CE to the period of European contact.",
