The C\u00f4te d'Ivoire became the first sub-Saharan African country to submit a film to the competition, and it ended up winning the Oscar for the dark comedy Black and White in Color. It is likely the film would not have even been accepted under today's rules, since the director was French and the film was a majority French production. The Ivorians have submitted just one film for the Foreign Language Oscar since, Run, which was submitted for the 88th Academy Awards but was not nominated."
