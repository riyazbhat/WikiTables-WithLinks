GTRI employs around 2,400 people, and is involved in approximately $600 million in research annually for more than 200 clients in industry and government. Initially known as the Engineering Experiment Station, (EES) the organization was proposed in 1929 by W. Harry Vaughan as an analogue to the agricultural experiment stations; the Georgia General Assembly passed a law that year creating the organization on paper, but did not allocate funds to start it. To boost the state's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression, funds were found, and the station was finally established with US$5,000 (equivalent to $80,000 in 2018) in April 1934. GTRI's research spans a variety of disciplines, including national defense, homeland security, public health, education, mobile and wireless technologies, and economic development. Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies, the state of Georgia, non-defense federal agencies, and private industry. Overall, contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI's total research funding. Since it was established, GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science, economics, policy, and other areas that leverage GTRI's partnership with Georgia Tech.",

The best known of his 85 patents is the Coulter principle, which provides a method for counting and sizing microscopic particles suspended in fluid. His invention of the Coulter Counter made possible today's most common medical diagnostic test: the complete blood count (CBC).  The Coulter principle is used in quality control of consumer products, such as chocolate and beer, paint and toners, and was even used to analyze moon dust.\n Recognized as one of the most influential inventors of the twentieth century, Wallace Coulter studied electronics as a student at Georgia Tech in the early 1930s. Mr. Coulter developed the \"Coulter Principle,\" a theory that gave birth to both the automated hematology industry and the field of industrial fine particle counting. His \"Coulter Counter,\" a blood cell analyzer, is used to perform one of medicine's most often-requested and informative diagnostic tests, the complete blood count.",

  "/wiki/Truss_connector_plate": "A truss connector plate, or gang plate, is a kind of tie. Truss plates are light gauge metal plates used to connect prefabricated light frame wood trusses. They are produced by punching light gauge galvanized steel to create teeth on one side. The teeth are embedded in and hold the wooden frame components to the plate and each other. Nail plates are used to connect timber of the same thickness in the same plane. When used on trusses, they are pressed into the side of the timber using tools such as a hydraulic press or a roller. As the plate is pressed in, the teeth are all driven into the wood fibers simultaneously, and the compression between adjacent teeth reduces the tendency of the wood to split. A truss connector plate is manufactured from ASTM A653/A653M, A591, A792/A792M, or A167 structural quality steel and is protected with zinc or zinc-aluminum alloy coatings or their stainless steel equivalent.",

The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability. To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  controllability and observability. This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries.
