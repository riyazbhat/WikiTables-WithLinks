  "/wiki/Altair_Campground_Community_Kitchen": "The Altair Campground Community Kitchen, also known as Altaire Campground Community Kitchen, was built in Olympic National Park to serve the Altair Campground. It is an open rectangular shelter built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps personnel from the Elwha River Camp in the National Park Service Rustic style. Located near the Elwha River, the peeled log structure is capped with a cedar shake roof, enclosing a cooking fireplace and chimney. It measures about 28 feet (8.5 m) by 17 feet (5.2 m), with a stone cooking fireplace in the middle, rising through the roof. The lower portions of the log columns have been replaced with concrete piers due to deterioration, and the original peeled log railings have disappeared. The Altair and Elwha Campground Community Kitchens are the only such structures remaining in Olympic National Park. The Altair campground was named after the USS Altair, whose crew regularly used the site in the 1920s and 1930s.

  "/wiki/Elwha_River": "The Elwha River is a 45-mile (72 km) river on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. From its source at Elwha snowfinger in the Olympic Mountains, it flows generally north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Most of the river's course is within the Olympic National Park. The Elwha is one several rivers in the Pacific Northwest that hosts all five species of native Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, chum, sockeye, and pink salmon), plus four anadromous trout species (steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, bull trout, and Dolly Varden char). From 1911 to 2014, dams blocked fish passage on the lower Elwha River. Before the dams, 400,000 adult salmon returned yearly to spawn in 70 miles (110 km) of river habitat. Prior to dam removal, fewer than 4,000 salmon returned each year in only 4.9 miles (7.9 km) of habitat below the lower dam. The National Park Service removed the two dams as part of the $325 million Elwha Ecosystem Restoration Project.",

  "/wiki/Botten_Cabin": "The Botten Cabin, also known as the Wilder Patrol Cabin, was built in 1929 in the Elwha River valley for Henry H. Botten. The hunting cabin is located in the backcountry of what in 1938 became Olympic National Park in the U.S. state of Washington. The remote cabin was built by local settler Grant Humes for Botten, who used it until his death in 1953. Botten's widow continued to apply for special use permits into the 1960s.

  "/wiki/Elwha_Ranger_Station": "The Elwha Ranger Station is a historic district in Olympic National Park, originally built in the 1930s for the U.S. Forest Service.

The complex was turned over to the National Park Service in 1940 when the land was added to Olympic National Park from Olympic National Forest. Construction is typical of USFS practice, and reflects the Forest Service's preference of the time for bungalow and American Craftsman style architecture. The Elwha area was designated as one of fifteen areas in Olympic National Forest to be used for public recreation. The Cleator Plan, named after Forest Service recreation engineer Fred W. Cleator, envisioned the construction of appropriate structures to support these activities, including a ranger station. In the mid-1930s a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established nearby, contributing labor for forest construction projects.",

It was a popular destination for hikers and horse tours through the 1940s. In 1943, the chalet was closed as an accommodation. It was used for a short period as an Aircraft Warning Service station during World War II, watching for Japanese airplanes.

  "/wiki/Humes_Ranch_Cabin": "The Humes Ranch cabin was built around the year 1900 by William Humes.  William Humes was originally from New York and arrived in the Elwha River area en route to the Klondike.  William, his brother, and a cousin liked the area so much they set up homestead sites.  In the early 1940s, Herb Crisler settled into the cabin at Humes Ranch with his bride, Lois, while they filmed wildlife for what became Walt Disney's Olympic Elk film.  Since acquiring the property from Peninsula Plywood, the National Park Service has restored the cabin, conforming to its original appearance and with much of the original materials. Wood deterioration, however, is occurring, as a result of the moist Olympic Peninsula environment.\n The cabin is accessible via the Geyser Valley trail, approximately 3 miles from Whiskey Bend Trailhead and 1.3 miles from Goblins Gate. Just beyond the cabin lie Humes' old fields and then the trail continues for less than 0.5 miles to Dodger point bridge and the Grand Canyon of the Elwha.",
