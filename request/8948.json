The distance from 'the point' to 'the pier' at Chicama is about 2.2\u00a0km, which locals confirm has been ridden on a single wave, although the whole cape upon which the waves break, to their most westernmost end, is 4\u00a0km long. Although other waves break further up the cape from the main section of \"the point\", (including \"Malpaso\" (up to a few hundred metres) and \"Keys\" (up to 600m or so) apparently nobody has ridden a single wave the length of the whole 4\u00a0km cape at Chicama, as deep water does not allow a single ride along the length of the first 1.8\u00a0km or so.",
