  "/wiki/Impact_Zone": "The Impact Zone, also known as the Impact Wrestling Zone, is the professional wrestling nickname for any one of three sound stages at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. Its nickname was derived from Impact!, a weekly television series produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling) which broadcast from this venue. Between 2004 and March 2013, TNA taped their broadcasts from Soundstage 21. As part of the agreement with Universal, TNA was not allowed to charge general admission to events held at the Impact Zone, with the exception of VIP packages. This meant the company sometimes looked for alternative venues to host their large pay-per-view events. After March 2013, TNA left Universal Studios and began to tour nationally. TNA returned to Universal Studios on November 21, 2013, using Soundstage 19, which is smaller and holds fewer people than Soundstage 21. Until April 2018, the company continued to tape most of its programming at Universal Studios, with occasional tapings at other venues, switching between Soundstages 19, 20, and 21."
