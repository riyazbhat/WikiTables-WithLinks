The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into the New World. The high Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish, French, and the English as Memphis took shape. Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans: John Overton, James Winchester, and future president Andrew Jackson. Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods, natural resources like lumber, and the American slave trade. After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton and lumber.

  "/wiki/Guido_Kratschmer": "Guido Kratschmer (born 10 January 1953 in Klotzenhof, West Germany) is a retired West German decathlete. His sports club was the USC Mainz. Kratschmer competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, where he won the silver medal in the men's decathlon event. He could not participate at the 1980 Summer Olympics because of the boycott. In 1980, Kratschmer broke the world record held by Daley Thompson, but in 1982, Kratschmer's mark was in turn topped by Thompson. Kratschmer's personal best total in the decathlon was 8667 points, achieved in June 1980 in Bernhausen, West Germany. This total ranks him sixth all-time among German decathletes, behind J\u00fcrgen Hingsen, Uwe Freimuth, Siegfried Wentz, Frank Busemann and Torsten Voss.",

It is located northwest of D\u00fcsseldorf, its centre lying just a few kilometres to the west of the river Rhine; the borough of Uerdingen is situated directly on the Rhine. Because of its economic past, Krefeld is often referred to as the Velvet and Silk City. It is accessed by the autobahns A57 (Cologne-Nijmegen) and A44 (Aachen-D\u00fcsseldorf-Dortmund-Kassel). Krefeld's residents speak Hochdeutsch, or standard German, but the native dialect is a Low German variety, sometimes locally called Krefelder Plattdeutsch, Krieewelsch Platt, Plattdeutsch, or sometimes simply Platt. The Uerdingen line isogloss, separating general dialectical areas in Germany and neighboring Germanic-speaking countries, runs through and is named after Krefeld's Uerdingen district, originally an independent municipality."
