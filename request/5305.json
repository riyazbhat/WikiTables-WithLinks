While still supporting expected x86 syntax, A86 allows the use of slightly simpler shorthand in some cases. It also does not require the use of directives, such as ASSUME and PROC, as do Microsoft Macro Assembler and other contemporaries. Isaacson claimed that A86 can assemble 100,000 lines of source per second on a Pentium II or better. It comes with a debugger, D86.",

Some assemblers are components of a compiler system for a high level language and may have limited or no usable functionality outside of the compiler system.  Some assemblers are hosted on the target processor and operating system, while other assemblers (cross-assemblers) may run under  an unrelated operating system or processor.  For example, assemblers for embedded systems are not usually hosted on the target system since it would not have the storage and terminal I/O to permit entry of a program from a keyboard. An assembler may have a single target processor or may have options to support multiple processor types. Very simple assemblers may lack features, such as macros, present in more powerful versions."
