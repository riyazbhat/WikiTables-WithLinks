  "/wiki/NY_10": "New York State Route\u00a010 (NY\u00a010) is a north\u2013south state highway in the Central New York and North Country regions of New York in the United States. It extends for 155 miles (249\u00a0km) from the Quickway (NY\u00a017) (Future Interstate 86 {I-86}) in Deposit, Delaware County to NY\u00a08 at Higgins Bay, a hamlet in the Hamilton County town of Arietta. NY\u00a010 formally began concurrent with NY\u00a08, until NY\u00a08 was truncated to end at the northern end of the overlap by 2017. While NY\u00a08 follows a more westerly alignment between Deposit and Higgins Bay via Utica, NY\u00a010 veers to the east, serving Delhi, Cobleskill, and Canajoharie. Along the way, the road intersects Interstate\u00a088 (I-88) near Cobleskill and U.S. Route\u00a020 (US\u00a020) in Sharon Springs.\n NY\u00a010 was assigned in 1924; however, it initially followed a completely different alignment than it does today. At the time, it began at the New Jersey state line in Rockland County and followed modern US\u00a09W north to Albany. From here, it continued to Saranac Lake via Schenectady, Saratoga Springs, Lake George, Chestertown, North Creek, Long Lake, and Tupper Lake. It was extended northeast to Plattsburgh by 1926 but truncated to Schenectady in 1927. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, all of NY\u00a010 south of Long Lake and north of Lake Clear Junction was moved onto a new, more westerly alignment through the state. The route was cut back to its current northern terminus in Arietta c.\u20091960.",

  "/wiki/NY_5": "New York State Route\u00a05 (NY\u00a05) is a state highway that extends for 370.80 miles (596.74\u00a0km) across the state of New York in the United States. It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the Chautauqua County town of Ripley and passes through Buffalo, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady, and several other smaller cities and communities on its way to downtown Albany in Albany County, where it terminates at U.S. Route\u00a09 (US\u00a09), here routed along the service roads for Interstate\u00a0787 (I-787). Prior to the construction of the New York State Thruway, it was one of two main east\u2013west highways traversing upstate New York, the other being US\u00a020. West of New York, NY\u00a05 continues as Pennsylvania Route\u00a05 (PA\u00a05) to Erie.\n NY\u00a05 overlaps with US\u00a020 twice along its routing. The second, a 68-mile (109\u00a0km) overlap through western and central New York, is the second-longest concurrency in the state, stretching from Avon east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County. The concurrency is known locally as \"Routes 5 and 20\". As the route proceeds across the state, it also directly or indirectly meets every major north\u2013south highway in upstate New York, including all three north\u2013south Interstate Highways (I-390 in Avon, I-81 in Syracuse via US\u00a011, and I-87 in Albany).\n NY\u00a05 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross-state highway, extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east, mostly by way of modern US\u00a020. At the time, modern NY\u00a05 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route\u00a05A. By 1926, NY\u00a05 was moved onto the routing of NY\u00a05A while the old routing of NY\u00a05 became NY\u00a07. It was truncated in 1927 to Athol Springs in the west and Albany in the east following the assignment of US\u00a020, and again in 1930 to downtown Buffalo. NY\u00a05 was reextended to the Pennsylvania state line c.\u20091932 by way of its old routing to Athol Springs, an old alignment of US\u00a020, and a lakeside spur route of US\u00a020 that had been assigned in 1930.

Reference markers indicate its terminus in Fort Plain to be its western, although the route heads nearly due southward until Sprout Brook. Approaching that hamlet, it is named Cherry Valley Road, and when NY\u00a0163 turns left to head eastward, County Route\u00a082 (CR\u00a082) continues that road name directly to NY\u00a0166 which leads to Cherry Valley.
