  "/wiki/Jordi_Cruyff": "Johan Jordi Cruijff (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8jo\u02d0\u0266\u0251n \u02c8j\u0254rdi kr\u0153yf], anglicised to Cruyff; born 9 February 1974) is a Dutch football coach and former player. Cruyff is the son of former player and manager Johan Cruyff. He is the head coach of the Ecuador national football team. \n As a footballer, he played from 1992 through to 2010, including periods with Barcelona and Manchester United. He earned nine caps for the Netherlands national football team, playing at UEFA Euro 1996, and he won the Premier League title in 1997 while at United.\n Jordi played mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he could also perform as a second striker. In his later years, notably with Metalurh Donetsk, he also played as a centre back. After starting his career with Barcelona and playing for the Netherlands aged 22, Cruyff's career stalled while at Manchester United, as he appeared just 36 times in the league over four years largely because of injuries. His most successful period was arguably with Deportivo Alav\u00e9s, which he led to the 2001 UEFA Cup Final. He also played for Celta Vigo, RCD Espanyol and finished his playing career with Valletta in the Maltese Premier League.\n Under his stewardship as Maccabi Tel Aviv's sporting director, the club became a dominant force in Israeli football. The team won consecutive league titles from 2012\u20132015, as well as regularly qualifying for the Europa League and Champions League.",
