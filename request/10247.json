Ships were built in the harbor mainly between 1818 and the 1870s, at which point demand declined dramatically. Meanwhile, the Royal River's four waterfalls within Yarmouth, whose Main Street sits about 90 feet above sea level, resulted in the foundation of almost sixty mills between 1674 and 1931. The annual Yarmouth Clam Festival attracts around 120,000 people (around fourteen times its population) over the course of the three-day weekend. Today, Yarmouth is a popular dining destination, with (as of September 2019) fourteen sit-down restaurants. This equates to an average of just over one restaurant per square mile of land area."
