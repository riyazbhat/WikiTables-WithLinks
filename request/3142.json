It is located in the Sierra Nevada foothills, 8 miles (13 km) east of Jackson. The park is nestled in a little valley 2,400 feet (732 m) above sea level, with open meadows and large specimens of valley oak that once provided the Miwok peoples of this area with an ample supply of acorns.  The 135-acre (55 ha) park was established in 1962 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n The native name for the site is \"Chaw\u2019se\", the Miwok word for \"grinding rock\". Upon this rock they ground acorns and other seeds into meal, slowly forming the cup-shaped depressions in the stone, which can still be seen today. Along with the mortar holes, the main grinding rock within the park features a number of petroglyphs: circles, spoked wheels, animal and human tracks, wavy lines, etc. Some of these carvings are thought to be as much as two or three thousand years old and are now becoming difficult to discern. This association of rock art and bedrock mortar pits is unique in California. Except for one other small site, Chaw'se has the only known occurrence of mortars intentionally decorated with petroglyphs.",

The original wine cellar is registered as a California Historical Landmark.\n It is the third-oldest winery in the state, started in 1856 by Adam Uhlinger, a Swiss immigrant, who brought grapevines with him from Europe to Amador County. It was thought to be the first place where Zinfandel was planted in California, but later research has shown that many people were involved in bringing Zinfandel to California and that it is impossible to determine who truly was first. It is, however, the oldest in the state to continuously make Zinfandel and some of the original vines are even still in production.\n In 1911, the winery and its 125 acres (0.51 km2) of vineyard were purchased by Enrico D'Agostini, whom the winery is now named after. Armagan Champagne Cellars purchased the business in 1984, and the Amador County vineyard and wine cellar were sold to the Sobon family in 1989. Thus, bottles sold under the D'Agostini label are produced by Armagan, but wine produced from the original vines comes from Sobon.\n The original wine cellar, with walls made from rock quarried from nearby hills, hand-hewn beams, and oak casks, is still standing and is now part of the Shenandoah Valley Museum, which displays agriculture and wine artifacts.",

It closed in 1942 and together with nearby Argonaut Mine, is registered as California Historical Landmark No. 786. It has since been re-opened as a tourist attraction.\n The mine is named for Andrew Kennedy, an Irish immigrant, who reportedly discovered a quartz outcropping in the late 1850s near what is now State Route 49. The Kennedy Mining Company was formed in 1860 when he and three partners began digging shafts near today's mine property entrance. The mine operated sporadically until it closed in 1878. In 1886 fifteen people invested $97,600 to reopen the mine under the corporate entity of the Kennedy Mining and Milling Company.\n In 1898 the company began sinking a new shaft 1,950 feet (591 m) east of the original shafts. This East Shaft would eventually reach a vertical depth of 5,912 feet (1,792 m), the deepest vertical depth gold mine in North America at the time. In 1928 a surface fire burned all the structures except two.  All other buildings and foundations were built after 1928. The company operated the mine until 1942 when the U.S. Government closed gold mines because of the war effort.\n On August 27, 1922, when forty-seven miners were trapped by fire in the nearby Argonaut Mine 4,650 feet (1,409 m) below ground, rescue efforts were launched from the Kennedy Mine to connect the tunnels of the two mines.  Unfortunately progress was slow and rescuers arrived too late to save the miners in the Argonaut.\n At the time of its closing, the mine had produced some $34.3 million (according to the California Department of Conservation) when gold was valued at $20.67 and $35.00 per ounce. The company paid its stockholders $5.8 million between 1886 and 1937. Over 95% of these dividends were paid at $20.67 per ounce.",
