WWLP operates a full-time low-power digital repeater, WFXQ-CD (UHF channel 28, also mapped to virtual channel 22 via PSIP), whose transmitter is located at the top of the old Mount Tom Ski Area in Holyoke. WFXQ-CD allows viewers in the core of the Springfield market UHF access to WWLP's signal, as VHF antennas have some issues with reception in the digital age, and with all other Springfield stations carried on UHF channels, it allows those viewers to use one type of antenna rather than two. Due to the close proximity of the Springfield\u2013Holyoke and Hartford\u2013New Haven markets, many stations in Connecticut can be viewed in the Southern Pioneer Valley. Since WWLP's transmitter on Provin Mountain is not far from the state line, its signal can be picked up in northern areas of the state.
