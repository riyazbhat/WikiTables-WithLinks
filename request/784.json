  "/wiki/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP": "The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 23, 2000 by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. It was recorded over a two-month period in several studios in the Detroit area, and during this time, Eminem felt significant pressure to improve upon the success of his previous record. Released a year after Eminem's breakout album The Slim Shady LP, the album features more introspective lyricism including his response to his sudden rise to fame and controversy surrounding his lyrics. Musically, the album incorporates hardcore hip hop and horrorcore.\n The Marshall Mathers LP debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 1.78 million copies in its first week alone which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. It also reached number one in eleven other countries. The Marshall Mathers LP's first single \"The Real Slim Shady\" became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The song and its video both poke fun at pop culture figures at the time such as NSYNC, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. The album also features \"Stan\", which has been regarded as one of Eminem's signature songs.\n Like The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release. Criticism centered around lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing Eminem's entry into the country. The Marshall Mathers LP has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the sequel to the album, was released in 2013.\n Despite the controversy of The Marshall Mathers LP, the record received acclaim from critics, who praised Eminem's lyrical ability and emotional depth. One of the most ground breaking albums in American music, The Marshall Mathers LP has been named on several lists of the greatest albums of all time. It is widely regarded as Eminem's magnum opus. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album and Best Rap Solo Performance (for \"The Real Slim Shady\") at the 43rd Grammy Awards. Due to its nominations at the ceremony, protests against the album's content reached a climax.",
