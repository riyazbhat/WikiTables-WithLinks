His political and cultural essays were published in The Nation, the New Statesman, the New York Review of Books, and Esquire magazines.

Hitchcock then cast him again in Strangers on a Train, as a tennis star drawn into a double murder plot by a wealthy psychopath, played by Robert Walker. Granger would describe this as his happiest film-making experience, and was deeply saddened by Walker's death shortly after shooting.
