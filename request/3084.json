  "/wiki/\u00c5ke_Seyffarth": "Karl \u00c5ke Seyffarth (15 January 1919 \u2013 1 January 1998) was  a Swedish speed skater who specialised in long distance events. He set new world records on the 5,000\u00a0m (8:13.7) in 1941 and on the 3000\u00a0m (4:45.7) in 1942. He became European Allround Champions in 1947, winning both the 5,000\u00a0m and the 10000\u00a0m on his way to becoming European Champion. In addition to speed skating, Seyffarth also was one of Sweden's leading cyclists, but this career was hampered by an injury in a dirt biking accident in 1943.\n Seyffarth participated in the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, the first Winter Olympic Games to be held in twelve years. As a result of the lack of competition during, and shortly after, World War II, Seyffarth entered the 5,000\u00a0m as the world record holder, a record he had set almost exactly seven years earlier, in 1941. During his heat, Seyffarth seemed to be winning until a photographer tried to take a picture of him and stepped onto the ice. Seyffarth brushed the photographer, losing several seconds, and went on to lose his heat and finally come in seventh overall. The winner of the race was Reidar Liaklev with a time of 8:29.4, well above Seyffarth's 1941 world record of 8:13.7. Seyffarth's official 5,000\u00a0m time was 8:37.9.\n The day after his disappointing 5000\u00a0m race, Seyffarth won Olympic silver on the 1,500\u00a0m, half a second behind Norwegian skater Sverre Farstad. The day after that, Seyffarth won Olympic gold on the 10000\u00a0m with a time of 17:26.30, not a particularly fast time considering that the world record at the time was 17:01.50. He won with relative ease, however, almost ten seconds ahead of silver medallist Lassi Parkkinen from Finland.",

Two weeks later, he participated in the World Allround Championships held in Helsinki, but his times on the first three distances were not good enough to qualify him for the final distance. The start of World War II meant that only very few tournaments were organised, so Hedlund could not compete very often during those years.\n When the war was over, Hedlund participated in the first European Allround Championships after the war and promptly became the 1946 European Allround Champion. There were no official World Allround Championships that year, but unofficial World Championships were held in Oslo and Hedlund won silver there. In 1947, Hedlund won European silver behind compatriot \u00c5ke Seyffarth. At the 1948 Winter Olympics of St. Moritz, Hedlund won bronze on the 5,000\u00a0m behind Norwegian skaters Reidar Liaklev and Odd Lundberg. His last international medal came two weeks later at the European Allround Championships where he won silver, again behind Liaklev.\n Hedlund competed internationally until 1952, when he finished in 9th\u201311th places in the 5,000\u201310,000 m events at the Winter Olympics. He died in Liding\u00f6 in 2003 at the age of 85. His daughter Ylva also became an Olympic speed skater.",
