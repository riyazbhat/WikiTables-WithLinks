The Mets won the series, four games to one, to accomplish one of the greatest upsets in Series history, as that particular Orioles team was considered to be one of the finest ever. The World Series win earned the team the sobriquet \"Miracle Mets\", as they had risen from the depths of mediocrity (the 1969 team had the first winning record in Mets history). This was the first World Series of MLB's divisional era.\n The Mets became the first expansion team to win a division title, a pennant, and the World Series, winning in their eighth year of existence, becoming the fastest expansion team to win a World Series up to that point. Two teams eventually surpassed the latter record, as the Florida Marlins won the 1997 World Series in their fifth year (also becoming the first wild card team to win a World Series) and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the 2001 World Series in their fourth year of play. The 1969 World Series was the first World Series since 1954 to have games played in New York that did not involve the New York Yankees; it was also the first World Series in which neither the New York Giants nor Brooklyn Dodgers (as both teams had moved to California in 1958) represented New York from the NL; all subsequent World Series with a New York-area NL team participating have involved the Mets, who have been the only NL baseball team located in New York City since that era.",

They lost at least one hundred games in five of the seasons.  However, they overcame mid-season difficulties while the division leaders for much of the season, the Chicago Cubs, suffered a late-season collapse.

This also was the last meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship until the Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers reached the NHL's 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, and also the last meeting between the Dodgers and the Yankees in the World Series to date (the two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, making it the most frequent matchup in World Series history).",

The Dodgers won the Western Division of the National League in the first half and advanced to the playoffs.

The Brewers made it by winning the AL East division by one game over the Baltimore Orioles, and then defeating the California Angels, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series. As of 2019, it is the Brewers' only World Series appearance.\n The Cardinals' victory helped the National League win four straight World Series from 1979 to 1982.  The National League would not again win even consecutive titles until the 2010 Giants, the 2011 Cardinals and the 2012 Giants.\n Though the teams had never met before, their home cities had a commercial rivalry in the beer market, as St. Louis is the home of Anheuser\u2013Busch, which owned the Cardinals at the time, while Milwaukee is the home of Miller Brewing and other past major competitors of Anheuser\u2013Busch.
