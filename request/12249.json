  "/wiki/Graduate_school": "A graduate school (sometimes shortened to grad school) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e., master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree with a high grade point average. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, speech-language pathology, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa. Many universities award graduate degrees; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution. While the term graduate school is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere (e.g., Canada), postgraduate education is also used in English-speaking countries (Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the UK) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor's degree. Those attending graduate schools are called graduate students (in both American and British English), or often in British English as postgraduate students and, colloquially, postgraduates and postgrads. Degrees awarded to graduate students include master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees. Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences.",
