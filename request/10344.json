  "/wiki/Barnes_Peacock": "Sir Barnes Peacock (1810 \u2013 3 December 1890) was an English judge. He was the first Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court in India.\n Peacock was the son of Lewis Peacock, a solicitor. After practising as a special pleader, he was called to the bar in 1836 by the Inner Temple, and joined the Home Circuit. In 1844 he obtained great reputation by pointing out the flaw which invalidated the conviction of Daniel O'Connell and his fellow defendants. He took silk in 1850, and was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple the same year.\n In 1852, Peacock went to India as a legal member of the Governor General's Council. The Legislative Council was established soon after his arrival, and although no orator, he was so frequent a speaker that legislation enjoining councillors to deliver their speeches sitting was said to have been devised with the sole object of restraining him. As a member of Lord Dalhousie's council he supported the annexation of Oudh, and he stood by Lord Canning all through the Indian Mutiny.\n In 1859 Peacock became the last Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, and was knighted. He was appointed as the first Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court on 1 July 1862. He returned to England in 1870 and in 1872 was appointed as a paid member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the court of last resort for the British Empire.",

  "/wiki/James_Hannen,_Baron_Hannen": "James Hannen, Baron Hannen, PC, FRS (19 March 1821 \u2013 29 March 1894) was an English judge.\n Son of a London merchant, he was born at Peckham. He was educated at St Paul's School and at Heidelberg University, which was famous as a school of law. Called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1848, he joined the home circuit. At this time he also wrote for the press, and supplied special reports for the Morning Chronicle. Though not eloquent in speech, he was clear, accurate and painstaking, and soon advanced in his profession, passing many more brilliant competitors. He appeared for the claimant in the Shrewsbury peerage case in 1858, when the 3rd Earl Talbot was declared to be entitled to the earldom of Shrewsbury as the descendant of the 2nd earl; was principal agent for Great Britain on the mixed British and American commission for the settlement of outstanding claims, 1853\u20131855; and assisted in the prosecution of the Fenian prisoners at Manchester.\n In 1868, Hannen was appointed a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. In many cases he took a strong position of his own, notably in that of Farrar v. Close (1869), which materially affected the legal status of trade unions and was regarded by unionists as a severe blow to their interests. Hannen became judge of the Court of Probate and Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in 1872. By virtue of being the Probate Judge, he became President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division by operation of the Judicature Acts when three courts became part of the new High Court of Justice. Here he showed himself a worthy successor to Cresswell and Penzance.\n Many important causes came before him, but he will chiefly be remembered for the manner in which he presided over the Parnell special commission. His influence pervaded the whole proceedings, and it is understood that he personally penned a large part of the voluminous report. Hannen's last public service was in connection with the Bering Sea inquiry at Paris, when he acted as one of the British arbitrators. In January 1891 he was appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary with the dignity of a life peerage as Baron Hannen, of Burdock in the County of Sussex, but in that capacity he had few opportunities for displaying his powers, and he retired at the close of the session of 1893.\n He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1891. He died in London, after a prolonged illness, on 29 March 1894 and is interred in the catacombs of West Norwood Cemetery\n He was the elder brother of Sir Nicholas John Hannen who was Chief Justice of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan from 1891 to 1900 and concurrently British Consul General at Shanghai from 1891 to 1898.  Nicholas Hannen also served as the Judge of the British Court for Japan from 1881 to 1891.",

  "/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_(Court_of_Appeal)": "The Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador is at the top of the hierarchy of courts for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Court of Appeal derives its powers and jurisdiction from the Court of Appeal Act.\n The independent Court of Appeal was established in 2018 and comprises the Chief Justice and 5 other justices. At any given time there may be one or more additional justices who sit as supernumerary justices. From 1975 until 2018 the Court of Appeal was constituted as the appeal division of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador with judges appointed specifically to hear appeals from the Trial Division of the Supreme Court. Prior to 1975 both trial and appeals were carried out in the Supreme Court, where the individual judges routinely acted as a trial judges but, in the event of an appeal, would sit together (en banc) to hear it.\n The Court now hears appeals of all type from the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador's General Division and Family Division, the Provincial Court, and a number of boards and tribunals. Decisions are subject to final appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Prior to 1949, when Newfoundland became a province of Canada, final appeals passed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which was the highest court for the British Empire and Commonwealth.  (For a list of Newfoundland decisions from the Judicial Committee, see:  List of Newfoundland Cases of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (pre-1949)).",

One judge of the English High Court, Lord Justice Mathew, said that Wilson would certainly have been raised to the bench in Britain, had he  not accepted an appointment to the High Court of Calcutta in 1878 (at that time, known as the High Court of Judicature, Fort Williams, Bengal).\n In 1880, Wilson was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta, a position he held until 1884.\n In 1888\u201389, Wilson was president of a Commission of Inquiry which sat  at Poona, to investigate corruption allegations which had been made against Arthur Crawford, the Commissioner of the Central Division of the Bombay Presidency.    The lengthy hearings attracted considerable public attention in both India and Britain.  After sixty-seven public sittings, the Commission found Crawford not guilty of the more serious charges of taking bribes, but guilty of borrowing money from his Indian subordinates.\n In  1892, Wilson resigned his position on the Calcutta High Court and returned to Britain.  He was appointed Legal Adviser and Solicitor to the Indian Office, and in 1898 was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE).\n In March 1902, Wilson was sworn a member of the Privy Council, and the following month took his place on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court for the Empire.

He sat on the Judicial Committee for nine years, retiring in 1911.\n Wilson had a family of two sons and one daughter. Both sons were  in the Army. One of them was drowned while crossing a river in India, and the other was killed campaigning in South Africa.\n Wilson died on 28 December 1915, at the Moorings, Heathside, Woking.",
