Vast plateaus, river valleys, mountains, and castles abound in Tr\u00e1s os Montes e Alto Douro.\n A first attempt to register its constitution was made under the reign of King Sancho II (1223\u20131248). A second was made in the reign of his son and successor, Afonso III (1248\u20131279), under the Inquiri\u00e7\u00f5es or royal commissions in 1258, intending to base the territory of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes on so-called \"new towns\" under direct control of the Crown. Afonso III (1248\u20131279) gave it its charter in 1253, referring to the town, \"a hill opposite the Crespos\", which already had a core of settlements organized around the Church of St. Facundo.\n Currently the region is divided into two districts on the right (northern) bank of the Douro river \u2014 Vila Real and Bragan\u00e7a, with 5 other municipalities on the south bank of the Douro river included in the districts of Viseu and Guarda. The name \u2014 Beyond-the-Mountains and Upper Douro \u2014 refers to the location on the \"other\" (eastern) side of such mountains as Mar\u00e3o, Alv\u00e3o and Ger\u00eas, which separate the coast from the interior, and along the upper valley of the Douro River. This isolation kept the province poor and underpopulated for centuries, causing many people to move to the coast or emigrate to other European countries such as France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, and to Brazil.\n The most important towns in the region are Vila Real, Bragan\u00e7a, Chaves, Mirandela, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Lamego, Peso da R\u00e9gua, Mogadouro, Miranda do Douro and Valpa\u00e7os.  All are relatively small, with less than 50 000 inhabitants. Many people in the region still live in small villages.  Traditionally these villages were cut off from the coast due to the lack of good roads, and suffered the effects of poverty and isolation. Emigration was often the only option. Today the situation has improved with better roads, but most villages are still losing population as youngsters there move to bigger towns for a better life.\n In small villages the ageing inhabitants still eke out a living from small farms.  Corn, rye, potatoes, wheat, olive oil, chestnuts, and grapes for wine (namely Port wine) have been the main agricultural products.  Granite and mineral water are also important industries.\n There is a popular saying: \"Beyond Mar\u00e3o, those who rule are those who're there\" (\"Para l\u00e1 do Mar\u00e3o mandam os que l\u00e1 est\u00e3o\").  Lisbon has paid little attention to this area until recent years.
