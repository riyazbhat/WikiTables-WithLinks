A member of the Democratic Party and a devoted New Dealer, Black endorsed Franklin D. Roosevelt in both the 1932 and 1936 presidential elections. Having gained a reputation in the Senate as a reformer, Black was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Roosevelt and confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 63 to 16 (6 Democratic Senators and 10 Republican Senators voted against him). He was the first of nine Roosevelt nominees to the Court, and he outlasted all except for William O. Douglas.\n The fifth longest-serving justice in Supreme Court history, Black was one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the 20th century. \n He is noted for his advocacy of a textualist reading of the United States Constitution and of the position that the liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights were imposed on the states (\"incorporated\") by the Fourteenth Amendment. During his political career Black was regarded as a staunch supporter of liberal policies and civil liberties.\n However, Black wrote the majority opinion in Korematsu v. United States (1944), during World War II, which upheld the Japanese-American internment that had taken place. Black opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept made it impossible for the government to enact legislation that conservatives claimed interfered with the ostensible freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis in the words of the Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965).\n Before he became a U.S. Senator (D-AL), Black espoused anti-Catholic views and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama, but he resigned in 1925. Years later he said: \"Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have had nothing to do with it since that time. I abandoned it.
