  "/wiki/National_Stadium": "Many countries have a national sport stadium, which typically serves as the primary or exclusive home for one or more of a country's national representative sports teams.  The term is most often used in reference to an association football stadium.  Usually, a national stadium will be in or very near a country's capital city or largest city.  It is generally (but not always) the country's largest and most lavish sports venue with a rich history of hosting a major moment in sports (i.e. FIFA World Cup, Olympics, etc.).  In many, but not all cases, it is also used by a local team.  Many countries, including Spain and the United States, do not have a national stadium designated as such; instead matches are rotated throughout the country.  The lack of a national stadium can be seen as advantageous as designating a single stadium would limit the fan base capable of realistically attending matches as well as the concern of the cost of transportation, especially in the case of the United States due to its geographical size and high population.",
