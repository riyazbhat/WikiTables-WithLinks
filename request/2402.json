  "/wiki/St_Trinian's_(2007_film)": "St Trinian's is a 2007 British comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of British films based on the works of cartoonist Ronald Searle set in St Trinian's School. The first five films form a series,[citation needed] starting with The Belles of St Trinian's in 1954, with sequels in 1957, 1960, 1966 and 1980.

St Trinian's received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years.",
