  "/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.": "Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club (/\u02c8bra\u026at\u0259n\u2009...\u2009\u02c8ho\u028av/), commonly referred to as simply Brighton, is an English professional football club based in the city of Brighton. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of the English football league system. The club's home ground is the 30,750-capacity Falmer Stadium, situated in Falmer to the north east of the city.\n Founded in 1901, and nicknamed the \"Seagulls\" or \"Albion\", Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League, before being elected to the Football League in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the First Division and reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.\n By the late 1990s, Brighton was in the fourth tier of English football and were having financial difficulties. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the Conference in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive promotions in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the 2016\u201317 season, Brighton finished second in the EFL Championship and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.",
  "/wiki/English_Football_League_play-offs": "The English Football League play-offs are an annual series of association football matches to determine the final promotion places within each division of the English Football League (EFL). In each division it involves the four teams that finish directly below the automatic promotion places. These teams meet in a series of play-off matches to determine the final team that will be promoted.\n The play-offs were first introduced in 1987 and have been staged at the conclusion of every season since. Since 1990 the winners of each division's play-off competition have been determined in a one-off final. Blackpool are the most successful club in play-off history, winning five times - 1992, 2001, 2007, 2010, and 2017."
