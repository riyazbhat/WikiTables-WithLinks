He was raised to the baronetage in 1882, the first Victorian to be granted a hereditary honour.\n Clarke was born in Van Diemen's Land, the son of the pastoralist William John Turner Clarke. He arrived in the Port Phillip District (the future Victoria) in 1850, where he managed many of his father's properties and acquired some of his own. Upon his father's death in 1874, he became the largest landowner in the colony. Clarke was made a baronet for his work as the head of the Melbourne International Exhibition, which brought Australia to international attention. He also served terms as president of the Australian Club, president of the Victorian Football Association, and president of the Melbourne Cricket Club, and was prominent in yachting and horse racing circles. Clarke gave generously to charitable organisations, and also made significant financial contributions to the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and the University of Melbourne.

It is named after and based in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, and plays its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\n Melbourne is the world's oldest professional club of any football code. The club's origins can be traced to an 1858 letter in which Tom Wills, captain of the Victoria cricket team, calls for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with its own \"code of laws\". An informal Melbourne team played that winter and was officially formed in May 1859 when Wills and three other members codified \"The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club\"\u2014the basis of Australian rules football. The club was a dominant force in the early years of Australian rules football competition, and was also a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1896, which later became the national Australian Football League. Melbourne has won 12 VFL/AFL premierships, the latest in 1964. Melbourne was a foundation team of the AFL Women's league, entering the competition in the inaugural year 2017.\n The club celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008 by naming \"150 Heroes\" as well as creating a birthday logo which appeared on its official guernsey.\n The football club has been a sporting section of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) since 2009, having previously been associated with the MCC between 1889 and 1980.",

  "/wiki/Alec_Gillon": "Alexander George Gillon AM OBE (23 December 1909 \u2013 25 August 2007) was a civic and sporting administrator in Melbourne, Australia. He was most notable as the longest-serving president of the Victorian Football Association, and as a mayor of the City of Brunswick.\n Gillon was born in Broadmeadows in north-western Melbourne. He played Australian rules football when he was young, and at his peak played 88 games for the Brunswick Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) during the 1930s, where he was part of Brunswick's 1938 premiership team. He was cleared to Coburg in May 1939 and played there for one season.\n After World War II, Gillon took a position on the Brunswick Football Club committee. He served as a club delegate on the VFA Board of Management from 1949 until 1953. Then in February 1954, he successfully challenged Lewis Page for presidency of the VFA. When Gillon took on the presidency, the VFA was in decline and struggling badly compared with the strong position it had enjoyed during the 1940s: crowds were declining due to the abandoning of the popular throw pass rule in 1950, various social and demographic changes in post-war Melbourne were reducing crowds and revenues, and the Association board was suffering from factional fighting as a result of the fall-out from the changes. Gillon soon provided strong leadership, which largely re-unified the Association's board, and the Association began to recover from a situation which threatened its viability.\n One of the first challenges Gillon faced during his presidency was grounds control, as there were several bids by other football codes during the 1950s, and then by Victorian Football League (VFL) clubs during the 1960s, to take over the tenancy of VFA grounds; Gillon refused to compromise on the VFA's requirement that clubs had sole winter use of their grounds, which cost Prahran (temporarily) and Moorabbin (permanently) their places in the Association, but it set a strong example that the VFA was prepared to defend itself against stronger opponents, a trait which Gillon carried throughout his presidency. Gillon then oversaw the introduction of Sunday football in 1960, the early 1960s expansion of the Association into the outer suburbs to overcome post-war demographic shifts in the inner suburbs, and the partitioning of the VFA into two divisions in 1961; and after the VFA secured weekly television coverage from 1967, the VFA enjoyed one of its most successful periods ever during the 1970s. Also under Gillon's presidency, however, the VFA's relationship with the VFL soured, culminating in the VFA's expulsion in 1970 from the Australian National Football Council (of which Gillon had served as vice-president during the late 1960s) and a lingering adversarial relationship between the competitions which lasted until the 1980s. When asked about his relationship with the VFL on television during the 1970s, Gillon replied \"I don't hate the VFL; I'm just pro-VFA.\"\n Gillon went on to become the VFA's longest-serving president, serving unopposed for 27 seasons from 1954 until 1980, and exceeding the 25-year tenure of J. G. Aikman (1903\u20131928). In 1981, with the VFA's success of the 1970s beginning to wane and many clubs believing a new direction was required, Gillon was challenged for the presidency and defeated by Alan Wickes. Five years later, Gillon returned as part of the Football Organisation Review Team (FORT), which was formed in 1986 by Wickes' successor, Brook Andersen, to develop a new strategy for the VFA in a changing Victorian football market; the FORT's controversial report, which sought to rationalise the VFA to 12 teams, was rejected by the clubs but was instrumental in shaping the natural contraction of the VFA in the late 1980s.\n Outside football, Gillon served a long career in local government. In 1954, he was elected to the council of the City of Brunswick. He was a justice of the peace and a one-time vice-chairman of the Board of Works, before serving as the mayor of Brunswick. Gillon's effectiveness as a civic administrator was well regarded, and he was twice appointed by the State Government to serve as the commissioner of a city outside Brunswick. His first appointment occurred in November 1976, when the 12-man Sunshine council was sacked by the state government due to its financial mismanagement, having left the city $1,700,000 in deficit; Gillon served as the state-appointed commissioner of the City of Sunshine until early 1982, successfully restoring its finances to the point that an elected council could be restored to the city. Later in 1982, the Richmond council was dismissed by the state government following a report which revealed allegations of electoral malpractice and fraud, and Gillon was appointed by the state as commissioner of the City of Richmond, serving in that role until 1988.\n For his services to the Brunswick Football Club and the Brunswick Council, the Brunswick Football Ground was renamed the A. G. Gillon Oval in his honour in early 1976. The annual award for the best and fairest player in the VFA Thirds competition (specifically for Division 1 in years when the competition was partitioned) was named the A. G. Gillon Medal in his honour.  He was also appointed OBE in the 1976 New Year Honours and a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 1987 Australia Day Honours.",

He served on the VFA board of management through the 1970s. While at Frankston, Wickes was instrumental in the establishment of the Frankston District Junior Football League.\n In 1981, Wickes challenged and defeated 27-year incumbent Alex Gillon for the presidency of the VFA. Wickes served as president for a difficult four season tenure, at a time when the popularity and profitability of the Association was declining rapidly, in part due to the loss of television coverage and the expansion of the VFL into the Sunday football market. He oversaw restructure of the second division in 1982, the expansion of the Association into the outer suburbs (incorporating clubs including Springvale, Kilsyth and Berwick), and made an unsuccessful attempt to expand the VFA to thirty teams. Wickes stood down as president after the 1984 season, expressing frustration at poor quality of club-level administration in the VFA at the time.\n Wickes has remained active in sports administration and community events in Frankston, and has served as president of the Frankston and District Junior Football League in the late 2000s.",

  "/wiki/Victorian_Football_League": "The Victorian Football League (VFL) is the major state-level Australian rules football league in Victoria. The league evolved from the former Victorian Football Association (VFA), and has been known by its current name since 1996. For historical purposes, the present VFL is sometimes referred to as the VFA/VFL, to distinguish it from the present day Australian Football League, which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League and is sometimes referred to as the VFL/AFL.\n The VFA was formed in 1877 and is the second-oldest Australian rules football league, replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been the hallmark of the early years of the game. Initially serving a primarily administrative function, the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896. The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL. From 1897 until 1995, the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria's secondary senior club competition. Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL, the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules, and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays.\n Since 1995, the league has been administered by AFL Victoria (and its predecessors), and serves as one of the second-tier regional Australian semi-professional competitions which sits underneath the fully professional Australian Football League. From the 2018 season it will comprise 15 teams from throughout Victoria, nine of which have a continuous VFA heritage. Since 2000, the VFL has served partially as a reserves competition for the AFL, with some Victorian-based clubs fielding their reserves teams in the VFL and others affiliated such that their reserves player can play in VFL teams. AFL Victoria also operates a women's football competition under the Victorian Football League brand, known as the VFL Women's, which was established in 2016."
