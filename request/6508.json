  "/wiki/Kiev": "Kiev or Kyiv[a] (Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432, romanized: Kyiv; Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432, romanized: Kiyev) is the capital and most populous city of Ukraine. It is in north-central Ukraine along the Dnieper River. Its population in July 2015 was 2,887,974 (though higher estimated numbers have been cited in the press), making Kiev the 6th-most populous city in Europe.\n Kiev is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kiev Metro.\n The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. During its history, Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kiev was a tributary of the Khazars, until its capture by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus', the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours, first Lithuania, then Poland and Russia.\n The city prospered again during the Russian Empire's Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. In 1918, after the Ukrainian National Republic declared independence from Soviet Russia, Kiev became its capital. From 1921 onwards Kiev was a city of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was proclaimed by the Red Army, and, from 1934, Kiev was its capital. The city was almost completely ruined during World War II but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the Soviet Union's third-largest city.\n Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991, Kiev remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country. During the country's transformation to a market economy and electoral democracy, Kiev has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology, but new sectors of the economy such as services and finance facilitated Kiev's growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of housing and urban infrastructure. Kiev emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine; parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union dominate during elections.",

It is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, to which it is connected by the Isthmus of Perekop, and west of the Russian region of Kuban, from which it is separated by the Strait of Kerch though linked by the Crimean Bridge since 2018. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. Across the Black Sea to its west is Romania and to its south Turkey.\n Crimea (or Tauric Peninsula, as it was called from antiquity until the early modern period) has historically been at the boundary between the classical world and the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe. Its southern fringe was colonised by the Greeks, the Persians, the Romans, the Byzantine Empire, the Crimean Goths, the Genoese and the Ottoman Empire, while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading steppe nomads and empires, such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, Alans, Bulgars, Huns, Khazars, Kipchaks, Mongols and the Golden Horde. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the Crimean Khanate during the 15th to 18th century.\n In 1783, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Empire as the result of the Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774). Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Crimea became an autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the USSR. During World War II, Crimea was downgraded to the Crimean Oblast after its entire indigenous population, the Crimean Tatars, were deported to Central Asia, an act recognized as a genocide. In 1954, it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR from the Russian SFSR.\n With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was reestablished as an independent state in 1991, and most of the peninsula was reorganized as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, while the city of Sevastopol retained its special status within Ukraine. The 1997 Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet partitioned the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet and allowed Russia to continue basing its fleet in Crimea: both the Ukrainian Naval Forces and Russian's Black Sea Fleet were to be headquartered in Sevastopol. Ukraine extended Russia's lease of the naval facilities under the 2010 Kharkiv Pact in exchange for further discounted natural gas.\n In February 2014, following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution that ousted the Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, pro-Russian separatists and Russian Armed Forces took over the territory. A controversial Crimea-wide referendum, unconstitutional under the Ukrainian and Crimean constitutions, was held on the issue of reunification with Russia; its official results showed majority support for reunification, however, the vote was boycotted by many loyal to Ukraine and declared illegitimate by Western governments and the United Nations.

Mosk\u00f3vskiy patriarkh\u00e1t), is one of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian churches. The primate of the ROC is the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'. The ROC, as well as its primate, officially ranks fifth in the Orthodox order of precedence, immediately below the four ancient patriarchates of the Greek Orthodox Church: Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. Since 15 October 2018, the ROC is not in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, having unilaterally severed ties in reaction to the establishment of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was finalised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 5 January 2019.\n The Christianization of Kievan Rus', widely seen as the birth of the ROC, is believed to have occurred in 988 through the baptism of the Kievan prince Vladimir and his people by the clergy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, whose constituent part the ROC remained for the next six centuries, while the Kievan see remained in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate until 1686.\n The ROC currently claims its exclusive jurisdiction over the Orthodox Christians, irrespective of their ethnic background, who reside in the former member republics of the Soviet Union, excluding Georgia and Armenia, although this claim is disputed in such countries as Estonia, Moldova and Ukraine and consequently parallel canonical Orthodox jurisdictions exist in those: the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, the Metropolis of Bessarabia, and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, respectively. It also exercises ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the autonomous Church of Japan and the Orthodox Christians resident in the People's Republic of China. The ROC branches in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Moldova and Ukraine since the 1990s enjoy various degrees of self-government, albeit short of the status of formal ecclesiastical autonomy.\n The ROC should not be confused with the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), another autocephalous Orthodox church (since 1970, but not universally recognised in this status and viewed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a branch of the ROC), that traces its existence in North America to the time of the Russian missionaries in Alaska (then part of the Russian Empire) in the late 18th century. The ROC should also not be confused with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (also known as the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, or ROCOR), headquartered in the United States. The ROCOR was instituted in the 1920s by Russian communities outside then Communist Russia, which refused to recognize the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate then de facto headed by Metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky. The two churches reconciled on May 17, 2007; the ROCOR is now a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church.",

On 22 December 1905, he became a monk at Roman, being ordained a deacon three days later. From January 1907 to July 1908, he studied at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. From 1905 to 1908, he was, as a deacon, attached to the Cathedral of the Holy Voievods, Roman, while in 1908 he was transferred to the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas, Gala\u0163i. There, on 6 December 1908, he was ordained a priest, being elevated to the dignity of Archimandrite on 1 January 1909. Three months later, he was named director of the Gala\u0163i Theological Seminary and Vicar of the Archbishopric of the Lower Danube. On 1 September 1918, he became director of the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Theological Seminary, being named Exarch of Bessarabia's monasteries two months later (soon after that province united with the Kingdom of Romania).\n On 17 March 1921, Puiu was elected Bishop of Arge\u015f. He was consecrated in that position on 25 March by Metropolitan of Wallachia Miron Cristea in the Bucharest Metropolitan Cathedral and invested into the office that day by King Ferdinand. Two days later he was installed in the episcopal chair at Curtea de Arge\u015f Cathedral; he remained there for two years. In 1923 he became bishop of Hotin, where he remained until 1935. During his time in that position, he undertook a number of actions to try to improve the lives of the inhabitants of the B\u0103l\u021bi area, his seat being in that city. On 17 October of that year, he was elected Archbishop of Cern\u0103u\u0163i and Metropolitan of Bukovina, being seated on 10 November. In May 1940, he left that position and retired to a monastery (Puiu later claimed that this was due to a conflict with King Carol II due to the latter's alleged attempts to take Bukovina's riches for himself). While Metropolitan of Bukovina, Puiu had tens of churches changed from wooden construction to concrete, repaired a few hundred others, established eateries for foresters, and gave free wood to peasants (which helped rebuild the ski resort of Vatra Dornei).\nRomania entered World War II in 1941, and Puiu served as Metropolitan of occupied Transnistria at Odessa from 16 November 1942 to 14 December 1943. There, he reopened churches closed by the Soviet authorities, helped the needy, the poor and children, and educated people in the Orthodox faith. He disregarded the ongoing extermination of the Jews in the region by the Romanian authorities.[citation needed] In August 1944, he was in Zagreb (present-day Croatia) for the ordination of an Orthodox bishop there, accompanied by a handful of Romanian priests. He sent the priests back to Romania, sure they would be safe, but decided to flee to the west, fearing punishment from the Soviets for his wartime religious activity in Transnistria. Indeed, a People's Tribunal, the Romanian counterpart of the Nuremberg military tribunals, sentenced him to death in absentia for war crimes on 21 February 1946.\n For several years Puiu wandered around Europe, living for short periods in Vienna, Germany, Switzerland, Venice, Draguignan and Auvergne, before settling for good in Viels-Maisons, a village on the Marne River 96 km east of Paris. At one point during these travels, self-proclaimed Iron Guard leader Horia Sima offered Puiu the post of Minister of Religious Affairs in his government in exile, but the latter declined.\n From 1948 to 1958 Puiu headed the Romanian Orthodox Church in France. Still a bishop, his church was subordinated to the ROCOR Metropolitan in New York City, and he used the Romanian Orthodox parish in Paris (established in the 19th century) as his cathedral. On 28 February 1950, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Bucharest, headed by Patriarch Justinian Marina and under pressure from the Communist authorities, deposed Puiu from his ecclesiastical position; he was rehabilitated on 25 September 1990. Among the reasons cited for this action was an allegedly pro-Catholic 1925 article he had written; for this, he was branded an \"imperialist agent\".\n As of 1 April 1958, Puiu disbanded the Paris Archdiocese he had established a decade earlier. There were three main reasons for this action. First, its goal of uniting all Romanian Orthodox believers in Western Europe completely failed, as it never had more than one parish. Second, the church faced a constant clergy and financial shortfall. Third, its subordination to ROCOR isolated it within the wider Orthodox world. On top of all this, the church was riven by the political factionalism that marked the Romanian exile community. Thus, the church was returned to the priests who had led it before Puiu's arrival, and the bishop retired to Viels-Maisons, where he died six years later. He was buried in that village but later moved to Montparnasse Cemetery, where he lies today.",

He studied at the Kiev-Mogila Academy and then at the Moscow Theological Academy, where he later taught rhetoric (1718). After serving as a chaplain in the Russian navy he became archimandrite of the Tver Monastery and a member of the Holy Synod in 1723.\n In 1725 he was consecrated bishop of Pskov. He was elevated to the office of archbishop of Kiev by the tsar in 1731, and he later convinced the church authorities to restore Kiev eparchy as a Kiev metropoly, whereupon he took the title \u2018Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and Little Russia\u2019 in 1743.\n A supporter of Archbishop Teofan Prokopovych, Zaborovsky carried out the Russian government's policy of destroying the autonomy of the Ukrainian church by instituting the \"Dukhovnyi reglament\" of 1721 and other synodal ukases. He did, however, raise the academic standards and improve the economic standing of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. He published a new statute for the academy, reformed the curriculum (adding new courses in more modern disciplines), and provided much money for the expansion of the academy's buildings and for scholarships for poor students. The academy even briefly became known as the Mohyla-Zaborovsky Academy. The Great Bell Tower of the Kievan Cave Monastery (1736\u201345), the bell tower of the Saint Sophia Cathedral, the baroque Zaborovsky Gate, and a number of other buildings were constructed during his tenure as metropolitan.

In 1686, Joachim appointed him metropolitan of Kazan and Sviyazhsk. On 24 August 1690, Adrian was chosen to replace Joachim on his post. Patriarch Adrian was a staunch adherent of traditional norms and opposed Peter the Great's reforms (e.g., he criticized Peter's decree on mandatory shaving of beards). Adrian's relations with the tsar were tense; however, he had to accept some of Peter's criticism about deficiencies in management of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n Adrian sought to eradicate Latinizations in the Church in Ukraine. He introduced a confession requiring bishops-elect to state that the epiclesis, rather than the Words of Institution, transforms the gifts at the liturgy into the body and blood of Christ.",
