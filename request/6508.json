  "/wiki/Romanian_Orthodox_Church": "The Romanian Orthodox Church (Romanian: Biserica Ortodox\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103) is an autocephalous Orthodox Church in full communion with other Eastern Orthodox Christian Churches, one of the nine Patriarchates in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since 1925, the Church's Primate bears the title of Patriarch. Its jurisdiction covers the territories of Romania and Moldova, with additional dioceses for Romanians living in nearby Serbia and Hungary, as well as for diaspora communities in Central and Western Europe, North America and Oceania.\n Currently it is the only autocephalous Church within Eastern Orthodoxy to have a Romance language for liturgical use. The majority of Romania's population (16,367,267, or 85.9% of those for whom data were available, according to the 2011 census data), as well as some 720,000 Moldovans, belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church.\n Members of the Romanian Orthodox Church sometimes refer to Orthodox Christian doctrine as Dreapta credin\u021b\u0103 (right/correct belief or true faith; compare to Greek \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u1f74 \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1, straight/correct belief).",

Zaborovsky, an Orthodox bishop, was born in Zboriv, Ruthenian Voivodeship. He studied at the Kiev-Mogila Academy and then at the Moscow Theological Academy, where he later taught rhetoric (1718). After serving as a chaplain in the Russian navy he became archimandrite of the Tver Monastery and a member of the Holy Synod in 1723. In 1725 he was consecrated bishop of Pskov. He was elevated to the office of archbishop of Kiev by the tsar in 1731, and he later convinced the church authorities to restore Kiev eparchy as a Kiev metropoly, whereupon he took the title \u2018Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and Little Russia\u2019 in 1743. A supporter of Archbishop Teofan Prokopovych, Zaborovsky carried out the Russian government's policy of destroying the autonomy of the Ukrainian church by instituting the Dukhovnyi reglament of 1721 and other synodal ukases. He did, however, raise the academic standards and improve the economic standing of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.",

In 1686, Joachim appointed him metropolitan of Kazan and Sviyazhsk. On 24 August 1690, Adrian was chosen to replace Joachim on his post. Patriarch Adrian was a staunch adherent of traditional norms and opposed Peter the Great's reforms (e.g., he criticized Peter's decree on mandatory shaving of beards). Adrian's relations with the tsar were tense; however, he had to accept some of Peter's criticism about deficiencies in management of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n Adrian sought to eradicate Latinizations in the Church in Ukraine. He introduced a confession requiring bishops-elect to state that the epiclesis, rather than the Words of Institution, transforms the gifts at the liturgy into the body and blood of Christ.",
