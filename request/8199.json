Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets; since 2012, around 20% of each incoming class does not graduate. Tuition along with room and board are all paid for by the Air Force.  Cadets receive a monthly stipend, but incur a commitment to serve a number of years of military service after graduation.\n The program at the academy is guided by the Air Force's core values of \"Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do\", and based on four \"pillars of excellence\": military training, academics, athletics and character development. In addition to a rigorous military training regimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies and physical education. All cadets participate in either intercollegiate or intramural athletics, and a thorough character development and leadership curriculum provides cadets a basis for future officership.

The WWPA is affiliated with the NCAA, and includes 15 member institutions, mostly in California, with one institution each in Colorado, Illinois, and West Virginia and two in Erie, Pennsylvania. The league has eight teams in its men's league and nine in its women's league, with only Fresno Pacific and UC San Diego fielding teams for both sexes in the WWPA. The three easternmost schools, Gannon, Mercyhurst, and Salem, also field teams for both men and women, but only the women's teams are in the WWPA, with the men's teams instead playing in the Collegiate Water Polo Association.\n The WWPA members play a regular season of conference and non-conference games, followed by a championship tournament at the conclusion of both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s seasons, with the winner earning the league\u2019s automatic bid to the NCAAs."
