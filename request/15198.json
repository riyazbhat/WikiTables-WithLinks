  "/wiki/Betting_(poker)": "In the game of poker, the play largely centers on the act of betting, and as such, a protocol has been developed to speed up play, lessen confusion, and increase security while playing.

  "/wiki/Hold'em": "Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards (the flop), later an additional single card (the turn or fourth street), and a final card (the river or fifth street). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. The player who has the best hand and has not folded by the end of all betting rounds wins all of the money bet for the hand, known as the pot. Texas hold 'em is the H game featured in HORSE and in HOSE.",
  "/wiki/David_Lukaszewski": "David Lukaszewski (born 1970) is an American poker player. He was a Poker Room Shift Manager at the Desert Diamond Casino who won a bracelet in the 2003 Casino Employees Championship event at the World Series of Poker. The Casino Employees Championship event was the first time that Lukaszewski had played in a tournament with a buy-in greater than $50. At the start of 2003, Lukaszewski set the modest goal of competing in a major poker tournament and at the last minute, he and several friends decided to drive to Las Vegas to play in the WSOP. Lukaszewski won the entry to the event by winning a $65 single-table satellite at Binion's Horseshoe. When the tournament reached the final three players, they started shooting Kamikaze's.

  "/wiki/Seven-card_stud": "Seven-card stud, also known as Seven-Toed Pete or Down-The-River is a variant of stud poker. Until the recent increase in popularity of Texas hold 'em, seven-card stud was the most widely played poker variant in home games across the United States, and in casinos in the eastern part of the country. Two to eight players is common, though eight may require special rules for the last cards dealt if no players fold. With experienced players who fold often, even playing with nine players is possible. In casino play, it is common to use a small ante and bring-in. In home games, it is typical to use an ante only. Seven-card stud is the S game in HORSE and similar mixed game formats.",

  "/wiki/Draw_(poker)": "A poker player is drawing if they have a hand that is incomplete and needs further cards to become valuable. The hand itself is called a draw or drawing hand. For example, in seven-card stud, if four of a player's first five cards are all spades, but the hand is otherwise weak, they are drawing to a flush. In contrast, a made hand already has value and does not necessarily need to draw to win. A made starting hand with no help can lose to an inferior starting hand with a favorable draw. If an opponent has a made hand that will beat the player's draw, then the player is drawing dead; even if they make their desired hand, they will lose. Not only draws benefit from additional cards; many made hands can be improved by catching an out - and may have to in order to win.",

It is one of the oldest forms of poker, and has been played since the very start of the 20th Century. It emerged around the time people started using the 52-card deck instead of 20 for poker. The object of Razz is to make the lowest possible five-card hand from the seven cards you are dealt. In Razz, straights and flushes do not count against the player for low, and the ace always plays low. Thus, the best possible Razz hand is 5-4-3-2-A, or 5 high, also known as the wheel or the bicycle. Deuce-to-seven Razz is also sometimes played. Razz is featured in the mixed game rotation H.O.R.S.E. as the R in the game's name.",
