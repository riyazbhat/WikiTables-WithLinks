First released on May 23, 2002, for the arcades, in Japan, it was later ported to the PlayStation 2, and published in North America in 2003. The game received updated versions for several platforms: Guilty Gear X2 #Reload (2003), Guilty Gear XX Slash (2005), Guilty Gear XX Accent Core (2006), Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), and Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R (2012). Each update served to the company to perform adjustments comparing to the previous versions and was published in different platforms and regions.\n Although each installment has received both praise and criticism for its particularities, all the Guilty Gear X2 updated versions have generally been well received by critics. Graphics, online option and its price were the aspects most praised for the first update, while Accent Core divided opinions about its innovations and was panned by its Wii controls. Core Plus was the source of much praise, although it was not totally satisfying for reviewers; Plus R, however, is the one that has the lowest average scores from GameRankings and Metacritic. Sales-wise, there is a decline from #Reload to Core Plus.",
