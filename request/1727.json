It weighs about 1\u00a0kg.

Endangered (EN), as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after Critically Endangered\u00a0(CR). In 2012, the IUCN Red List featured 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered\u00a0(EN) worldwide. The figures for 1998 were 1,102 and 1,197 respectively.

The scientist who discovered the species named it after Cleese, star of Monty Python, mainly because of Cleese's fondness for lemurs, as shown in Operation Lemur With John Cleese and Fierce Creatures, and his efforts at protecting and preserving them. The species was first discovered in 1990 by a team of scientists from Zurich University led by Urs Thalmann, but wasn't formally described as a species until November 11, 2005.",
  "/wiki/Eastern_woolly_lemur": "The eastern woolly lemur (Avahi laniger), also known as the eastern avahi or Gmelin's woolly lemur, is a species of woolly lemur native to eastern Madagascar, where it lives in the wet tropical rainforest at low elevations along the eastern coast of the island or they can also inhabit the northern tip of the island with other species. The woolly lemur name refers to their thick, tightly-curled hair, whereas their generic name avahi refers to their high-pitched defensive call. The eastern woolly lemur almost has an owl-look with its large eyes, small rounded head, and ears that are mostly hidden. This nocturnal animal weighs 1.0\u20131.3\u00a0kg and reaches a length of 27\u201329\u00a0cm with a tail of 33\u201337\u00a0cm.

Like all sifakas, it is a vertical clinger and leaper, and its diet includes mostly seeds and leaves.  The golden-crowned sifaka is named after its discoverer, Ian Tattersall, who first spotted the species in 1974.  However, it was not formally described until 1988, after a research team led by Elwyn L. Simons observed and captured some specimens for captive breeding.  The golden-crowned sifaka most closely resembles the western forest sifakas of the P. verreauxi group, yet its karyotype suggests a closer relationship with the P. diadema group of eastern forest sifakas.  Despite the similarities with both groups, more recent studies of its karyotype support its classification as a distinct species.",

Its fur is thick and silky and generally white with brown on the sides, top of the head, and on the arms. Like all sifakas, it has a long tail that it uses as a balance when leaping from tree to tree. However, its body is so highly adapted to an arboreal existence, on the ground its only means of locomotion is hopping. The species lives in small troops which forage for food.",
