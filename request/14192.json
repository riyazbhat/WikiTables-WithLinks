The club currently plays in the Premier League, the first tier of English football. Nicknamed \"the Clarets\", due to the dominant colour of the home shirts, Burnley was one of the twelve founding members of the Football League in 1888. The club's emblem is based on the town's crest, with a Latin motto Pretiumque et Causa Laboris (\"The Prize and the Cause of [Our] Labour\").\n Burnley has been champions of England twice, in 1920\u201321 and 1959\u201360, has won the FA Cup once, in 1914, and has won the Community Shield twice, in 1960 and 1973. The Clarets also reached the 1961 quarter-finals of the European Cup. Burnley is one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End, Sheffield United and Portsmouth.\n In the 1920\u201321 campaign, Burnley was crowned champions of England for the first time when they won the First Division.[nb 1] During that season the team embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, which remained an English record until it was beaten by Arsenal in 2003\u201304. Burnley attained a second league championship in 1959\u201360 with a team consisting of mostly youth academy graduates, winning the title with a last-day victory over Manchester City, after foundations were laid by pioneers Alan Brown, Bob Lord and Harry Potts. Twenty years later, in 1979\u201380, Burnley was relegated to the Third Division \u2014 the first time in the club's history. Five years later, the team competed in the Fourth Division for the first time following another relegation, and on 9 May 1987 only a 2\u20131 home win against Orient saved Burnley from relegation to the Football Conference and a possible dissolution. Burnley won promotion in 1991\u201392 to the third tier and again in 1999\u20132000 to the second tier, before being promoted to the Premier League in 2008\u201309, 2013\u201314 and 2015\u201316.\n Burnley has played home games at Turf Moor since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from the original premises at Calder Vale.

Often credited with popularising the football philosophy known as Gegenpressing, Klopp is regarded by many as one of the best managers in the world.\n Klopp spent the majority of his playing career at Mainz 05. A hard-working and physical player, he was initially deployed as a striker, before being converted to a defender. Upon retiring in 2001, Klopp became the club's manager, and secured promotion to the Bundesliga in 2004. After suffering relegation in the 2006\u201307 season and being unable to achieve promotion, Klopp resigned at Mainz in 2008, departing as the club's longest-serving manager. Klopp then became manager of Borussia Dortmund, guiding them to the Bundesliga title in 2010\u201311, before winning Dortmund's first-ever domestic double as they enjoyed a record-breaking season.[note 1] Klopp also guided Dortmund to a runner-up finish in the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League.

He guided the club to successive UEFA Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, winning the latter to secure his first\u2014and Liverpool's sixth\u2014title in the competition. Klopp's side also finished second in the 2018\u201319 Premier League, registering 97 points; the third-highest total in the history of the English top division, and the most by a team without winning the title. In the following season, Klopp won the UEFA Super Cup and Liverpool's first FIFA Club World Cup, while his team set the record for the longest unbeaten league run in the club's history, and the second longest unbeaten run in top flight history (both ongoing).[note 2]\n Klopp is a notable proponent of Gegenpressing, whereby the team, after losing possession, immediately attempts to win back possession, rather than falling back to regroup. His sides have been described as playing 'heavy metal' football by pundits and fellow managers, in reference to their pressing and high attacking output. Klopp has cited his main influences as Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi, and Wolfgang Frank, his former coach during his time as a player for Mainz. The importance of emotion is something Klopp has underlined throughout his managerial career, and he has gained notoriety for his enthusiastic touchline celebrations.",
