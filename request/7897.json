  "/wiki/The_Story_of_Woo_Viet": "The Story of Woo Viet is a 1981 Hong Kong political drama directed by Ann Hui and starring Chow Yun-fat as the title character, Woo Viet. The assistant director was Stanley Kwan and the action choreographer was Ching Siu-tung.\n The film was one of the first political dramas made in Hong Kong. It used the story of Vietnamese refugees (boat people) to reflect on Hong Kong's handling of the refugee issue, and also on Hong Kong's sentiment regarding their uncertain future of sovereignty at the time. It is also the second part of Ann Hui's Vietnamese trilogy.\n The movie features a famous Cantonese song, \"This is Love\", sung by Teddy Robin, the producer of this movie.\n In the United States, the film is marketed under the title God of Killers, capitalizing on Chow's popularity in heroic bloodshed films.\n Woo Viet, as he is Vietnamese, should actually have the surname of H\u1ed3 (as in the \"Ho\" in Ho Chi Minh) rather than the Cantonese translation of the Hu / Woo / Ho surname.[citation needed]",
