  "/wiki/S\u014dke": "S\u014dke (\u5b97\u5bb6), pronounced [so\u02d0ke], is a Japanese term that means \"the head family [house].\" In the realm of Japanese traditional arts, it is used synonymously with the term iemoto. Thus, it is often used to indicate \"headmaster\" (or sometimes translated as \"head of the family\" or even \"grand master\".)

It can mean one who is the leader of any school or the master of a style, but it is most commonly used as a highest level Japanese title, referring to the singular leader of a school or style of martial art. The term, however, is not limited to the genre of martial arts.",

After conquering the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands, Kublai Khan's fleet moved on to Japan proper and landed at Hakata Bay, a short distance from Ky\u016bsh\u016b's administrative capital of Dazaifu. Despite the superior weapons and tactics of the Mongols, who established the Yuan Dynasty in China in the early 1270s, the Yuan forces that disembarked at Hakata Bay were grossly outnumbered by the samurai force; the Japanese had been preparing, mobilizing warriors and reinforcing defenses since they heard of the defeats at Tsushima and Iki. The Japanese defenders were aided by major storms which sunk a sizable portion of the Mongolian fleets. Ultimately, the invasion attempt was decisively repulsed shortly after the initial landings.",
