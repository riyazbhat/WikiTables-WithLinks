  "/wiki/S\u014dke": "S\u014dke (\u5b97\u5bb6), pronounced [so\u02d0ke], is a Japanese term that means \"the head family [house].\" In the realm of Japanese traditional arts, it is used synonymously with the term iemoto. Thus, it is often used to indicate \"headmaster\" (or sometimes translated as \"head of the family\" or even \"grand master\".) The English translation of s\u014dke as \"grand master\" is not a literal translation but it does see use by some Japanese sources. It can mean one who is the leader of any school or the master of a style, but it is most commonly used as a highest level Japanese title, referring to the singular leader of a school or style of martial art. The term, however, is not limited to the genre of martial arts. \n S\u014dke is sometimes mistakenly believed to mean \"founder of a style\" because many modern s\u014dke are the first generation headmasters of their art (shodai s\u014dke), and are thus both s\u014dke and founder. However, the successors to the shodai s\u014dke are also s\u014dke themselves. S\u014dke are generally considered the ultimate authority within their art, and have final discretion and authority regarding promotions, curriculum, doctrine, and disciplinary actions. A s\u014dke has the authority to issue a menkyo kaiden certificate indicating that someone has mastered all aspects of his style.\n In some schools such as Kashima-Shinryu there is a related position called Shihanke (\u5e2b\u7bc4\u5bb6 hiragana: \u3057\u306f\u3093\u3051) meaning \"Instructor Line\" that fills a very similar role.  A Shihanke is essentially a second training lineage that exists autonomously from the S\u014dke. In arts where there is a Shihanke and a S\u014dke it is possible for the position of S\u014dke to essentially be a hereditary honorary title in the Iemoto system while the Shihanke is responsible for the actual teaching and operation of the school.\n The widespread use of the term \"s\u014dke\" is controversial in the martial arts community. Traditionally it was used very rarely in Japan, typically only for very old martial arts, although it has become a somewhat common term for headmasters of schools created in the last few decades that attempt to reconstruct or emulate older styles of martial arts. Some modern western s\u014dke have used the title S\u014dke-dai (\u5b97\u5bb6\u4ee3) as a title for their assistant as the leader of their school. The Japanese character dai used in this context translates as \"in place of.\" Thus, a shihan-dai, s\u014dke-dai, or s\u014dke-dairi means \"someone who teaches in temporary place of\" the main instructor, for reasons such as the incapacity of the s\u014dke due to injuries or illnesses.",
  "/wiki/Tsushima_Domain": "Tsushima Fuch\u016b domain (\u5bfe\u99ac\u5e9c\u4e2d\u85e9, Tsushima Fuch\u016b han), also called the Tsushima domain, was a Japanese domain of Japan in the Edo period.  It is associated with Tsushima Province on Tsushima Island in modern-day Nagasaki Prefecture.\n In the han system, Tsushima was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.  In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area. This was different from the feudalism of the West.",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_K\u014dan": "The Battle of K\u014dan (\u5f18\u5b89\u306e\u5f79, K\u014dan no eki), also known as the Second Battle of Hakata Bay, was the second attempt by the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty to invade Japan after their failed attempt seven years earlier at the Battle of Bun'ei. In the summer of 1281 the Yuan invaded with two large armies. The Japanese defenders were aided by a major storm which sunk a sizeable portion of the Mongolian fleets. The invaders who reached the shore were repulsed shortly after landing. The Japanese called the opportune storm kamikaze (\"divine wind\"), a name later used in the Second World War for pilots who carried out aerial suicide attacks.",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Bun'ei": "The Battle of Bun'ei (\u6587\u6c38\u306e\u5f79, Bun'ei no eki), or Bun'ei Campaign, also known as the First Battle of Hakata Bay, was the first attempt by the Yuan Dynasty founded by the Mongols to invade Japan. After conquering the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands, Kublai Khan's fleet moved on to Japan proper and landed at Hakata Bay, a short distance from Ky\u016bsh\u016b's administrative capital of Dazaifu. Despite the superior weapons and tactics of the Mongols, who established the Yuan Dynasty in China in the early 1270s, the Yuan forces that disembarked at Hakata Bay were grossly outnumbered by the samurai force; the Japanese had been preparing, mobilizing warriors and reinforcing defenses since they heard of the defeats at Tsushima and Iki. The Japanese defenders were aided by major storms which sunk a sizable portion of the Mongolian fleets. Ultimately, the invasion attempt was decisively repulsed shortly after the initial landings.\n The Yuan troops withdrew and took refuge on their ships after only one day of fighting.  A typhoon that night, said to be divinely conjured wind, threatened their ships, persuading them to return to Korea. Many of the returning ships sank that night due to the storm.",

It occupies the two main islands of Nakad\u014dri and Wakamatsu, which are connected by Wakamatsu Oohashi (\"Wakamatsu Great Bridge\") via the small, unpopulated islet of Kaminakajima (\u4e0a\u4e2d\u5cf6), as well as several smaller islands, including the populated islands of Arifuku, Hinoshima, Ry\u014dzegaura, Kashiragashima, and Kirinoko. Wakamatsu Island is connected at its northwestern extremity to Ry\u014dzegaura Island by the Ry\u014dzegaura Bridge, and Ry\u014dzegaura Island is further linked with the islands of Arifuku and Hinoshima by breakwaters that allow traffic of automobiles. Kashiragashima Oohashi connects the eastern end of the main island of Nakad\u014dri with Kashiragashima, on which the famous Kashiragashima Church and the defunct Kamigot\u014d Airport are located.\n The islands that comprise the territory of Shin-Kamigot\u014d Town also form the northeastern half of the Got\u014d Islands archipelago, which is the origin of the name Kamigot\u014d (literally, \"Upper Five Islands\"), in which Got\u014d (\"Five Islands\") is the name of the entire archipelago, and Kami- (\"Upper\") refers to the fact that this half of the archipelago is located closer to the Japanese capital relative to the southwestern half. The prefix Shin- (\u65b0) at the beginning of the town's name means \"new,\" so its full name may be translated literally to English as \"New Upper Five Islands Town,\" though the name may be interpreted to refer to the town as a new and expanded version of the former Kamigot\u014d Town, which was centered on the port of Aokata on the western side of the middle of Nakad\u014dri Island.\n As of March 31, 2017, the town has an estimated population of 19,866 and a density of 93 persons per km2.
