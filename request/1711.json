He was the sole Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence. He is one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Carroll was known contemporaneously as the \"First Citizen\" of the American Colonies, a consequence of his editorials in the Maryland Gazette[citation needed]. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and Confederation Congress. Although he was not involved in framing the United States Constitution, it is believed that Freedom of Religion in the Constitution's First Amendment was included to show gratitude to Carroll because Carroll gave financial support from his personal funds for the American Revolutionary War. Carroll later served as the first United States Senator for Maryland. Carroll was the wealthiest and possessed the highest formal education of all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.",
