A total of seven nuclear tests were performed, with approximate yields ranging from 1 to 27 kilotonnes of TNT (4 to 100\u00a0TJ). Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site: Operation Buffalo in 1956 and Operation Antler the following year. Operation Buffalo consisted of four tests; One Tree (12.9 kilotonnes of TNT (54\u00a0TJ)) and Breakaway (10.8 kilotonnes of TNT (45\u00a0TJ)) were detonated on towers, Marcoo  (1.4 kilotonnes of TNT (5.9\u00a0TJ)) at ground level, and the Kite (2.9 kilotonnes of TNT (12\u00a0TJ)) was released by a Royal Air Force (RAF) Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of 11,000 metres (35,000\u00a0ft). This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft.",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_testing": "Nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability of nuclear weapons. Testing nuclear weapons offers practical information about how the weapons function, as well as how detonations are affected by different conditions; and how personnel,  structures, and equipment are affected when subjected to nuclear explosions. However, nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test.",

Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such  as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan, dating to 3,000 BC.",

It is primitive, relict, and non-gliding, and, as the only species in the petaurid genus Gymnobelideus, represents an ancestral form. Formerly, Leadbeater's possums were moderately common within the very small areas they inhabited; their requirement for year-round food supplies and tree-holes to take refuge in during the day restricts them to mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with a dense mid-story of Acacia. The species was named  in 1867 after John Leadbeater, the then taxidermist at the Museum Victoria. They also go by the common name of fairy possum.
