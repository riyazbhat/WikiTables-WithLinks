  "/wiki/Gaisano_Capital": "Gaisano Capital is a chain of malls and supermarkets owned by Edmund S. Gaisano Sr., the second son of Henry S. Gaisano Sr. In the 1970s, he had his own construction business independent of his relatives. One of his projects was to construct a building (which was to be named the Henry Gaisano Building after his father, one of Do\u00f1a Modesta's sons) located along Leon Kilat and Colon streets in Cebu City which was to be leased as a supermarket by his relatives. When the supermarket venture failed, Edmund Gaisano Sr. decided to open his own supermarket. This supermarket became the first Gaisano Capital supermarket and is presently known as Gaisano Capital South.\n As of the last quarter of 2015, Gaisano Capital has 31 stores, with the recent shopping mall opened December 2011 located in Surigao City.
