  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is a type of steam-powered vessel, typically ocean-faring and seaworthy, that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move  (turn) propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s; however, there were exceptions that came before. Steamships usually use the prefix designations of \"PS\" for paddle steamer or \"SS\" for screw steamer (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, \"SS\" is assumed by many to stand for \"steamship\". Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as \"MV\" for motor vessel, so it is not correct to use \"SS\" for most modern vessels.",

They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind. Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail, while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail.",
