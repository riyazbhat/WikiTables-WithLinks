  "/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York": "Buffalo is the second largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the largest city in Western New York. As of 2018[update], the population was 256,304. The city is the county seat of Erie County and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the Canada\u2013United States border, forming part of the bi-national Buffalo Niagara Region. As of the April 1, 2010, the\u00a0metropolitan statistical area\u00a0(MSA) had a population of 1,135,509; the\u00a0combined statistical area\u00a0(CSA), which adds\u00a0Cattaraugus County, had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants.\n The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers. The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration, the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation, and its close proximity to Lake Erie. This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries that dominated the city's economy in the 20th century. Since the city's economy relied heavily on manufacturing, deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population. While some manufacturing activity remains, Buffalo's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare, research and higher education, which emerged following the Great Recession.\n Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie, at the head of the Niagara River, 16 miles (26\u00a0km) south of Niagara Falls. Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname \"The City of Light\". The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by Joseph Ellicott, an extensive system of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, as well as significant architectural works. Its culture blends Northeastern and Midwestern traditions, with annual festivals including Taste of Buffalo and Allentown Art Festival, two professional sports teams (Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres), and a thriving and progressive music and arts scene.",
  "/wiki/Pan-American_Exposition": "The Pan-American Exposition was a World's Fair held in Buffalo, New York, United States, from May 1 through November 2, 1901. The fair occupied 350 acres (0.55\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land on the western edge of what is now Delaware Park, extending from Delaware Avenue to Elmwood Avenue and northward to Great Arrow Avenue. It is remembered today primarily for being the location of the assassination of United States President William McKinley at the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. The exposition was illuminated at night. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. filmed it during the day and a pan of it at night.",
  "/wiki/Electric_Tower": "Electric Tower (or General Electric Tower) is a historic office building and skyscraper located at the corner of Washington and Genesee Streets in Buffalo. It is the seventh tallest building in Buffalo. It stands 294 feet (89.6\u00a0m) and 14 stories tall and is in the Beaux-Arts Classical Revival style. It was designed by James A. Johnson and built in 1912. The tower was based upon an earlier Electric Tower constructed for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition; as with most of the buildings constructed for that event, the original was only temporary and demolished shortly after the fair ended. Additions were made in 1923 and 1928. The white terra-cotta clad was originally built as the Niagara Mohawk Building and features an octagonal tower which steps back three times to terminate in a large lantern. It is also known as Iskalo Electric Tower, for the real estate development company that owns the building.\n The decorative symbols featuring aspects of electricity production are considered precursors to subsequent art deco design.\n Like One M & T Plaza, the spire of the tower is illuminated with different holiday colors at night throughout the year. Both buildings are illuminated blue and gold for the Buffalo Sabres during the National Hockey League playoffs.\n The Electric Tower hosts the annual Buffalo Ball Drop on New Year's Eve, one of the continent's largest ball drops outside the New York City ball drop. People from all around gather in Roosevelt Plaza to ring in and celebrate the New Year. The Buffalo Ball Drop is accompanied by live performances and a spectacular firework show.\n It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 2008.",

With a population of 208,046, Rochester is the third most populous city in New York state, after New York City and Buffalo. The metropolitan area has a population of just over one million people. It is about 73 miles (117\u00a0km) east of Buffalo and 87 miles (140\u00a0km) west of Syracuse.\n Rochester was one of the United States' first boom towns, initially due to the fertile Genesee River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing hub. Several of the region's universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology) have renowned research programs.[citation needed]  The area is the birthplace of Kodak, Paychex, Western Union, French's, Bausch & Lomb, Gleason, Rag\u00fa and Xerox, which conduct extensive research and manufacturing of industrial and consumer products. Until 2010, the Rochester metropolitan area was the second-largest regional economy in New York State, after the New York City metropolitan area. Rochester's GMP has since ranked just below Buffalo's, while exceeding it in per-capita income.\n In 2007, the 25th edition of the Places Rated Almanac rated Rochester the \"most livable city\" among 379 U.S. metropolitan areas. In 2010 Forbes rated Rochester the third-best place to raise a family in the United States. In 2012 Kiplinger rated Rochester the fifth-best city in the United States for families, citing low cost of living, top public schools, and a low unemployment rate.\n Rochester is a global city with sufficiency status.[citation needed]",

An extensive renovation of the building began in 2002. This modernization, which cost at least $103 million, is now finished.\n Prior to reconstruction, the building was home to the state Comptroller's Office.  With the renovation complete, the new tenants include the New York State Department of Civil Service, Department of State, New York State Banking Department, New York State Liquor Authority, and Division of the Budget.\n The Alfred E. Smith Building has several distinctive features. These include the engraving of the names of all 62 New York State counties around the street-level facade and an Art Deco lobby with a mural depicting famous New Yorkers.

  "/wiki/Albany,_New_York": "Albany (/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0lb\u0259ni/ (listen) AWL-b\u0259-nee) is the capital of the U.S. state of New York and the seat and largest city of Albany County. Albany is located on the west bank of the Hudson River approximately 10 miles (16\u00a0km) south of its confluence with the Mohawk River and approximately 135 miles (220\u00a0km) north of New York City.\n Albany is known for its rich history, commerce, culture, architecture, and institutions of higher education. Albany constitutes the economic and cultural core of the Capital District of New York State, which comprises the Albany\u2013Schenectady\u2013Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, including the nearby cities and suburbs of Troy, Schenectady, and Saratoga Springs. With a 2013 Census-estimated population of 1.1 million the Capital District is the third-most populous metropolitan region in the state. As of the 2010 census, the population of Albany was 97,856.\n The area that later became Albany was settled by Dutch colonists who, in 1614, built Fort Nassau for fur trading and, in 1624, built Fort Orange. In 1664, the English took over the Dutch settlements, renaming the city as Albany, in honor of the then Duke of Albany, the future James II of England and James VII of Scotland. The city was officially chartered in 1686 under English rule. It became the capital of New York in 1797 following formation of the United States. Albany is one of the oldest surviving settlements of the original British thirteen colonies, and is the longest continuously chartered city in the United States.\n During the late 18th century and throughout most of the 19th, Albany was a center of trade and transportation. The city lies toward the north end of the navigable Hudson River, was the original eastern terminus of the Erie Canal connecting to the Great Lakes, and was home to some of the earliest railroad systems in the world. In the 1920s, a powerful political machine controlled by the Democratic Party arose in Albany. In the latter part of the 20th century, Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and suburbanization; however, the New York State Legislature approved a $234 million building and renovation plan for the City in the 1990s that spurred renovation and building projects around the downtown area.  In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.",
