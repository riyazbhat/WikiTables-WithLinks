The reservation was opened to homesteaders in 1905 and the county was created in 1913.  Due to dangerous roads, mountainous terrain, and bad weather preventing travel via a direct route, 19th century residents in present-day Daggett County had to travel 400 to 800 miles (640 to 1,290\u00a0km) on both stage and rail to conduct business in Vernal, the county seat for Uintah County a mere 50 miles (80\u00a0km) away.
