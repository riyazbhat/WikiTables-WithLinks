  "/wiki/List_of_counties_of_New_Brunswick": "This is a list of the counties in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, with population and county seats (known in the province as shire towns). Before New Brunswick was partitioned from Nova Scotia, it consisted of Cumberland and Sunbury Counties. Counties were at the top of a three-layer local government system. Below each county were parishes (townships), Some, but not all, parishes were then further subdivided into municipalities. The exception to this was the municipality of Saint John which was not in a parish but was a sub-division of Saint John County. With the New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program in 1966, county councils were abolished. Counties continue to be used as an organizational unit, along with parishes, for registration of real-estate and its taxation. They figure prominently in residents' sense of place and continue as significant threads in the Province's cultural fabric (i.e., most citizens always know which county they are in).

During the late 1990s a cottage subdivision called Island Estates was established on the island, which saw a new boat launch, the present golf course and numerous new cottages established. When Island Estates was established electricity became available on several areas of the island, with potential for future expansion. The island contains many secluded beaches along its perimeter and has a natural deep-water cove which provides excellent shelter for boaters needing safe harbour to lay in overnight. Originally Kennebecasis Island supported five farms: Hutchings, Morrow, Keith and two McCormick. There was also a one-room schoolhouse, a post office, a commercial river-boat landing and a small hotel where, during the early 1900s, visitors wanting a reprieve from the heavy industrial environment in Saint John would stay on weekends. Today most of the original building stock and infrastructure is gone with the exception of McCormick House, which is the only farm remaining with its original land allotment and farm house still intact. The most famous Kennebecasis Islander was Hugh J. McCormick, a professional speed skater from 1883 until 1895.
