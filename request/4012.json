Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate, or when many French Baroque features are present (Second Empire).\n The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English Wollaton Hall, Italian Palazzo Pitti, the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, and the Russian Palace of Facets\u2014all deemed Renaissance\u2014illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.",
