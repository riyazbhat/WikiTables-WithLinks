The clan, originally known as the Kakizaki clan (\u8823\u5d0e\u6c0f), had settled in Kakizaki, Kawauchi, Mutsu on the Shimokita Peninsula. Claiming descent from the Takeda clan of Wakasa Province, the family later took the name Matsumae. In exchange for their service in defending the country, the Matsumae were made exempt from owing rice to the shogunate in tribute, and from the sankin-k\u014dtai system, under which most daimy\u014ds (feudal lords of Edo period Japan) were required to spend half the year at Edo, while their families spent the entire year at Edo and were, essentially, held hostage to prevent rebellion. [citation needed]\n Due to their location, and their role as border defenders, the Matsumae were the first Japanese to negotiate with Russia in any way. They may well have been the first Japanese to meet Russians at all within Japanese territory.

In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance. Archaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE, during the latter part of the Kofun period, and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals.

Like other celebrated dramas such as the Maodori-hasi and Ibaraki, it is based on the legend of Watanabe no Tsuna and the demon of Rash\u014dmon. The title is a pun, which involves the Raj\u014dmon outer castle gate but Kanze changed it by using the kanji sh\u014d for life rather than the original j\u014d for castle. It is one of the few Noh plays where the supporting waki (\u8107) rather than the normally leading shite (\u4ed5\u624b) dominates the action. It is suggested that this can be attributed to the fact that Nobumitsu used to play waki roles when he was an actor. The shite character in this play only makes an appearance at the end and has no dialogue. Rash\u014dmon is also a play which follows characters from one venue to another. Act 1 takes place in the dining hall of a general, but in Act 2 the waki character, Tsuna, climbs the Rasho Gate to determine the truth of a story that a demon resides on the gate top.",

Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably, n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen. Traditionally, a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today. Optionally, an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation. Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story. Noh integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts, women, children, and the elderly.",

Its contents are nevertheless not at all similar to the formal, symbolic, and solemn Noh theater; ky\u014dgen is a comic form, and its primary goal is to make its audience laugh. Ky\u014dgen together with Noh is part of N\u014dgaku theatre.
