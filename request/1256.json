  "/wiki/Abbey_Mills_Mosque": "The Abbey Mills Mosque, also known as the London Markaz or Masjid-e-Ilyas, is a temporary mosque located in Stratford, east London, accommodating around 2,500 people. Plans were made to expand the capacity of the mosque to what would have been the largest religious building in Britain \u2013  three times the size of St Paul's Cathedral \u2013  and one of the largest mosques in western Europe. For this reason the proposed building is often informally referred to in the press as the mega-mosque. The mosque extension was to have been built by Tablighi Jamaat, near the site of the London 2012 Olympic Park. Anjuman-e-Islahul Muslimeen,Tablighi Jamaat's charitable trust, has been the owner of the site since 1996. The Tablighi Jamaat website devoted to the mosque places the maximum capacity at 12,000 worshipers. The plan sparked controversy for various reasons, including its initially reported size and the possible chemical contamination risk associated with the site. Mosque officials are engaged in resolving the controversies, as well as countering the perception implied by the term mega-mosque.",

  "/wiki/Sunni_Muslim": "Sunni Islam (/\u02c8su\u02d0ni, \u02c8s\u028ani/) is the largest denomination of Islam, followed by 87\u201390% of the world's Muslims. Its name comes from the word sunnah, referring to the behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions. According to Sunni traditions, Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph. This contrasts with the Shia view, which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor, most notably at Ghadir Khumm. Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism. The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jam\u0101\u02bbah (the people of the sunnah and the community) or ahl as-sunnah for short. In English, its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism, while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims, Sunnis, Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah.",

The root of the word is \u02beadhina \u0623\u064e\u0630\u0650\u0646\u064e meaning to listen, to hear, be informed about. Another derivative of this word is \u02beudhun (\u0623\u064f\u0630\u064f\u0646), meaning ear. Adhan is called out by a mu'azzin from the mosque five times a day, traditionally from the minaret, summoning Muslims for obligatory (fard) prayer (salat). A second call, known as the Iqamah then summons Muslims to line up for the beginning of the prayers. The main purpose behind the multiple loud pronouncements of adhan in every mosque is to make available to everyone an easily intelligible summary of Islamic belief. [citation needed]  In modern times, loudspeakers have been installed on minarets for this purpose.
