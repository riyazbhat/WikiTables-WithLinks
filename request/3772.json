  "/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh": "The University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) is a state-related research university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Pitt was founded as the Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on the edge of the American frontier. It developed and was renamed as Western University of Pennsylvania by a change to its charter in 1819. After surviving two devastating fires and various relocations within the area, the school moved to its current location in the Oakland neighborhood of the city; it was renamed as the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966 when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education. The university is composed of 17 undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its urban Pittsburgh campus, home to the university's central administration and 28,391 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The university also includes four undergraduate schools located at campuses within Western Pennsylvania: Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus has multiple contributing historic buildings of the Schenley Farms Historic District, most notably its 42-story Gothic revival centerpiece, the Cathedral of Learning.",

In 2016, the Tribune-Review moved to an all-digital format. The Post-Gazette moved to publishing five print editions a week in 2018 and three print editions a week in 2019. The alternative papers in the region include the Pittsburgh City Paper; The Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh; The New People, published weekly by the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Social Justice; the New Pittsburgh Courier, one of the larger ethnic publications in the region; and Zajedni\u010dar, the only Croatian-language newspaper currently published in the United States. The Pitt News, a financially independent student-written and -managed newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh, is closing in on its 100th year of publication. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law also hosts JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service."
