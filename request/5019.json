Built in 1900 to accommodate travelers to the Nome area during the Nome Gold Rush, it was soon expanded.  It has a profile resembling that of a typical New England saltbox house, although its main entrance is on what would normally be considered the side of such a building.  Its oldest portion is a log structure, which was expanded with lumber wood framing, and the whole building is now covered with clapboard siding.  It is the only structure surviving from the route of a 650-mile (1,050\u00a0km) delivery of diphtheria serum in 1925 achieved by a relay of dogsled teams.  The roadhouse declined with the advent of aviation to the area, and was used as an orphanage, a military communications facility during World War II, and saw used in the later 20th century as a retail establishment.",

The installation later became the endpoint of the WAMCATS cable, a military communications cable extending across Alaska.  Its importance declined substantially after the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1923, providing year-round service to the interior which was superior to the seasonal transport service of the river.  The post was closed in 1925, and the military burials of its graveyard relocated to Sitka National Cemetery in 1929.

Commanded by the explorer Roald Amundsen and its Italian maker, Umberto Nobile, the airship flew from Spitsbergen, Norway on May 10, and made for Nome after crossing the pole.  Frustrated by fog and bad weather, the ship was landed instead at Teller, about 72 miles (116\u00a0km) from Nome, landing on Front Avenue near this building.

The dredge was built in San Francisco, California, shipped to Nome, and placed in operation in 1946 by Walter Johnson.  The economics associated with the cost of its construction and shipment, as compared to the price of gold, worked against Johnson, who only operated it for a single season before it was seized by a local bank.
