The interior of the new church was 78 feet long, 46 feet wide and 32 feet high, with round-headed windows. James Peller Malcolm called Wren\u2019s church \"so plain as to be indescribable\", noting only the Corinthian  reredos, \"the usual tablets\" and the lack of an organ. There was a Portland stone tower, about 100 feet high, topped with a perforated parapet, with vases at its angles, and a spire\u2014described by James Elmes as \"remarkably picturesque\"\u2014with clock, weather-vane and cross.\n The church was demolished in 1831 to make way for the wider approaches needed for the rebuilt London Bridge. Its parish was united with that of St Magnus the Martyr. A stained-glass window in the church of St Magnus commemorates the former parish.\n Washington Irving gave a long description of the church in his famed work The Sketch Book (published originally in 1863, republished by Avenal Books/Crown Publishers in 1985), in the chapter entitled \"The Boar's Head Tavern, Eastcheap\". In searching for any remnants of Shakespeare's Falstaff, Irving hears about a picture of the original tavern in St. Michael's church, but to no avail.

It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title \"Cardinal Rector\", being the last remaining cleric in the Church of England to use the title Cardinal.\n St Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.\n St Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.\n Its prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature.  In Oliver Twist Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, \"the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom\". The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, \"the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold\". He added in a footnote that \"the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren's interiors\". One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its \"splendour\"; later he appreciated its \"utility\" when he came there as a sinner.",
