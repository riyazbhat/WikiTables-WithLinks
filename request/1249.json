Gifu continued to flourish even after Japan's unification as both an important shukuba along the Edo period Nakasend\u014d and, later, as one of Japan's fashion centers. It has been designated a core city by the national government.",

Rivers subject to frequent flooding in this area included the Kiso River, Nagara River and Ibi River near Nagoya.
