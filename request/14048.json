  "/wiki/Dog_Day_Afternoon": "Dog Day Afternoon is a 1975 American neo-noir crime drama film directed by Sidney Lumet, written by Frank Pierson, and produced by Martin Bregman and Martin Elfand. Starring Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Broderick, and Charles Durning, it chronicles the events following a bank robbery committed by Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) and Salvatore Naturale (Cazale). Inspired by a LIFE magazine article The Boys in the Bank by P. F. Kluge, Dog Day Afternoon is largely a dramatization of the 1972 bank robbery masterminded by John Wojtowicz. Despite this, Wojtowicz claimed a number of the film's events contained inaccuracies. Dog Day Afternoon is notable for its anti-establishment tone, and marks the third collaboration between Pacino and Cazale, after The Godfather. It is the final film released in Cazale's lifetime (The Deer Hunter was released after his death), and its title refers to the sultry dog days of summer. The film contains no musical score, bar the appearance of three diegetic songs. The majority of Dog Day Afternoon was shot on location in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn; near the site of the actual bank robbery. Although the film follows the basic text of the script as written by Pierson, Lumet encouraged the actors to improvise and workshop scenes to facilitate naturalistic dialogue. Dog Day Afternoon was released in the United States on September 21, 1975, and received universal acclaim for the performances of its cast, its directing, and its screenplay. It retrospectively saw praise for its approach to transgenderism and bisexuality. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and seven Golden Globe awards, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.",

Film critic Roger Ebert described him as one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors.

A member of the maiden cohort of New York's Actors Studio, Lumet began his directorial career in Off-Broadway productions, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie, 12 Angry Men (1957), was a courtroom drama centered on a tense jury deliberation. Lumet subsequently divided his energies among political and social drama films, as well as adaptations of literary plays and novels, big stylish stories, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City.

This did not stop him from becoming one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million records.

The film is a loose adaptation of the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade, set during World War II, and was Pasolini's final film, being released three weeks after his murder. The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian libertines, in the time of the fascist Republic of Sal\u00f2 (1943-1945). The libertines kidnap 18 teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, murder, sadism and sexual and mental torture. The film explores the themes of political corruption, consumerism, capitalism, nihilism, morality, abuse of power, social darwinism, sadism, sexuality and fascism. The story is in four segments, inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Excrement, and the Circle of Blood. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 book On the Genealogy of Morality, Ezra Pound's poem The Cantos, and Marcel Proust's novel sequence In Search of Lost Time. Premiering at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975, the film had a brief theatrical run in Italy before being banned in January 1976 and was released in the United States the following year on 3 October 1977. Because it depicts youths subjected to intensely graphic violence, relentless sadism, sexual deviance and brutal murder, the film was extremely controversial upon its release and has remained banned in several countries into the 21st century. The confluence of thematic content in the film - ranging from the political and socio-historical, to psychological and sexual - has led to much critical discussion of the film. It has been both praised and decried by various film historians and critics and was named the 65th scariest film ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006. It is also the subject of an entry in The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986).",
