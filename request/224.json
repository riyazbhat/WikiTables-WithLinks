According to an architectural survey completed in 1988, the auditorium is almost unique in being only one of two known WPA buildings constructed for sole use as auditoriums rather than as dual-use auditoriums and gymnasiums. (Much more common elsewhere in the county and Oklahoma was the dual-use auditorium and gymnasium, such as the WPA built elsewhere in the county in Antlers, Oklahoma, Moyers, Oklahoma and Rattan, Oklahoma.) Art Deco was the prevalent architectural style during the 1930s, and the auditorium shows hints of it through its angular lines. The building is a single story T-shaped structure built of native untooled and uncoursed stone.",
