  "/wiki/Motorola_Aura": "Motorola Aura (styled AURA) is a series of luxury mobile phones from Motorola, and is part of the 4LTR line, announced in October 2008 and made available by December. Though it was going to be a series, only one phone was released, known as Aura R1. However, three further special editions of the Aura R1 were released through 2009: Aura Diamoniqe Edition, Aura Celestial Edition and Aura Diamond Edition. Aura is a luxury device with US$2000 price tag. It is made from premium materials such as stainless steel and sapphire and comes inside a wooden box. The phone featured a unique high-resolution circular display with 300dpi and an adapted circular user interfaced based on Motorola's MotoMagx operating system. One of the main selling points of the device apart from its screen was its swivel-like opening mechanism. This was thanks to its Swiss-made gears composed of Rockwell 50-55 hardened steel and 130 precision ball bearings. Its custom-engineered rotating mechanism is composed of more than 200 high-precision individual parts, and the gears are protected against harsh conditions with the same coatings used in high-performance racing engines.",
  "/wiki/GSM": "The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets. It was first deployed in Finland in December 1991. By the mid-2010s, it became a global standard for mobile communications achieving over 90% market share, and operating in over 193 countries and territories. 2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks. The GSM standard originally described a digital, circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE). Subsequently, the 3GPP developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards, followed by fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced standards, which do not form part of the ETSI GSM standard. GSM is a trade mark owned by the GSM Association. It may also refer to the (initially) most common voice codec used, Full Rate.",

  "/wiki/CDMA": "Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies. CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel. This allows several users to share a band of frequencies (see bandwidth). To permit this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code). CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards. IS-95, also called cdmaOne, and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply referred to as CDMA, but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers, also uses wideband CDMA, or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA, as its radio technologies.",

  "/wiki/W-CDMA": "The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM standard. Developed and maintained by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), UMTS is a component of the International Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne technology. UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and bandwidth to mobile network operators. UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the radio access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of users via SIM (subscriber identity module) cards. The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA) or 3GSM. Unlike EDGE (IMT Single-Carrier, based on GSM) and CDMA2000 (IMT Multi-Carrier), UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations.",
  "/wiki/Motorola_Hint_QA30": "Motorola Hint QA30 is a sliding mobile camera phone introduced by Motorola in the fourth quarter of 2008. It was available on Alltel, Bell Canada, Cricket, MetroPCS, and US Cellular. It is no longer supported by carriers due to relying on the outdated CDMA. About the size of a post-it note, the QA30 slides open to reveal a full QWERTY keyboard for text messaging and email. The 2 megapixel camera stores 1600x1200 resolution pictures on either the 128 MB internal memory or on a MicroSD card up to 8 GB.",

  "/wiki/Motorola_RAZR_V3": "The Motorola Razr (styled RAZR, pronounced /\u02c8re\u026az\u0259/ like razor; sometimes also Siliqua) was a series of mobile phones by Motorola, part of the 4LTR line. The V3 was the first phone released in the series and was introduced in July 2004 and released in the market in the third quarter of 2004. The V3 model was followed soon thereafter by the much improved V3i with a collaboration with Apple Inc. for iTunes to be built-in. Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone. But, within a year, its price was lowered and as a result it sold over 50 million units by July 2006. Leading up to the release, Motorola's Cell phone division sales were stagnant and losing money. This success made the division profitable again. Over the Razr's four-year run, the V3 model sold more than 130 million units, becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world to date. The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeeding Motorola Razr2 series was released. The succeeding models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m. However, Razr2 sales were not as good as the original, with consumers moving to competing products. Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones, the Razr appeal declined, leading Motorola to eventually drop behind Samsung and LG in market share for mobile phones.",

  "/wiki/Motorola_RAZR\u00b2": "The Motorola Razr2 (often stylized as RAZR2) is a series of clamshell/flip mobile phones from Motorola, and is one of the series in the 4LTR line. It is the successor to the popular Razr series. The Razr2 is 2 mm thinner than its predecessor but slightly wider. Some versions feature Motorola's MotoMagx operational platform, based on the MontaVista Linux OS. The Razr2 was made available on every US carrier, and EVDO, GSM and HSDPA versions of it were released by late 2007. The phone improved picture quality, speed and multimedia capabilities over the original Razr. It also featured an external screen with touch sensitive buttons which allowed users to use some of the phone features without opening the flip, and Motorola's CrystalTalk technology to improve call quality and help reduce background noise. Different color variants were released, including a Luxury Edition Razr2. It features a Micro-B USB socket for charging, data transfer or the stereo headset (S280 / syn1458B).",
