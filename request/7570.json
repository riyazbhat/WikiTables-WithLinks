West Virginia is the 41st largest state by area, and is ranked 38th in population. The capital and largest city is Charleston. West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861, at the start of the American Civil War. Delegates from the Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia, which also included secessionist counties in the new state. West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863, and was a key border state during the war. It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state, the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts, and was one of two states admitted to the Union during the American Civil War (the other being Nevada). While a portion of its residents held slaves, most of the residents were yeoman farmers, and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state Constitution. The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the Southern United States. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies the state as a part of the Mid-Atlantic region.

  "/wiki/Gilberts_Corner,_VA": "Gilberts Corner is an unincorporated area at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 15 in Loudoun County, Virginia located in Aldie, east of the historic Village of Aldie. There are no residences at this intersection, however, its name is attributed to the surrounding area. Gilberts Corner is named after the gas station/restaurant that sits at the northeast quadrant of the crossroads. It gained prominence in the 1920s when the Carolina Road (now Watson Road) was a toll road and U.S. Route 15 was extended south from Leesburg to U.S. Route 50. Due to increased traffic from toll evaders, U.S. Route 15 eventually was extended even farther south. The gas station/restaurant closed in the 1980s and is currently in the process of being renovated. Due to heavy traffic in the area, many commuters avoided the intersection altogether by going through Lenah and taking U.S. Route 15 south.",
  "/wiki/Potomac_River": "The Potomac River (/p\u0259\u02c8to\u028am\u0259k/ (listen)) is found within the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and flows from the Potomac Highlands into the Chesapeake Bay. The river (main stem and North Branch) is approximately 405 miles (652 km) long, with a drainage area of about 14,700 square miles (38,000 km2). In terms of area, this makes the Potomac River the fourth largest river along the Atlantic coast of the United States and the 21st largest in the United States. Over 5 million people live within the Potomac watershed. The river forms part of the borders between Maryland and Washington, D.C., on the left descending bank and West Virginia and Virginia on the river's right descending bank. The majority of the lower Potomac River is part of Maryland. Exceptions include a small tidal portion within the District of Columbia, and the border with Virginia being delineated from point to point (thus various bays and shoreline indentations lie in Virginia). Except for a small portion of its headwaters in West Virginia, the North Branch Potomac River is considered part of Maryland to the low water mark on the opposite bank. The South Branch Potomac River lies completely within the state of West Virginia except for its headwaters, which lie in Virginia.",
  "/wiki/Point_of_Rocks,_MD": "Point of Rocks is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,466.

The formation is not visible from the town and can only be seen from boats on the river, or from the southern bank of the river in Virginia."
