  "/wiki/Cement_City_Historic_District": "Cement City Historic District is a historic district in Donora, Pennsylvania. The district includes 80 Prairie School concrete residences built in 1916-17. The homes served as housing for employees of the American Steel and Wire Company. Poured-in-place concrete houses had become popular in large-scale housing developments at the time, partly thanks to promotion by Thomas Edison; the homes built in Donora used a newly patented construction method from the Lambie Concrete House Corporation. Building the houses required a combined 10,000 barrels of Portland cement. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 1997, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker on McKean Ave. (Pa. 837) in South Donora, noting the historic importance of the community.

  "/wiki/Donora,_Pennsylvania": "Donora is a borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States, approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of Pittsburgh on the Monongahela River. Donora was incorporated in 1901. It got its name from a combination of William Donner and Nora Mellon, banker Andrew W. Mellon's wife. The borough's nickname is \"The Home of Champions\", mainly because of the large number of famous athletes who have called Donora their home. Agriculture, coal-mining, steel-making, wire-making, and other industries were conducted in Donora early in its history. In 1910, 8,174 people lived in Donora; in 1920, 14,131; and in 1940, 13,180. According to U.S. census figures, the population was 5,653 in 2000 and 4,781 in 2010. Donora is a Rust Belt location which has lost most of its industrial capacity.",

In 1984, the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation succeeded in having a section of East Washington consisting of 120 Victorian houses added to the National Register of Historic Places. Washington & Jefferson College was opposed to the designation, but filed an objection too late in the proceedings. College President Howard J. Burnett said that the district \"was structured to prevent expansion of the college.\" At issue was the college's plan to expand eastward towards the Wade Avenue area, a plan that was developed in the 1968 \"Master Plan.\" Since then, the college has had a policy of purchasing homes in that area when they become available. The college has purchased and demolished a number of buildings listed in the historic district, including 308, 314 and 322 E. Wheeling Street, which made way for the Burnett Center.",

For the next 30 years, the college maintained a policy of purchasing any homes in that area as they became available."
