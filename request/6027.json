It has a population of 179,601 (1 January 2019), and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located 45 kilometres (28 mi) north of Svendborg, 144 kilometres (89 mi) to the south of Aarhus and 167 kilometres (104 mi) to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years, although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988, and by 1070, it had already grown into a thriving city. Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 10 July 1086. Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry, it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages. After a period of decline, large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century, which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense, facilitating trade. In 1865, one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built, further increasing the population and commerce, and by 1900, Odense had reached a population of 35,000. Odense's Odinst\u00e5rnet was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built in 1935 but was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II.",

The hot water tank contains 19,000 m3, suitable for 15 hours of cold weather consumption. The station is to be used as a hub for distributing district heating from the coming Apple data center near Foulum and Tjele. Consultants calculate that the best economy for Viborg's district heating is a system where Apple's cooling water is used to provide heat for 7 MWe heat pumps at the data center delivering 55 MJ/s of heating (and cooling for Apple), with an overall Coefficient of performance of 8. The transmission water temperature is raised from 30 to 50 \u00b0C and then pipelined 10 km to Viborg, where further heat pumps raise (and keep) the local heat to 60 \u00b0C. The start cost is estimated at DKK 316 million, and running costs of DKK 265/MWh, compared to the 2017 price of DKK 413/MWh and natural gas at over DKK 500/MWh. Conversely, Apple's cooling water is lowered in temperature by the heat pumps. Viborg's expected heat demand is between 10 MJ/s in summer and 90 MJ/s (peak) in winter, for an annual consumption of 307 GWh.
