Given free creative license by Nintendo, the screenwriters envisioned the film as a subversive comedy with a weird and dark tone similar to Ghostbusters (1984); the setting was primarily inspired by Super Mario World (1990), with other elements drawn from fairy tales and contemporary American culture. Released on May 28, 1993, the film was unsuccessful critically and financially, grossing $20.9 million domestically against a budget of $48 million. Reviewers praised the film for its innovative special effects, creative artistic direction, and the performances of its actors, but criticized the confusing narrative, lack of similarity to the games and inconsistent tone; Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto opined that while there was effort put into the film, the end result tried too hard to replicate the game series.

In the early 1960s, he performed as a stand-up comedian, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes, where he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish, which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality.

By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s, and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present. He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late 1970s. Allen often stars in his films, typically in the persona he developed as a standup.

Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer Gordon Willis, as a major turning point, in that unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of Jewish identity, and the elements of psychoanalysis and modernism. Annie Hall was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival in March 1977, before its official release on April 20, 1977.
