  "/wiki/Castle_Shannon_Incline": "The Castle Shannon Incline was a funicular railroad in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was originally part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad route to the suburb of Castle Shannon. It replaced an earlier incline dating to 1825 that brought coal down from a mine in Mount Washington. Initially opened on 26 August 1890, the incline operated for only a few days before breaking down, the original machinery being unable to bear the strain of the large freight and passenger cars. After a second abortive run in October, it was decided that the machinery had to be replaced. The refitted incline opened on 7 March 1891. It ran from Bailey Avenue west of Haberman Avenue down to Carson Street just west of Arlington Avenue.",

It had 666 PCC cars, the third largest fleet in North America (after Toronto (745) and Chicago (683)).  It had 68 streetcar routes, of which only three (until April 5, 2010, the 42 series, the 47 series, and 52) are used by the Port Authority as light rail routes.  With the Port Authority's Transit Development Plan, many route names will be changed to its original, such as the 41D Brookline becoming the 39 Brookline.

  "/wiki/Pittsburgh_and_Castle_Shannon_Railroad": "The Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was a 3\u00a0ft\u00a04\u00a0in (1,016\u00a0mm) narrow-gauge railroad in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.  Originally built in 1871, it may have been the first American common-carrier narrow-gauge railroad.   It purchased a rail line called the Coal Hill Coal Railroad from the Pittsburgh Coal Company, and used a coal mine under Mt. Washington  as a tunnel to transport coal from Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh.  Passenger traffic was added soon afterwards, and the train carried passengers during the day and coal at night.  The original plan was to extend the line to Finleyville, Pennsylvania, but the original narrow-gauge line ran only as far as Castle Shannon. The right of way continued as the Pittsburgh, Castle Shannon and Washington Railroad, later to become part of the Pittsburgh Southern Railroad.",

Emergency use of the plane for passengers and freight continued as late as 1900.  Its use for the transport of passengers and freight other than coal was made obsolete by the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel.

The upper station was on Salisbury Street across from the former Fort Laughlin site eventually occupied by Arlington Playground.\nThe incline was 2,060\u00a0ft (628\u00a0m) long, with a vertical rise of 361\u00a0ft (110\u00a0m). It was designed by engineer J. H. McRoberts. As it carried both freight and passengers over steep tracks laid on the ground, it could be considered to be a cable railway. Its path was not of constant slope but became progressively steeper toward the top, tracing a parabolic arc. It is uncertain exactly when the incline closed permanently, but it was reported as shut down in a 1932 Associated Press article about the \"passing\" of Pittsburgh's inclines.

Never very profitable, it shut down in fall 1898 and was razed a decade later. A building now standing at 1733 Lowrie Street was long thought to have been the summit station, but later research found that the building did not appear on maps until well after the incline closed.
