  "/wiki/1964_Summer_Olympics": "The 1964 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVIII Olympiad (Japanese: \u7b2c\u5341\u516b\u56de\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u7af6\u6280\u5927\u4f1a, Hepburn: Dai J\u016bhachi-kai Orinpikku Ky\u014dgi Taikai), was an international multi-sport event held in Tokyo, Japan, from 10 to 24 October 1964. Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but this honour was subsequently passed to Helsinki because of Japan's invasion of China, before ultimately being cancelled because of World War II. The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia, and the first time South Africa was barred from taking part due to its apartheid system in sports. (South Africa was, however, allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics, also held in Tokyo, where it made its Paralympic Games debut.) Tokyo was chosen as the host city during the 55th IOC Session in West Germany, on 26 May 1959. These games were also the first to be telecast internationally without the need for tapes to be flown overseas, as they had been for the 1960 Olympics four years earlier. The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3, the first geostationary communication satellite, and from there to Europe using Relay 1. These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts, albeit partially. Certain events like the sumo wrestling and judo matches, sports huge in Japan, were tried out using Toshiba's new colour transmission system, but only for the domestic market. History surrounding the 1964 Olympics was chronicled in the 1965 documentary film Tokyo Olympiad, directed by Kon Ichikawa. The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city's midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season. The previous Olympics in Rome in 1960 started in late August and experienced hot weather.",

Vilhj\u00e1lmur grew up in the East-Icelandic fishing village of Rey\u00f0arfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and was the son of Einar Stef\u00e1nsson and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Vilhj\u00e1lmsd\u00f3ttir. In 1956 Vilhj\u00e1lmur set a new Olympic Record by jumping 16.26 m in the triple jump, only to be surpassed by Brazil's Adhemar da Silva in the same competition. This was the most unexpected result of the Olympics that year, and his silver medal was Iceland's first ever Olympic medal. In 1958 he took bronze in the triple jump at the European Athletics Championships in Stockholm, Sweden, with 16.00 m. His personal best was 16.70 m set in 1960 in Laugardalsv\u00f6llur, Iceland. He was named Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year five times, more times than anyone else. Vilhj\u00e1lmur was also a headmaster of three schools: H\u00e9ra\u00f0ssk\u00f3linn in Laugarvatn, Reykholtssk\u00f3li in Reykholt, and Menntask\u00f3linn in Egilssta\u00f0ir, where he later worked as a part-time mathematics teacher. He also was a painter, specializing in landscape painting, and his work has been on display in several art galleries in Iceland. He attended Dartmouth College. His son Einar Vilhj\u00e1lmsson later represented Iceland in the men's javelin throw at the Summer Olympics (1984, 1988 and 1992).",
  "/wiki/1956_Summer_Olympics": "The 1956 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event that was held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia from 22 November to 8 December 1956, with the exception of the equestrian events, which were held in Stockholm, Sweden in June 1956. These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania, as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America. Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics. Due to the Southern Hemisphere's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year, because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host's spring/summer (which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere's autumn/winter). The Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia's strict quarantine regulations, so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier. This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country, the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were held in Antwerp, Belgium, with some events taking place in Ostend, Belgium and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations, the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success. The enduring tradition of national teams parading as one during the closing ceremony was started at these Olympics. Several teams boycotted the Games in protest of the IOC's rejection to suspend the USSR after their invasion of Hungary. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.",

In March 1912, during the 13th session of the IOC, Belgium's bid to host the 1920 Summer Olympics was made by Baron \u00c9douard de Laveleye, president of the Belgian Olympic Committee and of the Royal Belgian Football Association. No fixed host city was proposed at the time. The 1916 Summer Olympics, to be held in Berlin, capital of the German Empire, were cancelled due to World War I. The aftermath of the war and the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created, but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it. Hungary, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were banned from competing in the Games. Germany did not return to Olympic competition until 1928 and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche Kampfspiele, starting with the Winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics). The United States won the most gold and overall medals. The sailing events were held in Ostend, Belgium, and two in Amsterdam, Netherlands.",

In 1916 he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, and served there during World War I. He then went to the University of Southern California for one year and then transferred to Dartmouth College. He graduated from there in 1922. In 1918, he had already won the AAU championships in the high hurdles, and in 1920, he set a new world record in the 110 m hurdles, running 14.4. This record would remain unbeaten until 1931, although it was equaled a number of times. He sought to represent the United States at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, but was ruled ineligible due to his Canadian citizenship. He then joined the Canadian Olympic team.
