  "/wiki/Topographic_prominence": "In topography, prominence[a] measures the height of a mountain or hill's summit relative to the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it. It is a measure of the independence of a summit. A peak's key col (highest gap between two mountains) is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain, selected according to various criteria.",
  "/wiki/Ringelspitz": "The Ringelspitz (also known as Piz Barghis) is a mountain of the Glarus Alps, located on the border between the Swiss cantons of St. Gallen and Graub\u00fcnden.

It is split between three municipalities: Pf\u00e4fers (St. Gallen), Trin and Tamins (Graub\u00fcnden).\n The Ringelspitz is the culminating point of a range, about 12 kilometres long, running from west to east and diverging from the main chain of the Glarus Alp between Piz Sardona and Piz Segnas. The massif separates the Calfeisen valley in canton St. Gallen from the Rhine valley near Flims.
