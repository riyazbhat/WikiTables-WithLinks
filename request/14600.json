  "/wiki/NY_414": "New York State Route\u00a0414 (NY\u00a0414) is a north\u2013south state highway in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York in the United States. It extends for 83.20 miles (133.90\u00a0km) from an intersection with NY\u00a0352 in the Steuben County city of Corning to a junction with NY\u00a0104 in the Wayne County town of Huron. NY\u00a0414 spans five counties and roughly parallels NY\u00a014 between Watkins Glen and Huron. It intersects every major east\u2013west arterial in western New York, including the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate\u00a086 (I-86) and NY 17), U.S. Route\u00a020 (US\u00a020) and NY 5, and the New York State Thruway (I-90). The route passes through mostly rural areas as it travels between the several villages and cities along its routing.\n In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the portion of modern NY\u00a0414 south of Seneca Falls was designated as part of New York State Route\u00a044, a route extending from Caton to Wolcott, while most of what is now NY\u00a0414 north of Seneca Falls became part of NY\u00a089. NY\u00a044 was renumbered to NY\u00a0414 c.\u20091935 to eliminate numerical duplication with US\u00a044. NY\u00a0414 was shifted onto its current alignment between Seneca Falls and Huron on April 30, 1959, placing it on what had been NY\u00a089 north of the hamlet of Magee and New York State Route\u00a089A between Magee and the overlapped routes of US\u00a020 and NY\u00a05.",
