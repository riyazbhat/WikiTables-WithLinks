He made twenty-nine films, including L'amour fou (1969), Out 1 (1971), Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974), and La Belle Noiseuse (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times. Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker, Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty. He moved to Paris to pursue his career, frequenting Henri Langlois' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs; there, he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, \u00c9ric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave. Rivette began writing film criticism, and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 1953. In his criticism, he expressed an admiration for American films - especially those of genre directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray - and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema. Rivette's articles, admired by his peers, were considered the magazine's best and most aggressive writings, particularly his 1961 article On Abjection and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut. He continued making short films, including Le Coup de Berger, which is often cited as the first New Wave film. Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement. Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film, Paris Belongs to Us was not released until 1961, by which time Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide. Rivette became editor of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film, The Nun (1966).",
