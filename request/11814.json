In 1996, the Stormers qualified and competed in the Super 12 as Western Province.

The club has the most supporters of any Currie Cup team.\n The Club is nicknamed Die Streeptruie (\"The Striped Jerseys\" in Afrikaans) in reference to their legendary blue and white hooped jerseys. These Striped Jerseys were the colours of Malmesbury Rugby Football Club, established in 1881. They are also known simply as \"Province\" by all South African rugby lovers, while Afrikaans-speaking supporters also refer to the team by its abbreviation, W.P. (pronounced: \"vee pee\" [\"ee\" as in \"beer\"]).\n Western Province were the 2012 Vodacom Cup Champions, having defeated the Griquas in 2012 by 20 points to 18. They also are the 2014 Currie cup champions, having defeated the Lions 19\u201316 in the final. Western Province is the only South African Team besides the Blue Bulls to have appeared in every final of every competition in South African rugby: the Vodacom Cup, the Lion Cup, the Absa Nite Series, the Currie Cup and the Super Rugby Competitions (as the DHL Stormers).\n Another accomplishment of Western Province, which no South African team has ever been able to match, is the double victories over the All Blacks the first being (10\u20133) played on 15 August 1928 and again (12\u201311) on 16 July 1976, while several countries have never been able to beat the All Black team, Province managed this feat.

Province has also beaten the Wallabies 17\u20136 in a thrilling encounter in 1963. Province has also drawn to other countries including England in 1984 with a score of 15 all, however province has beaten the British and Irish Lions numerous times, including three times in 1903 and won another match in 1924, the match then had been regarded as \"test\" status. The only two teams to have beaten overseas countries as well as combination teams (Lions) are yet again the Blue Bulls and Western Province. Province was unstoppable by any other opposition in the 1980s except for Northern Transvaal. Among the ten Currie Cup trophies in the 1980s 5 went to Province 4 went to Northern Transvaal and 1 was shared, this shows the dominance between the two teams and the constant intense rivalry between the unions.\n Since 1983 Western Province has been sponsored by Adidas, in 2013 this will mark the 30th Anniversary of the sponsorship and the 130th anniversary of the team itself. In 1983 Province launched their centenary jersey of which 50 only ever came into existence, but this is not the rarest province top, the rarest being a complete maroon kit of which only 15 were ever made, this team played under the WP Presidents XV. The maroon jersey along with the centenary jersey as well as the original Stormers orange tops are the three most sought after Province and or Stormers tops.\n Team sponsor DHL has officially renewed their sponsorship with Western Province until 2016, following an emphatic 2012 season.\n Western Province currently combines with Boland Cavaliers to compete as the DHL Stormers in the Super Rugby competition.",
