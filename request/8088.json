In terms of size it is the fourth largest granitic island of Seychelles after Mah\u00e9, Praslin and Silhouette Island. It has a population of 2,800 people, who mostly live in the west coast villages of La Passe (linked by ferry to Praslin and Mah\u00e9) and La R\u00e9union. There is no airport on La Digue, so to get there from a foreign country, one has to fly to Victoria and continue by ferry, usually via Praslin. It has an area of 10.08\u00a0km2, which makes it relatively easy to travel around by bike or on foot.\n La Digue was named after a ship in the fleet of French explorer Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, who visited the Seychelles in 1768.",

Praslin has a population of around 7,533 people and comprises two administrative districts: Baie Sainte Anne and Grand' Anse. The main settlements are the Baie Ste Anne, Anse Volbert and Grand' Anse.\n It was named Isle de Palmes by explorer Lazare Picault in 1744. During that time it was used as a hideaway by pirates and Arab merchants. In 1768 it was renamed Praslin in honor of French diplomat C\u00e9sar Gabriel de Choiseul, duc de Praslin.\n Praslin is known as a tourist destination with several hotels and resorts, as well as a number of beaches such as Anse Lazio and Anse Georgette.\n It has substantial tracts of tropical forests with birds such as the endemic Seychelles bulbul and the Seychelles black parrot. The Vall\u00e9e de Mai Nature Preserve, established in 1979, is known for the unique coco de mer and vanilla orchids. It has been reported that General Charles George Gordon of Khartoum (1833-1885) was convinced that Vall\u00e9e de Mai was the Biblical \"Garden of Eden\".[citation needed]\n Praslin is home to Praslin Island Airport, while surrounding islands include Curieuse Island, La Digue, Cousin Island, Cousine Island and Aride Island. There are a few near offshore islets including Round Island (0.193\u00a0km2) and Chauve Souris (0.007\u00a0km2), both of which have hotel accommodations.\n Twice in two weeks in August 2011 bull sharks entered the so-called 'safe bathing' area inside the coral reef of Anse Lazio and attacked and killed swimmers less than 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) from shore. However, to put this in perspective, these were the first recorded fatal shark attacks in Seychelles for 50 years and none have been recorded after 2011.\n A large area in the south of the island has been designated as Praslin National Park and surrounding areas Important Bird Area.",

The population of Mah\u00e9 was 77,000, as of the 2010 census. It contains the capital city of Victoria and accommodates 86% of the country's total population.  The island was named after Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, a French governor of  Isle de France (modern-day Mauritius).\n Mah\u00e9's tallest peak is Morne Seychellois at 905\u00a0m (2,969\u00a0ft), which lies in the Morne Seychellois National Park.  The northern and eastern parts of the island are home to much of the population and the Seychelles International Airport which opened in 1971. The southern and western parts have Baie Ternay Marine National Park, Port Launay Marine National Park, and University of Seychelles. The Sainte Anne Marine National Park lies offshore, as do Conception Island, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Island, Anonyme Island and several smaller islands.\n Mah\u00e9 was first visited by the British in 1609 and not visited by Europeans again until Lazare Picault's expedition of 1742. The French navy fr\u00e9gate Le Cerf (English: The Deer) arrived at Port Victoria on 1 November 1756. On board was Corneille Nicholas Morphey, leader of the French expedition, which claimed the island for the King of France by laying a Stone of Possession on Mahe, Seychelles\u2019 oldest monument, now on display in the National Museum, Victoria.\n In August 1801 a Royal Navy frigate HMS Sibylle captured the French frigate Chiffonne on the island. Mah\u00e9 remained a French possession until 1812 when it became a British colony. It remained a colony until 1976 when Seychelles became an independent nation.\n Mah\u00e9's forests have rare endemic plants found only in Seychelles, such as the critically endangered Medusagyne oppositifolia (the jellyfish tree), the carnivorous Nepenthes pervillei (Seychelles pitcher plant), and many unique species of orchid.\n Mah\u00e9 had a huge land reclamation project due to a shortage of housing, in the areas of Bel Ombre and the Port of Victoria.",
