He began playing football as a youngster with AIK Ba\u010dka Topola, and scored 68 goals from 76 first-team matches over a three-year period in the third tier of Yugoslav football. Military service took him to Bar in 2001, where he was able to continue his goalscoring career with the local second-level club Mornar. A brief spell back in the third tier with Kolubara preceded his turning professional with First League side Red Star Belgrade in January 2003. He spent time on loan at third-tier Spartak Subotica before making his Red Star debut later that year. Despite suggestions that his height, of 2.02 m (6 ft 7 1\u20442 in), made him better suited to sports other than football, \u017digi\u0107 ended the season as First League top scorer, domestic player of the year, league champion and scorer of the winning goal in the cup final. He won a second league-cup double in 2005-06, a second player of the year award, and finished his three-year Red Star career with 70 goals from 109 appearances in all competitions. In August 2006, \u017digi\u0107 signed for Spanish club Racing Santander; his goals and his partnership with Pedro Munitis helped them achieve a mid-table finish in La Liga. He then moved to Valencia, but was unable to establish himself as a regular in the starting eleven. He spent the second half of the 2008-09 La Liga season back with Racing on loan, for whom he scored 13 goals in just 19 matches. \u017digi\u0107 joined Birmingham City of the Premier League in 2010, and in his first season, he scored in their League Cup win.",
