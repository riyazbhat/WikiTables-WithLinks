  "/wiki/USS_Argus_(1803)": "The first USS Argus, originally named USS  Merrimack, was a brig in the United States Navy commissioned in 1803. She enforced the Embargo Act of 1807 and fought in the First Barbary War \u2013 taking part in the blockade of Tripoli and the capture of Derna \u2013 and the War of 1812. During the latter inflict, she had been audaciously raiding British merchant shipping in British home waters for a month, when the heavier British Cruizer-class brig-sloop HMS Pelican intercepted her. After a sharp fight during which Argus's captain, Master Commandant William Henry Allen, was mortally wounded, Argus surrendered when the crew of Pelican were about to board.",
  "/wiki/Brig": "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts. During the Age of Sail, brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels. They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind. Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail, while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail.",
  "/wiki/Isaac_Hull": "Isaac Hull (March 9, 1773 \u2013 February 13, 1843) was a Commodore in the United States Navy. He commanded several famous U.S. naval warships including USS Constitution (Old Ironsides) and saw service in the undeclared naval Quasi War with the revolutionary French Republic (France) 1796\u20131800; the Barbary Wars (1801\u20131805, 1815), with the Barbary states in North Africa; and the War of 1812 (1812\u20131815), for the second time with Great Britain. In the latter part of his career he was Commandant of the Washington Navy Yard in the national capital of Washington, D.C., and later the Commodore of the Mediterranean Squadron. For the infant U.S. Navy, the battle of USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere on August 19, 1812, at the beginning of the war, was the most important single ship action of the War of 1812 and one that made Isaac Hull a national hero.",
  "/wiki/USS_Constitution": "USS Constitution, also known as Old Ironsides, is a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She is the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel still afloat. [Note 1] She was launched in 1797, one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed. The name Constitution was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so Constitution and her sister ships were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. She was built at Edmund Hartt's shipyard in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. Her first duties were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War. Constitution is most noted for her actions during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom, when she captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships: HMS Guerriere, Java, Pictou, Cyane, and Levant.",
  "/wiki/Sailing_frigate_classification": "The Sailing frigate classification system used during the 19th Century was a classification scheme used in several western countries.  It was officially adopted by the United States Navy.  The system classified sailing frigates according to their gun rating.",
  "/wiki/John_H._Dent": "John Herbert Dent (15 February 1782 \u2013 31 July 1823) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War, the First Barbary War, and the War of 1812. He was acting captain on the USS Constitution (Old Ironsides) during the attacks on Tripoli in 1804.",
  "/wiki/Lieutenant": "A lieutenant (UK: /l\u025bf\u02c8t\u025bn\u0259nt/ lef-TEN-\u0259nt or US: /lu\u02d0\u02c8t\u025bn\u0259nt/ loo-TEN-\u0259nt abbreviated Lt, LT, Lieut and similar) is the second junior-most or in some cases the junior-most commissioned officer in the armed forces, fire services, police, and other organizations of many nations. The meaning of lieutenant differs in different militaries (see comparative military ranks), but is often subdivided into senior (first lieutenant) and junior (second lieutenant and even third lieutenant) ranks. In navies it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank. The rank is also used in fire services, emergency medical services, security services and police forces. Lieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure. It often designates someone who is second-in-command, and as such, may precede the name of the rank directly above it. For example, a lieutenant master is likely to be second-in-command to the master in an organisation using both ranks. Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments, and Quebec lieutenant in Canadian politics.",
  "/wiki/Flag_captain": "In the Royal Navy, a flag captain was the captain of an admiral's flagship. During the 18th and 19th centuries, this ship might also have a captain of the fleet, who would be ranked between the admiral and the flag captain as the ship's First Captain, with the flag captain as the ship's Second Captain.\n Unlike a captain of the fleet, a flag-captain was generally a fairly junior post-captain, as he had the admiral to keep an eye on him, but \u2013 like a captain of the fleet \u2013 a flag captain was a post rather than a rank.",
  "/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(1799)": "The third US ship to be named Enterprise was a schooner, built by Henry Spencer at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1799. Her first commander thought that she was too lightly built and that her quarters, in particular, should be bulletproofed. Enterprise was overhauled and rebuilt several times, effectively changing from a twelve-gun schooner to a fourteen-gun topsail schooner and eventually to a brig. Enterprise saw action in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean again, capturing numerous prizes. She wrecked in July 1823.",
  "/wiki/Schooner": "A schooner is a type of sailing ship, as defined by its rig configuration. Typically it has two or more masts, the foremast being slightly shorter than the mainmast. \n Pronounced /\u02c8sku\u02d0n\u0259r/, the term first appeared in eastern North America in the early 1700s. The name may be related to a Scots language word meaning to skip over water, or to skip stones.",

He was born on the eastern shore of Maryland in Worcester County, the son of a U.S. naval officer who served during the American Revolution. His father, Stephen Decatur Sr., was a commodore in the U.S. Navy, and brought the younger Stephen into the world of ships and sailing early on. Shortly after attending college, Decatur followed in his father's footsteps and joined the U.S. Navy at the age of nineteen as a midshipman. Decatur supervised the construction of several U.S. naval vessels, one of which he later commanded. Promoted at age 25, he is the youngest man to reach the rank of captain in the history of the United States Navy. He served under three presidents, and played a major role in the early development of the American navy. In almost every theater of operation, Decatur's service was characterized by acts of heroism and exceptional performance.",

The vessel was sold to Tripoli, which she served as Mastico. The bomb ketch was one of several Tripolitan vessels which captured Philadelphia on 31 October 1803 after the American frigate had run fast aground on uncharted Kaliusa reef some five miles (8 km) east of Tripoli.",
  "/wiki/Ketch": "A ketch is a two-masted sailboat whose mainmast is taller than the mizzen mast (or aft-mast),  generally in a 40-foot or bigger boat. The name ketch is derived from catch. The ketch's main mast is usually stepped in the same position as in a sloop. Its sail-plan is similar to that of a yawl, on which the mizzen mast is smaller and set further back. The addition of headsails can makes a cutter-ketch. In New England, in the 1600s the ketch was a small coastal craft. In the 1700s it disappeared from contemporary records, apparently replaced by the schooner. A ketch rig has an advantage over a sloop downwind, and in heavy winds where it has more variety of setups than a sloop, but is less efficient than a sloop upwind.",
