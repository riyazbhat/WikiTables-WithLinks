Team USA consisted of 230 athletes competing in all 15 sports. After winning an Olympic record 37 medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the United States had a somewhat disappointing performance during these games. Although the delegation ranked second in overall medals with 28, it ranked out of the top three in gold medals (with a total of nine) for the first time since Nagano in 1998 when it placed 6th in overall medals and 5th in gold medals. In long track speedskating, the U.S. matched its medal-less results from 1984 and 1956. In figure skating, the U.S. won no medals in the men's or women's singles events for the first time since 1936. Conversely, at the Sanki Sliding Center, the United States won more medals (seven) than any other nation. Steven Holcomb and Steven Langton won the first U.S. medal (a silver) in two-man bobsled in 62 years, while Erin Hamlin earned the first singles luge medal ever for the United States (also bronze).",

  "/wiki/Canada_at_the_2014_Winter_Olympics": "Canada competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from February 7 to 23, 2014. Canadians competed in every discipline except Nordic combined.\n The 2014 Games marked the first time a Canadian Olympic team competed in Russia, as Canada and 64 western countries did not take part at the American-led boycott in the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow due to the Soviet\u2013Afghan War.\n The youngest athlete in Canada's delegation was figure skater Gabrielle Daleman, who turned 16 in January, while curler Jennifer Jones was the oldest athlete at 39.\n Canada originally finished these Olympics with 10 gold medals and 25 overall (ranking 2nd and 3rd respectively). This is the second most successful Canadian performance ever, exceeded only by the achievements at the home Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. With the belated luge medal awarded in 2017 after a Russian doping disqualification, Canada briefly tied its Vancouver performance in total medal count. However, the IOC decision was overturned on appeal, bumping the Canadian team back to fourth and the total medal count back to 2nd and 3rd.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_alpine_skiing": "Alpine skiing is an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, included nordic skiing, but the first alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held for both men and women in 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were meant for amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany."
