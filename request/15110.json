After being convicted of financial crimes related to repeated incidents of child molestation, he became the highest-ranking elected official in U.S. history to have served a prison sentence. \n From 1965 to 1981, Hastert was a high school teacher and coach at Yorkville High School in Yorkville, Illinois. He lost a 1980 bid for the Illinois House of Representatives, but ran again and won a seat in 1981.  He was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1986, and was re-elected every two years until he retired in 2007. Hastert rose through the Republican ranks in the House, becoming chief deputy whip in 1995 and Speaker in 1999. As Speaker of the House, Hastert supported the George W. Bush administration's foreign and domestic policies. After Democrats took control of the House in 2007 following the 2006 elections, Hastert declined to seek the position of minority leader, resigned his House seat, and became a lobbyist at the firm of Dickstein Shapiro.\n On May 28, 2015, Hastert was indicted on federal charges of structuring bank withdrawals to evade bank reporting requirements and making false statements to federal investigators. Federal prosecutors said that the funds withdrawn by Hastert were used as hush money to conceal past sexual misconduct by Hastert. In October 2015, Hastert entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors.  Under the agreement, Hastert pleaded guilty to the structuring charge (a felony); the charge of making false statements was dropped. In court submissions filed in April 2016, federal prosecutors alleged that Hastert had molested at least four boys as young as 14 years of age during his time as a high school wrestling coach. At a sentencing hearing, Hastert admitted that he had sexually abused boys whom he had coached. Referring to Hastert as a \"serial child molester\", a federal judge imposed a sentence of 15 months in prison, two years' supervised release, and a $250,000 fine.

  "/wiki/1998_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections": "The 1998 United States House of Representatives elections were part of the midterm elections held during President Bill Clinton's second term. They were a major disappointment to the Republicans, who were expecting to gain seats due to the embarrassment Clinton suffered during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the \"six-year itch\" effect observed in most second-term midterm elections. However, the Republicans lost five seats to the Democrats, but retained a narrow majority in the House. A wave of Republican discontent with Speaker Newt Gingrich prompted him to resign shortly after the election; he was replaced by Congressman Dennis Hastert of Illinois.\n The campaign was marked by Republican attacks on the morality of President Bill Clinton, with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr having released his report on the Lewinsky scandal and House leaders having initiated an inquiry into whether impeachable offenses had occurred. However, exit polls indicated that most voters opposed impeaching Clinton, and predictions of high Republican or low Democratic turnout due to the scandal failed to materialize. Some speculate that the losses reflected a backlash against the Republicans for attacking the popular President Clinton. With the Republicans having lost 4 House seats and failing to gain any seats in the Senate, it was the first time since 1934 that the non-presidential party failed to gain congressional seats in a mid-term election. It was also the first time since 1822 that the non-presidential party had failed to gain seats in the mid-term election of a President's second term.\n Seats picked up by the Democrats included Kansas's\u00a03rd district, Nevada's\u00a01st district, Pennsylvania's\u00a013th district, New Mexico's\u00a03rd district, New Jersey's\u00a012th district, Kentucky's\u00a04th district, Mississippi's\u00a04th district, California's\u00a01st district, Wisconsin's\u00a02nd district, Washington's\u00a01st district, and Washington's\u00a03rd district. The Republicans, however, picked up seats in Kentucky's\u00a06th district, Wisconsin's\u00a08th district, California's\u00a03rd district, California's\u00a036th district, Pennsylvania's\u00a015th district, and North Carolina's\u00a08th district.",
  "/wiki/2008_Ohio's_11th_congressional_district_special_election": "Ohio's 11th congressional district special election, 2008 took place on November 18, 2008. The seat of the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 11th congressional district was vacated following the death of Democrat Stephanie Tubbs Jones on August 20, 2008. Since more than one candidate from the Democratic Party filed to take part in the election, a primary was held on October 14, 2008. The special election was won by Marcia Fudge.",

A member of the Democratic Party, she won a special election to succeed Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who died in office.  The district includes most areas of Cleveland and Akron. Fudge was Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress.",
  "/wiki/2008_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections": "The 2008 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 4, 2008, to elect members to the United States House of Representatives to serve in the 111th United States Congress from January 3, 2009, until January 3, 2011. It coincided with the election of Barack Obama as President. All 435 voting seats, as well as all 6 non-voting seats, were up for election. The Democratic Party, which won a majority of seats in the 2006 election, expanded its control in 2008. The Republican Party, hoping to regain the majority it lost in the 2006 election or at least expand its congressional membership, lost additional seats. With one exception (Louisiana's 2nd district), the only seats to switch from Democratic to Republican had been Republican-held prior to the 2006 elections. Republicans gained five Democratic seats total, while losing 26 of their own, giving the Democrats a net gain of 21 seats, effectively erasing all gains made by the GOP since 1994. In addition, with the defeat of Republican congressman Chris Shays in Connecticut's 4th district, this became the first time since the 1850s that no Republican represented the New England region. The 10.6% popular vote advantage by the Democrats was the largest by either party since 1982, 26 years earlier. Turnout increased due to the 2008 presidential election. The presidential election, 2008 Senate elections, and 2008 state gubernatorial elections, as well as many other state and local elections, occurred on the same date."
