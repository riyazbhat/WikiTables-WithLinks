It was formed in 1953 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Kern River at the junction of its two forks at Whiskey Flat. At 11,000 acres (4,500\u00a0ha), it is one of the larger reservoirs in California. The area is in the southern end of the Sierra Nevada range and the lake itself is located in low mountains at an elevation of approximately 2,500\u00a0ft (760\u00a0m) where summer temperatures reach over 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) but low enough to avoid winter snows on the surrounding ridges. Lake Isabella is located about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) northeast of Bakersfield, and is the main water supply for that city. Lake Isabella can be reached by car from Bakersfield via state Highway 178 and from Delano via Highway 155.  The former towns of Isabella and Kernville were flooded by the newly created reservoir.",
