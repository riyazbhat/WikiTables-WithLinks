The last two entries in the series are Creed and Creed 2, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis Creed, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.
