Building began about 1175 at the east end with the choir. Historian John Harvey sees it as Europe's first truly Gothic structure, breaking the last constraints of Romanesque. The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate, \"stiff-leaf\" style. Its Early English front with 300 sculpted figures, is seen as a \"supreme triumph of the combined plastic arts in England\". The east end retains much ancient stained glass.
