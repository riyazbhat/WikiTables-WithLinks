It is the southernmost, largest, and second least populated region of Chile. It comprises four provinces: \u00daltima Esperanza, Magallanes, Tierra del Fuego, and Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena. Magallanes's geographical features include Torres del Paine, Cape Horn, Tierra del Fuego island, and the Strait of Magellan. It also includes the Antarctic territory claimed by Chile. Despite its large area, much of the land in the region is rugged or closed off for sheep farming, and is unsuitable for settlement. 80% of the population lives in the capital Punta Arenas, a major market city and one of the main hubs for Antarctic exploration. The main economic activities are sheep farming, oil extraction, and tourism.",

The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.",
  "/wiki/Zambia": "Zambia (/\u02c8z\u00e6mbi\u0259/), officially the Republic of Zambia, is a landlocked country in Southern-Central Africa (although some sources consider it part of East Africa).

These were merged in 1911 to form Northern Rhodesia. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company.",
