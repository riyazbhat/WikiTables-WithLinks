He became the first Jewish graduate student in History at Cornell University and earned his M.A. in History at Cornell in 1949.\nWhile writing his dissertation under the direction of Henry Guerlac at Cornell, Marsak accepted a position as Instructor of History and the Humanities at Reed College in Portland, Oregon in 1953. While teaching at Reed College in 1954, Marsak was questioned before the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he respectfully declined to answer on the grounds of the 1st and 5th Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nWhile having some trouble finding another position, Marsak finished his Ph.D. in History at Cornell University in 1957, with a dissertation on the French philosopher Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle. He was eventually hired in 1960 by the History Department at Rice University, where he taught for some years before being hired as an Associate Professor in the History Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965, where he joined Joachim Remak and C. Warren Hollister in building a strong European history program.\nProfessor Marsak published widely on Modern European Intellectual History in books, articles, and reviews. His article \u201cCartesianism in Fontenelle and French Science, 1686-1752,\u201d (published in the journal Isis in 1959) established his reputation as a scholar of the history of science.  He followed this with Bernard de Fontenelle: The Idea of Science in the French Enlightenment in 1959 (a revision of his doctoral dissertation). Although he continued to publish scholarly articles and reviews, Marsak reached his widest audience with a series of edited works with major publishers over the next several years, including: French Philosophers: From Descartes to Sartre (New York: Meridian, 1961); The Rise of Science in Relation to Society (New York: Macmillan, 1964); The Achievement of Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle (New York: Johnson Reprint, 1970); The Enlightenment (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1972); and The Nature of Historical Inquiry (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1970).\nMarsak was a popular and reflective classroom instructor. He and his wife Ann Marsak (a scholar in her own right, as well as an environmental activist) also collected extensively in Asian Art.
