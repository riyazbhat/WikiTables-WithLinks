  "/wiki/Cross_County_Parkway": "The Cross County Parkway (CCP) is a 4.46-mile-long (7.18\u00a0km) parkway in lower Westchester County, New York, in the United States. The parkway is a critical east\u2013west connection throughout Westchester, having full interchanges with every major north\u2013south highway in southern Westchester with the exception of Interstate 95 (New England Thruway). Among its junctions, it has access to the New York State Thruway mainline. The western terminus is at the Saw Mill Parkway in Yonkers. The eastern terminus is at the Hutchinson River Parkway in New Rochelle.\n As evident from stubs and oversized overpasses, it appears that there were plans to expand the Parkway west from exit\u00a02 to Downtown Yonkers and east from exit\u00a09 to I-95. World War II had slowed this idea until it was shelved. The CCP is the only parkway in New York state that has express and local lanes.

Initially, there were only 29 routes; by the late 1920s, there were several dozen highways. In the 1930 state highway renumbering, some of these routes were reconfigured or renumbered while hundreds of other, smaller routes were assigned. Since that time, routes have been added and removed from the state highway system at various times for reasons ranging from the construction and/or removal of highways to the end result of \"maintenance swaps\", or transfers of highway maintenance from the state of New York to lower levels of government and vice versa. State-maintained portions of routes have reference markers, small, green signs that are posted approximately every one-tenth mile along the side of the roadway.\n Designations that are shaded in dark gray and without a route shield are numbers not currently assigned to a highway.
