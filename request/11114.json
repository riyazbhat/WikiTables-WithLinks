  "/wiki/Cross_County_Parkway": "The Cross County Parkway (CCP) is a 4.46-mile-long (7.18 km) parkway in lower Westchester County, New York, in the United States. The parkway is a critical east-west connection throughout Westchester, having full interchanges with every major north-south highway in southern Westchester with the exception of Interstate 95 (New England Thruway). Among its junctions, it has access to the New York State Thruway mainline. The western terminus is at the Saw Mill Parkway in Yonkers. The eastern terminus is at the Hutchinson River Parkway in New Rochelle. As evident from stubs and oversized overpasses, it appears that there were plans to expand the Parkway west from exit 2 to Downtown Yonkers and east from exit 9 to I-95. World War II had slowed this idea until it was shelved. The CCP is the only parkway in New York state that has express and local lanes. The parkway is designated New York State Route 907K (NY 907K), an unsigned reference route.",

The highway has borne the number 202 since at least 1936. Before this, sections of the highway were designated U.S. Route 122, as it intersected US 22.

The origins of NY 9A date back to the 1920s when an alternate route of then-NY 6 from Yonkers to Tarrytown was designated as NY 6A. NY 6 was redesignated as US 9 in 1927; however, NY 6A was not renumbered to NY 9A until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

The second, a 68-mile (109 km) overlap through western and central New York, is the second-longest concurrency in the state, stretching from Avon east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County. The concurrency is known locally as Routes 5 and 20. As the route proceeds across the state, it also directly or indirectly meets every major north-south highway in upstate New York, including all three north-south Interstate Highways (I-390 in Avon, I-81 in Syracuse via US 11, and I-87 in Albany). NY 5 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross-state highway, extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east, mostly by way of modern US 20. At the time, modern NY 5 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route 5A. By 1926, NY 5 was moved onto the routing of NY 5A while the old routing of NY 5 became NY 7.

It begins in the town of Hempstead at an intersection with NY 105 in North Bellmore and heads to the north, crossing the hamlets of East Meadow and Levittown before entering the town of Oyster Bay. In Hicksville, NY 106 becomes concurrent with NY 107, an overlap colloquially known as the One oh Six-One oh Seven. The concurrency ends immediately after an interchange with Jericho Turnpike in the hamlet of Jericho. After breaking away from NY 107, NY 106 heads north across the villages of Brookville and Muttontown and the hamlet of East Norwich to the hamlet of Oyster Bay, where the route ends one block south of Oyster Bay Harbor. A large portion of the route, including the concurrency with NY 107, is a multi-lane, divided highway. It runs through both the relatively dense, middle-class suburbs of southern and central Nassau County and the affluent, sparsely populated suburbs of the north shore. Along the way, it accesses the Hicksville Long Island Rail Road station and the Broadway Mall, also in Hicksville. At a point north of NY 25A, the road narrows from four to two lanes on its way to Oyster Bay. South of the route's terminus at NY 105, a junction which is also that route's western terminus, Newbridge Road continues to Bellmore as County Route 106 (CR 106), an unsigned county road.
