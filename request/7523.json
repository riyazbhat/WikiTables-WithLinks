  "/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_formats": "Magic: The Gathering formats are various ways in which the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game can be played. Each format provides rules for deck construction and gameplay, with many confining the pool of permitted cards to those released in a specified group of Magic card sets. The DCI, the governing body that oversees official Magic competitive play, categorizes its tournament formats into Constructed and Limited. \n Constructed formats require decks to be made prior to participation, with players allowed to use any tournament-legal cards they possess. Sanctioned Constructed formats include Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Vintage. Limited formats, in contrast, utilize a restricted and unknown pool of cards, usually formed by opening Magic products. Limited competition require players to select cards and build decks on the fly within the tournament itself. The primary two sanctioned Limited formats are Sealed Deck and Booster Draft. \n A number of other formats have been designed by Wizards of the Coast or by players for custom gameplay or reduced investment cost; these are known as casual formats. Some casual formats utilize rules or sets of  cards that differ from those used in sanctioned tournament play.",
  "/wiki/Calendar_date": "A calendar date is a reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system. The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified. The number of days between two dates may be calculated. For example, \"24 February 2020\" is ten days after \"14 February 2020\" in the Gregorian calendar. The date of a particular event depends on the observed time zone. For example, the air attack on Pearl Harbor that began at 7:48\u00a0a.m. Hawaiian time on 7 December 1941 took place at 3:18\u00a0a.m. Japan Standard Time, 8 December in Japan.\n A particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar, which have been used simultaneously in different places. In most calendar systems, the date consists of three parts: the day of the month, the month, and the year. There may also be additional parts, such as the day of the week. Years are usually counted from a particular starting point, usually called the epoch, with era referring to the particular period of time (note the different use of the terms in geology).\n The most widely used epoch is a conventional birthdate of Jesus (which was established by Dionysius Exiguus in the sixth century). A date without the year may also be referred to as a date or calendar date (such as \"20 February\" rather than \"20 February 2020\"). As such, it defines the day of an annual event, such as a birthday on 31 May, holiday on 1 September, or Christmas on 25 December.\n Many computer systems internally store points in time in Unix time format or some other system time format.\nThe date (Unix) command\u2014internally using the C date and time functions\u2014can be used to convert that internal representation of a point in time\nto most of the date representations shown here.\n The current date in the Gregorian calendar is 20 February 2020.

  "/wiki/Grand_Prix_(Magic:_The_Gathering)": "Grands Prix (GPs) are professional Magic: The Gathering tournaments, awarding cash prizes, Pro Points and invitations to Pro Tours. They are open to all players and are usually the biggest Magic tournaments. The first Grand Prix was held on 22\u201323 March 1997 in Amsterdam (Netherlands).

The term \"Grand Prix\" can refer to either the tournament or to the entire weekend.

  "/wiki/List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_national_champions": "The Magic: The Gathering national champions are the players who won National Championships (Nationals) that year. (with the exception of champions between 2012\u201316, which were awarded to players with the most Pro Points at the end of a Pro Tour season)\n Nationals took place around the world usually in summer or autumn. Eligibility to play in a national championship was determined on residence instead of nationality. In addition, Nationals required eligible players to qualify. (prior to 2011, countries with smaller populations of Magic players open nationals were held, meaning that any eligible player could compete in this tournament)\n After 2011 Nationals were discontinued by Wizards of the Coast when they restructured their Magic: The Gathering organized play program, abandoning national championships, and restructuring the World Championship. From 2012 to 2016 the title of National Champion was awarded to the player with the most Pro Points of any given country at the end of a Pro Tour season. At the end of 2018 Wizards of the Coast announced that in 2019 there would be no National Championships. As of April 2019 it is unclear whether Nationals are on hiatus or abandoned. The title National Champion will not be awarded in 2019.\n In 2018, National Champions were determined in 74 nations and regions. In most cases these regions line up with countries, but special exemptions were made in some cases, for example Puerto Rico and the countries of the United Kingdom.",

  "/wiki/Pro_Tour_(Magic:_The_Gathering)": "The Pro Tour (often abbreviated as PT) is the second-highest form of competitive play (after the World Championship) for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game. It consists of a series of tournaments held throughout the world, each requiring an invitation to participate. Every Pro Tour awards a total of $240,000 in cash prizes, with $50,000 going to the winner. Pro Tour competitors also receive Pro Points, the amount depending on their results. Pro Points award special benefits to players, including automatic qualification and travel awards for subsequent Pro Tours. Currently, four Pro Tours are held during a twelve-month season also known colloquially as a year. \n The Pro Tour was introduced in 1996 with the first event being held in New York. Over 100 such tournaments have been held since.\n Finishing within the Top 8 of a Pro Tour is considered to be one of the greatest accomplishments a competitive Magic player can achieve. Professional players are thus often compared by the number of Pro Tour Top 8 finishes they have made throughout their career. The most successful players on the Pro Tour are Kai Budde, who won seven Pro Tours out of ten Top 8 finishes, and Jon Finkel, who won three Pro Tours, while making it to the Top 8 sixteen times.",
  "/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_World_Championship": "The Magic: The Gathering World Championships (Worlds) have been held annually since 1994. It is the most important tournament in the game of Magic: The Gathering, offering cash prizes of up to $100,000 to the winners. With the exception of the first edition, Worlds is an invitation-only event, and from 1996 to 2011 World was the last event of each Pro Tour season. The invitees were mostly top finishers from the National championships, the top-ranked players of the DCI and high-level pro players. Since 2012 the World Championships are held after the season and the most successful 16 or 24 players have been invited to the tournament.\n After the first five World Championships were all held in the United States, Worlds have since been held in Japan, Australia and various countries in Europe. Besides the main event Worlds were always a huge gathering of Magic players, who came to watch the pros and compete in side events.\n After the 2011 season, the World Championship was briefly replaced by the Magic Players Championship. The top 16 pro players selected due to various criteria were invited to the Players Championship. In 2013 the tournament was renamed to 'World Championship' once again. From 2014 to 2018 the tournament was expanded to 24 competitors, but is going back to 16 players for the 2019 Worlds.\n The large World Championships, held until 2011, also included a national team portion where the top players from each National Championship engaged in a separate competition. The decision to abandon large World Championships would have left the community without such an event. In part due to heavy demand by the players, Wizards of the Coast decided to create a replacement after initially abandoning the national team competition. A new team competition, the World Magic Cup was held annually from 2012 to 2017.\n Twentyfive World Championships have been held since 1994. The most successful contestant is Shahar Shenhar, the only player to win Worlds twice. In the team portion the United States are by far the most successful country, having won 8 out of 23 editions.",
