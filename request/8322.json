With the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814, the King rejected any type of Popular sovereignty (Junta or Cortes). The Liberal Triennium of 1820 also did not change the position of the C\u00e1diz constitution of 1812 against separatism, while Latin Americans were increasingly radicalized seeking political independence.",
