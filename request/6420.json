She was a member of the gold-medal-winning United States women's gymnastics team (the \"Magnificent Seven\") at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n The hallmarks of Moceanu's gymnastics, in the early part of her elite career, were daring tricks on the balance beam and spunky routines on the floor exercise. Later, under the direction of new coaches, she developed a more elegant, mature style.\n Moceanu trained under Marta and B\u00e9la K\u00e1rolyi, and later Lumini\u021ba Miscenco and Mary Lee Tracy. She earned her first national team berth at age 10 and represented the United States in various international competitions at the junior level. She was the all-around silver medalist at the 1992 Junior Pan American Games and the 1994 junior national champion. In 1995, at the age of 13, she became the youngest gymnast to win the senior all-around title at the U.S. National Championships. She was the youngest member of both the 1995 World Championships team and the gold-medal-winning 1996 Olympics team, and was the last gymnast to compete legally in the Olympics at the age of 14.[citation needed]\n Moceanu's last major success in gymnastics was at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she became the first American to win the all-around gold medal. Family problems, coaching changes, and injuries derailed her efforts to make the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, and she retired from the sport in 2000. Since then, she has worked as a coach, studied business management, and written a memoir, Off Balance.",

  "/wiki/Qiao_Ya": "Qiao Ya (simplified Chinese: \u4e54\u5a05; traditional Chinese: \u55ac\u5a6d; pinyin: Qi\u00e1o Y\u00e0; born January 10, 1977) is a retired Chinese artistic gymnast. She was the 1994 Asian Games All-Around Champion, a finalist on balance beam at the 1994 and 1995 World Gymnastics Championships, and competed at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta \u2013 where she placed 11th in the individual All-Around and 4th with the team during Team Finals.\n Despite a disappointing showing at the 1994 American Cup, Qiao began her international career on a high: beating her more widely known teammate, Mo Huilan, to the individual All-Around title at the 1994 Asian Games. At these championships Qiao also placed first with her team and finished with a bronze medal on balance beam.\n At the 1994 World Championships Qiao had moderate success \u2013 finishing 10th in the individual all-around and making the balance beam final. She qualified for the beam final in 4th place and was one of the favourites to challenge America's Shannon Miller for the title but took a fall during the final on her tumbling run (a back-handspring to two layout somersaults), and ultimately finished in 7th place.\n In 1995 Qiao competed at the 1995 World Championships \u2013 where the team took second place behind 1994 World Champions Romania. The Chinese team actually scored the highest in the Team Optionals portion of the competition but their disappointing scores during the Compulsories round (where they were weak on vault and bars) prevented them from taking first place. During the team competition she did not compete on all four events and so did not qualify for the individual All-Around final. She did however qualify for the beam final (for the 2nd consecutive year) but a balance break at the beginning of the routine (a difficult round off to layout step-out mount onto the beam) resulted in an 8th-place finish.\n Qiao also competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics. After their impressive showing at the 1995 Worlds many gymnastics fans and experts expected the Chinese to challenge the United States, Romania and Russia for the team title. However the team did not compete well during both the Compulsories and Team Optional exercises and finished the competition in 4th place, just ahead of Ukraine but a long way behind America (1st), Russia (2nd) and Romania (3rd). Qiao qualified for the all-around final in 29th place and ultimately finished 11th in that competition. Having scored a 9.725 on beam, a 9.675 on floor and 9.718 on vault she looked set to finish in the Top 8 but a disappointing set on bars (traditionally her weakest piece) where she scored only a 9.600 dropped her out of the Top 10 altogether.\n Qiao retired from competitive gymnastics shortly after the 1996 Olympics and is now coaching in Singapore.",
