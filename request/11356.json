The Council and Assembly were to bear in mind that the elected panel of judges was to represent every major legal tradition in the League, along with every major civilization. Each member state was allowed to recommend 4 potential judges, with a maximum of 2 from its own nation. Judges were elected by a straight majority vote, held independently in the Council and Assembly. The judges served for a period of nine years, with their term limits all expiring at the same time, necessitating a completely new set of elections. The judges were independent and rid themselves of their nationality for the purposes of hearing cases, owing allegiance to no individual member state, although it was forbidden to have more than one judge from the same state. As a sign of their independence from national ties, judges were given full diplomatic immunity when engaged in Court business The only requirements for a judge were high moral character and that they have the qualifications required in their respective countries [for] the highest judicial offices or be jurisconsults of recognized competence in international law."
