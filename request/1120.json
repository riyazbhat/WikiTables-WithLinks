  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare (/\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r, -t\u0251\u02d0r/; SI symbol: ha) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides (1 hm2), or 10,000 m2, and is primarily used in the measurement of land. There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre. An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres.\n In 1795, when the metric system was introduced, the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare (hecto- + are) was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 (10,000 square metres). When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960, resulting in the International System of Units (SI), the are was not included as a recognised unit. The hectare, however, remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely. Though the dekare/decare daa (1,000 m2) and are a (100 m2) are not officially accepted for use, they are still used in some contexts.",

Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959, an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres. An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac.\n The acre is a statute measure in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire: in most it is lawful to 'use for trade' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration.\n In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only two parts per million: see below.

The river provides groundwater recharge, recreation, and industrial, agricultural and municipal water supply. The Eel River system is among the most dynamic in California because of the region's unstable geology and the influence of major Pacific storms. The discharge is highly variable; average flows in January and February are over 100 times greater than in August and September. The river also carries the highest suspended sediment load of any river of its size in the United States, in part due to the frequent landslides in the region.

  "/wiki/James_San_Jacinto_Mountains_Reserve": "The James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve, a unit of the University of California Natural Reserve System, is a 29-acre (120,000 m2) ecological reserve and biological field station located at an altitude of 5,200 feet (1,600 m) in a wilderness area of the San Jacinto Mountains near Lake Fulmor in Riverside County, California, United States. The James Reserve property was purchased in 1966 by the University of California, Riverside, from Harry and Grace James. In addition to acting as a protected natural area for teaching and research in the sciences, it is also available as an engineering testing ground for various sensor-related and ecosystem monitoring technologies. The primary research focus at the James Reserve has been ecological monitoring using ecological sensing systems. Over the internet, researchers, students and the interested public may unobtrusively visit and view nature via a webcam observatory, which includes an interactive robotic camera. Devices in the outdoor laboratory allow non-intrusive, around-the-clock monitoring. The Director of the Reserve is Dr. Jennifer Gee, who received her Ph.D. from Princeton University, in the field of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Overnight accommodations for researchers and school groups may be made for the on-site Trailfinders Lodge.",

Other events include the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the ANA Inspiration (Dinah Shore) women\u2019s golf tournament, and the Indian Wells Masters tennis tournament. In addition to Palm Springs and Indio, the valley is home to the resort cities of Cathedral City, Indian Wells, La Quinta, Palm Desert, and Rancho Mirage. Because it is a major winter destination, the valley's population fluctuates from almost 500,000 in April to around 200,000 in July and around 800,000 by January.",
