  "/wiki/Section_(United_States_land_surveying)": "In U.S. land surveying under the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), a section is an area nominally one square mile (2.6 square kilometers), containing 640 acres (260 hectares), with 36 sections making up one survey township on a rectangular grid.\n The legal description of a tract of land under the PLSS includes the name of the state, name of the county, township number, range number, section number, and portion of a section. Sections are customarily surveyed into smaller squares by repeated halving and quartering. A quarter section is 160 acres (65 ha) and a \"quarter-quarter section\" is 40 acres (16 ha). In 1832 the smallest area of land that could be acquired was reduced to the 40-acre (16 ha) quarter-quarter section, and this size parcel became entrenched in American mythology. After the Civil War, freedmen (freed slaves) were reckoned to be self-sufficient with \"40 acres and a mule.\" In the 20th century real estate developers preferred working with 40-acre (16 ha) parcels. The phrases \"front 40\" and \"back 40,\" referring to farm fields, indicate the front and back quarter-quarter sections of land.\n One of the reasons for creating sections of 640 acres (260 ha) was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres. A section can be halved seven times in this way, down to a 5-acre (2 ha) parcel, or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section\u2014an easily surveyed 50-square-chain (2 ha) area. This system was of great practical value on the American frontier, where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly.\n A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form, might look like \"NW 1/4, NE 1/4, Sec. 34, T.3S, R.1W, 1st P.M.\" or, alternatively, \"34-3-1 NW4NE4 1PM\". In expanded form this would read \"the Northwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 34 of Township 3 South, Range 1 West, first Principal Meridian\".",
  "/wiki/Survey_township": "Survey township, sometimes called Congressional township, as used by the United States Public Land Survey System, refers to a square unit of land that is nominally six (U.S. Survey) miles (~9.7 km) on a side. Each 36-square-mile (~93 km2) township is divided into 36 one-square-mile (~2.6 km2) sections, which can be further subdivided for sale, and each section covers a nominal 640 acres (2.6 km2). The townships are referenced by a numbering system that locates the township in relation to a principal meridian (north-south) and a base line (east-west). For example, Township 2 North, Range 4 East is the 4th township east of the principal meridian and the 2nd township north of the base line. Township (exterior) lines were originally surveyed and platted by the US General Land Office using contracted private survey crews. Later survey crews subdivided the townships into sections (interior) lines. Virtually all lands covered by this system were sold according to those boundaries and are marked on the U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps.",
  "/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System": "The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is the surveying method developed and used in the United States to plat, or divide, real property for sale and settling. Also known  as the Rectangular Survey System, it was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785 to survey land ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, following the end of the American Revolution. Beginning with the Seven Ranges, in present-day Ohio, the PLSS has been used as the primary survey method in the United States. Following the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, in 1787, the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory platted lands in the Northwest Territory. The Surveyor General was later merged with the General Land Office, which later became a part of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Today, the BLM controls the survey, sale, and settling of the new lands.",

  "/wiki/George_Deffenbaugh_Mound": "The George Deffenbaugh Mound is a Native American mound in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located northeast of Laurelville in Hocking County, the mound sits on a ridgeline; it is 6.5 feet (2.0 m) tall and approximately 50 feet (15 m) in diameter.  It was first excavated at an unknown date prior to 1941; at this time, a hole was sunk from the mound's crest to its base, and a smaller hole was dug into its edge.\n The mound's location and conical shape indicates that it is a work of the Adena culture, which was active between 1000 BC and AD 400.  Occupation of the vicinity was not seemingly limited to the Adena period; approximately 0.3 miles (0.48 km) away from the Deffenbaugh Mound is a stone mound perhaps built by the Fort Ancient culture, perhaps more than one thousand years after the construction of the Deffenbaugh Mound.\n In 1974, the Deffenbaugh Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its potential to be a valuable archaeological site.",

  "/wiki/Karshner_Mound": "The Karshner Mound is a Native American mound in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located near the village of Laurelville in Hocking County, it is one of Ohio's largest remaining burial mounds that has not been significantly damaged since white settlement.  Measuring 100 feet (30 m) in diameter and 28 feet (8.5 m) high, it lies in the middle of a farm field, but it has never been cultivated, and vegetation on the mound has prevented erosion.\n Although no archaeological investigation has ever been carried out at the Karshner Mound, it is believed to have been constructed by people of the Adena culture, who inhabited the region between 1000 BC and AD 400.  This identification is based on its shape and location; the Karshner Mound lies on the second terrace above Salt Creek, and large numbers of mounds on terraces above small streams have been found to be constructed by the Adena.  Because of this identification, the mound is seen as a valuable archaeological site and believed to be likely to yield many informative artifacts if excavated.  In recognition of its archaeological value, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.",
  "/wiki/Edith_Ross_Mound": "The Edith Ross Mound is a Native American mound and archaeological site in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located near the village of Laurelville in Hocking County, the mound is a circular structure that measures 40 feet (12 m) in diameter at its base and 4.6 feet (1.4 m) high at the center.  It is constructed primarily of earth, with large stones placed on various parts of the surface.  Few changes have been made to the mound since white settlement of the region; a small depression in the northwestern corner may be the result of someone digging, but no significant damage was done.\n The Ross Mound is important primarily for its archaeological value.  The land surrounding the mound has yielded large numbers of archaeological artifacts, and a concentration of stones on the western edge of the mound's surface suggests that a grave or wall was once located there.  The essentially pristine condition of the mound guarantees that any burials and grave goods placed in the mound at the time of its construction is still buried within.  Because no systematic excavation has been undertaken of the mound, its contents and its builders are uncertain.  Archaeologists are certain that it is a burial mound, but the date and culture are unknown: possible candidates for the builders are the Adena, Hopewell, or Fort Ancient cultures, and it could have been built as early as 1000 BC or as late as AD 1000.\n In recognition of the Edith Ross Mound's archaeological value, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973; it is one of four Hocking County archaeological sites on the Register.",
