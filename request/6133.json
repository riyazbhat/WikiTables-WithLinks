  "/wiki/Castle_Quarter": "Castle Quarter (Welsh: Cwr y Castell) is an independent retail destination area in the north of the city centre of Cardiff, Wales. Castle is also a community (parish) of Cardiff.\n The Castle Quarter includes some of Cardiff's Victorian and Edwardian arcades: Castle Arcade, High Street Arcade and Duke Street Arcade, and principal shopping streets: St Mary Street, High Street, Castle Street and Duke Street. The Castle Quarter hosts over 80 independent businesses.[citation needed]\n Development of the area by Cardiff Council began in February 2010 aiming to create the Castle Quarter, particularly High Street and St Mary Street, into a pedestrian friendly environment to enhance the city centre. In 2014 the shopping arcades and other major properties in the Castle Quarter were purchased by property firms with view to restoration and improvement.\n The recent restoration work has seen The Castle Quarter embrace its Victorian and Edwardian roots. The ethos behind this is to reintroduce people to authentic Cardiff, independent retailers in the heart of the city.",

One of the longer of Cardiff's famous Victorian arcades, it is also one of Cardiff's only two level shopping arcades, the other being Cardiff Market.\n Today[when?] Castle Arcade is home to a variety of small boutique shops including cafes, delicatessens, fair-trade and organic retailers. There are also several shops on the gallery level.\n Castle Arcade was Grade II* listed in 1975, being the \"finest of Cardiff's Victorian arcades\".

  "/wiki/Morgan_Arcade": "The Morgan Arcade is a shopping arcade in Cardiff, South Wales.\n Started in 1896, it was built to connect the main entrance of David Morgan's department store on St Mary's Street, with his other store on The Hayes. It opened in 1899 as the New Central Arcade, running east/west from the Hayes to St. Mary's Street.\n After Morgans bought the Royal Arcade, the family formed a holding company called the Cardiff Arcade Company, which owned and operated both the Royal and renamed Morgan arcades, which both ran underneath the store.\n After the agreed closure of David Morgan's, the property assets inside the various holdings companies were sold in late 2004 for \u00a325 million to property firm Helical Bar. David Morgan Limited, Deymel Investments Limited and the Cardiff Arcade Company Limited are now all in liquidation.\n Between 2007 and 2008 the whole site was refurbished by Helical Bar, with the arcades restored. The companies spent \u00a330M on restoring both the Morgan and Royal arcades, with some first-floor Venetian windows and original wooden storefronts still surviving. The Morgan Arcade is now described as the best preserved of Cardiff's arcades.",

  "/wiki/List_of_shopping_arcades_in_Cardiff": "Shopping arcades in Cardiff include indoor shopping centres and arcades in Cardiff city centre, Wales. Cardiff is known as the \"City of Arcades\", due to the highest concentration of Victorian, Edwardian and contemporary indoor shopping arcades in any British city.\n Up until the 1790s there were only 25 retail shops in Cardiff.  Most shopping at that time was made from market stalls.  The opening of the Royal Arcade in 1858, which was the first indoor arcade built in Cardiff, significantly increased the number of shops in Cardiff.\n Cardiff's Victorian arcades have been attracting new shops and customers since emerging from the economic recession. Existing retailers have expanded which demonstrates resurgence of the capital\u2019s unique shopping malls, according to the landlords, Curzon, who is responsible for the High Street, Castle, Duke Street and Wyndham arcades. The area around the arcades will be affected by pedestrianisation of High Street in late 2010, to create the \u00a32.5m Castle Quarter. This is expected to attract more shoppers and tourists to the Victorian arcades.\n The total length of Cardiff's city centre arcades is 797m (2,655 ft)."
