  "/wiki/Castle_Quarter": "Castle Quarter (Welsh: Cwr y Castell) is an independent retail destination area in the north of the city centre of Cardiff, Wales. Castle is also a community (parish) of Cardiff. The Castle Quarter includes some of Cardiff's Victorian and Edwardian arcades: Castle Arcade, High Street Arcade and Duke Street Arcade, and principal shopping streets: St Mary Street, High Street, Castle Street and Duke Street. The Castle Quarter hosts over 80 independent businesses. [citation needed]\n Development of the area by Cardiff Council began in February 2010 aiming to create the Castle Quarter, particularly High Street and St Mary Street, into a pedestrian friendly environment to enhance the city centre. In 2014 the shopping arcades and other major properties in the Castle Quarter were purchased by property firms with view to restoration and improvement. The recent restoration work has seen The Castle Quarter embrace its Victorian and Edwardian roots. The ethos behind this is to reintroduce people to authentic Cardiff, independent retailers in the heart of the city.",

  "/wiki/Morgan_Arcade": "The Morgan Arcade is a shopping arcade in Cardiff, South Wales. Started in 1896, it was built to connect the main entrance of David Morgan's department store on St Mary's Street, with his other store on The Hayes. It opened in 1899 as the New Central Arcade, running east/west from the Hayes to St. Mary's Street. After Morgans bought the Royal Arcade, the family formed a holding company called the Cardiff Arcade Company, which owned and operated both the Royal and renamed Morgan arcades, which both ran underneath the store. After the agreed closure of David Morgan's, the property assets inside the various holdings companies were sold in late 2004 for \u00a325 million to property firm Helical Bar. David Morgan Limited, Deymel Investments Limited and the Cardiff Arcade Company Limited are now all in liquidation. Between 2007 and 2008 the whole site was refurbished by Helical Bar, with the arcades restored. The companies spent \u00a330M on restoring both the Morgan and Royal arcades, with some first-floor Venetian windows and original wooden storefronts still surviving.",
  "/wiki/The_Hayes": "The Hayes (Welsh: Yr Ais) is a commercial area in the southern city centre of the Welsh capital, Cardiff. Centred on the road of that name leading south towards the east end of the city centre, the area is mostly pedestrianised and has an open-air snack bar. Historically, the area's most prestigious building is the Old Library, known as the Cardiff Free Library, Museum and Schools for Science and Art during its near-century (1882 to 1988) of use as the second incarnation of the city's central library. The latest, fourth permanent Cardiff Central Library opened in 2009 and is situated at the opposite end of the Hayes. Scenes of BBC's Doctor Who and Torchwood have often been filmed here.
