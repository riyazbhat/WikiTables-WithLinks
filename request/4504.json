The asteroid was named after Asterope (or Sterope), one of the Pleiades. It is a rare T-type asteroid and has a relatively dark surface. The spectrum of 233 Asterope bears a resemblance to Troilite, a sulfurous iron mineral found in most iron meteorites.",

It was discovered on 9 January 1992, by American astronomer David Rabinowitz (unaccredited) of UA's Spacewatch survey at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, United States. The very reddish object has an elongated shape and a rotation period of 9.98 hours. It was named after the creature Pholus from Greek mythology.",
  "/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)": "Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets. They generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets; almost all their orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years, but there is one Centaur, 514107 Ka\u02bbepaoka\u02bbawela, which may be in a stable (though retrograde) orbit.[how is this a centaur if the Trojans aren't?] Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets. They are named after the mythological centaurs that were a mixture of horse and human. Observational bias toward large objects makes determination of the total Centaur population difficult.  Estimates for the number of Centaurs in the Solar System more than 1 km in diameter range from as low as 44,000 to more than 10,000,000",

At other locations, a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies, but at the Lagrangian points the  gravitational forces of the two large bodies, the centripetal force of orbital motion, and (for certain points) the Coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies.",
