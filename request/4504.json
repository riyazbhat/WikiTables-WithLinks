The asteroid was named after Asterope (or Sterope), one of the Pleiades. It is a rare T-type asteroid and has a relatively dark surface. The spectrum of 233 Asterope bears a resemblance to Troilite, a sulfurous iron mineral found in most iron meteorites.\nPhotometric observations during 1995 show a rotation period of\n19.743 hours. Measurements made with the IRAS observatory give a diameter of 109.56 \u00b1 5.04 km and a geometric albedo of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01. By comparison, the MIPS photometer on the Spitzer Space Telescope gives a diameter of 97.54 \u00b1 10.32 km and a geometric albedo of 0.10 \u00b1 0.01.",

  "/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)": "Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets. They generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets; almost all their orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years, but there is one Centaur, 514107 Ka\u02bbepaoka\u02bbawela, which may be in a stable (though retrograde) orbit. [how is this a centaur if the Trojans aren't?] Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets. They are named after the mythological centaurs that were a mixture of horse and human. Observational bias toward large objects makes determination of the total Centaur population difficult. Estimates for the number of Centaurs in the Solar System more than 1 km in diameter range from as low as 44,000 to more than 10,000,000\n The first Centaur to be discovered, under the definition of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the one used here, was 944 Hidalgo in 1920.

It has a high average density, meaning that it is made of metal-rich rock.\n The Rosetta probe passed within 3,162 km (1,965 mi) of Lutetia in July 2010.

At other locations, a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies, but at the Lagrangian points the  gravitational forces of the two large bodies, the centripetal force of orbital motion, and (for certain points) the Coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies, for each given combination of two orbital bodies. For instance, there are five Lagrangian points L1 to L5 for the Sun\u2013Earth system, and in a similar way there are five different Lagrangian points for the Earth\u2013Moon system.

  "/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size": "This is a partial list of Solar System objects by size, arranged in descending order of mean volumetric radius, and divided into several size classes. These lists can also be sorted according to an object's mass and, for the largest objects, volume, density and surface gravity, insofar as these values are available. This list contains the Sun, the planets, dwarf planets, many of the larger small Solar System bodies (which includes the asteroids), all named natural satellites, and a number of smaller objects of historical or scientific interest, such as comets and near-Earth objects. Objects on this list are ordered by mean radius rather than mass; thus, objects on the lower portions of the table can be more massive than objects higher on the list if they have a higher density. Many trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have been discovered; in many cases their positions in this list are approximate, as there is frequently a large uncertainty in their estimated diameters. Solar System objects more massive than 1021 kilograms (one yottagram [Yg]) are known or expected to be approximately spherical. Astronomical bodies relax into rounded shapes (ellipsoids), achieving hydrostatic equilibrium, when their own gravity is sufficient to overcome the structural strength of their material. It was believed that the cutoff for round objects is somewhere between 100 km and 200 km in radius if they have a large amount of ice in their makeup; however, later studies revealed that icy satellites as large as Iapetus (1,470 kilometers in diameter) are not in hydrostatic equilibrium at this time, and a 2019 assessment suggests that many TNOs in the size range of 400-1000 kilometers may not even be fully solid bodies, much less gravitationally rounded."
