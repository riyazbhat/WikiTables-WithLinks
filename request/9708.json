[m\u0259l\u0259ja\u02d0\u026d\u0259m]) is a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mah\u00e9 district) by the Malayali people. It is one of 22 scheduled languages of India spoken by nearly 2.88% of Indians. Malayalam has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mah\u00e9) and is spoken by 37 million people worldwide. Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states; with significant number of speakers in the Nilgiris, Kanyakumari, and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu, and Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka. Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf, the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries.\n The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars. One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c.\u20097th century AD. A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of \"Proto-Dravidian\" or \"Proto-Tamil-Malayalam\" in the prehistoric era. Designated a \"Classical Language in India\" in 2013, it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century. The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 AD and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 AD. \n The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu alphabet, and later the Kolezhuttu, which derived from it.[unreliable source?] The current Malayalam script is based on the Vatteluttu script, which was extended with Grantha script letters to adopt Indo-Aryan loanwords. The oldest literary work in Malayalam, distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated from between the 9th and 11th centuries. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam Varthamanappusthakam, written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.",

The term is used by Jains to refer to the Tirthankaras, particularly Mahavira, and by Buddhists to refer to Lord Buddha in India. In many parts of India and South Asia, Bhagav\u0101n represents the abstract concept of a universal God to Hindus who are spiritual and religious but do not worship a specific deity.\n The term \"Bhagav\u0101n\" does not appear in Vedas or in the early or middle Upanishads. There is the use of the term \"Bhag\" in Mundaka Upanishad, but not for the term \"God\". The word \"Ishwar\" is not used in Vedic scripture, except Ishawasyopanishad. The oldest Sanskrit texts use the term Brahman to represent an abstract \"Supreme Soul\" and \"Absolute Reality\", while using names of deities like Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva to represent Gods and Goddesses. The term \"Ishvara\" appears in Vedas and Upanishads, where it is used to discuss spiritual concepts. The word Bhagav\u0101n is found in later Vedic shaastr[disambiguation needed], such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Puranas.\n In Bhakti school literature, the term is typically used for any deity to whom prayers are offered; for example, Rama, Ganesha, Krishna, Brahma, Shiva, or Vishnu. A particular deity is often the devotee's one and only Bhagavan. Bhagavan is male in Bhakti traditions, and the female equivalent of Bhagav\u0101n is Bhagavat\u012b. To some Hindus, the word Bhagavan is an abstract, genderless concept of God.\n In Buddhism's Pali scriptures, the term is used to denote Gautama Buddha, referring to him as Bhagav\u0101n Buddha (translated with the phrase \"Lord Buddha\" or \"The Blessed One\") and Bhagav\u0101n Shakyamuni. The term Bhagav\u0101n is also found in other Theravada, Mahayana and Tantra Buddhist texts.",
