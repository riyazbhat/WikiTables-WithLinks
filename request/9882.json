She is a  former Chinese gymnast who is coached by Liu Guicheng and He Hua in Beijing. She admires fellow Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan and Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorkina for the longevity of their involvement in the sport.\n Fan Ye is best known for her work on the balance beam. Her biggest accomplishment in gymnastics is winning the 2003 World Balance Beam Title. Fan Ye earned a 9.812 for that gold medal performance and has the distinction of having the highest scoring routine at an international elite competition in the 2001-2004 quad.\n Fan Ye qualified for the Chinese Olympic team in 2004. These games were a disappointment for her since she didn't qualify for the Individual All-Around or event finals. In the team final, she competed in uneven bars and balance beam. She had a disastrous bars routine when her feet hit the bar on her dismount causing her to fall face first. She scored an 8.537 but redeemed herself slightly on balance beam. By then, and after two falls from teammate Li Ya on beam, it was too late and China ranked 7th that evening.\n Fan also had disappointing results at the 2005 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, but that same year, she won the most prestigious competition in China, the Chinese National Games.  There she delivered a solid and beautiful beam routine with even more difficulty than the one she used to become World Champion in 2003.",

  "/wiki/Monette_Russo": "Monette Simone Russo (born 4 August 1988 in Lilydale, Victoria) is an Australian former artistic gymnast. She made history by becoming the first Australian gymnast ever to win an individual world championship medal at the 2005 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Melbourne, Australia, when she came third in the all-around competition and also was awarded the prestigious Longines Prize for Elegance. She also competed in three apparatus finals, finishing seventh on bars and fifth on beam and floor. Although more of an all-arounder than an events finalist, during her career she was one of the few women competing two vaults. She was also a part of the 2003 World Championships Team for Australia and won a bronze medal, another first for Australian gymnastics.\n Monette is an Olympian, having helped Australia to 8th place in the 2004 Olympics. An injury prevented her from competing in the all-around final.\n Injury also marred Monette's 2006 season. She competed at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and although she had to reduce her difficulty considerably because of her injury (only one double salto on floor, for example) she still assisted Australia to the team gold. Having qualified to the all-around, bars, and beam finals, three more medals looked likely. However, injury prevented Monette from competing in the all-around, and she fell off the beam, while receiving a bronze on bars behind Elyse Hopfner-Hibbs and Shavahn Church.\n Monette retired from elite gymnastics in May 2007.",
