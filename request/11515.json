  "/wiki/NY_30": "New York State Route\u00a030 (NY\u00a030) is a state highway in the central part of New York in the United States. It extends for 300.71 miles (483.95\u00a0km) from an interchange with NY\u00a017 (Future Interstate 86) in the Southern Tier to the US\u2013Canada border in the state's North Country, where it continues into Quebec as Route\u00a0138. On a regional level, the route serves to connect the Catskill Park to the Adirondack Park. In the latter, NY\u00a030 is known as the Adirondack Trail. Aside from the state parks, the route serves the city of Amsterdam (where it meets the New York State Thruway) and several villages.\n NY\u00a030 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of its modern routing south of Wells, replacing a series of designations that had been assigned to the highway in the 1920s. The portion of what is now NY\u00a030 north of Speculator was initially part of NY\u00a010. When that route was truncated to Arietta c.\u20091960, NY\u00a030 was extended northward over NY\u00a010's former alignment by way of an overlap with NY\u00a08.",

  "/wiki/NY_5S": "New York State Route\u00a05S (NY\u00a05S) is an east\u2013west state highway located in the Mohawk Valley of New York in the United States. It extends for 72.92 miles (117.35\u00a0km) from an interchange with NY\u00a05, NY\u00a05A, NY\u00a08, and NY\u00a012 in Utica to a smaller interchange with NY\u00a0890 in Rotterdam. The route runs along the south side of the Mohawk River for its entire length and parallels NY\u00a05, which runs along the north side of the Mohawk River (hence the \"S\" in the route number of NY\u00a05S). In some locations, NY\u00a05S has been upgraded into a super two or an expressway, mostly in Utica and western Herkimer County. The route is part of New York State Bicycle Route\u00a05 west of its junction with NY\u00a0103 in Schenectady County.\n When NY\u00a05S was assigned in 1930, the route stretched from Oneida in the west to Schenectady in the east. It was later truncated on both ends to eliminate overlaps with other state routes and to accommodate the construction of other roadways, most notably Interstate\u00a0890 (I-890) in western Schenectady.",
