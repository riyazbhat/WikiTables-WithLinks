Maryland was a founding member of the Southern Conference in 1921, a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1952, and is now a member of the Big Ten Conference.\n The nickname was coined in 1932 by Harry C. \"Curley\" Byrd, then the school's football coach and later the school's president. Previously, Maryland teams were known as the \"Old Liners\"\u2014a reference to the state's nickname, \"The Old Line State.\" However, the school newspaper, The Diamondback, wanted a better nickname.

The school mascot is an anthropomorphic turtle named \"Testudo.\" The official team colors are red, white, black, and gold, derived from the Maryland state flag.
