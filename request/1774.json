The motte is to the north of St John's Church, and the church stands on the site of an infilled bailey ditch. The origin and dates of construction of the castle are uncertain. It is thought initially to have been an earth-and-timber construction, possibly built by Robert de Alford in the mid-12th century, in the time of Henry II, though archaeological evidence of the date is lacking and it may have been significantly earlier. The earliest written records establish that it was in the possession of Richard de Alford in the early 13th century, and after his death in 1213, of the family of John de Aderne who likely married de Alford's daughter Margaret. Archaeological findings show that it was rebuilt in stone as a shell keep castle in the 13th century. Some fragments of the stonework around the bailey and significant earthworks survive. It overlooked a ford across the River Dee.",

In 1237, Henry III took over the ownership of Beeston, and it was kept in good repair until the 16th century, when it was considered to be of no further military use, although it was pressed into service again in 1643, during the English Civil War. The castle was slighted (partly demolished) in 1646, in accordance with Cromwell's destruction order, to prevent its further use as a bastion. During the 18th century, parts of the site were used as a quarry.\n The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument owned and managed by English Heritage. The walls of the outer bailey and the gatehouse and curtain walls of the inner bailey are recorded separately in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade I listed buildings.

Following his initial victories over royal forces, he became de facto ruler of the country, and played a major role in the constitutional development of England.\n During his rule, Montfort called two famous parliaments. The first stripped the King of unlimited authority, while the second included ordinary citizens from the towns. For this reason, Montfort is regarded today as one of the progenitors of modern parliamentary democracy. As Earl of Leicester he expelled Jews from that city; as he became ruler of England he also cancelled debts owed to Jews through violent seizures of records.

  "/wiki/Owen_Glendower": "Owain ab Gruffydd, lord of Glyndyfrdwy (c. 1359 \u2013 c. 1415), or simply Owain Glynd\u0175r or Glyn D\u0175r (pronounced [\u02c8o\u028aain \u0261l\u0268\u031en\u02c8du\u02d0r], anglicized to Owen Glendower), was a Welsh leader who instigated a fierce and long-running yet ultimately unsuccessful war of independence with the aim of ending English rule in Wales during the Late Middle Ages. He was the last native Welshman to hold the title Prince of Wales (Welsh: Tywysog Cymru). Glynd\u0175r was a descendant of the Princes of Powys through his father Gruffudd Fychan II, hereditary Tywysog of Powys Fadog and Lord of Glyndyfrdwy, and of those of Deheubarth through his mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn ab Owen. On 16 September 1400, Glynd\u0175r instigated the Welsh Revolt against the rule of Henry IV of England. The uprising was initially very successful and rapidly gained control of large areas of Wales, but it suffered from key weaknesses \u2013 particularly a lack of artillery, which made capturing defended fortresses difficult, and of ships, which made rebel-controlled coastlands vulnerable. The uprising was eventually suppressed by the superior resources of the English. Glynd\u0175r was driven from his last remaining strongholds in 1409, but he avoided capture; the last documented sighting of him was in 1412. He twice ignored offers of a pardon from his military nemesis, the new king Henry V of England, and despite the large rewards offered, Glynd\u0175r was never betrayed to the English.",

  "/wiki/Escarpment": "An escarpment is a steep slope or long cliff that forms as a result of faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas having different elevations. Usually scarp and scarp face are used interchangeably with escarpment.\n Some sources differentiate the two terms, however, where escarpment refers to the margin between two landforms (while scarp remains synonymous with a cliff or steep slope). In this usage an escarpment is a ridge which has a gentle slope on one side and a steep scarp on the other side.\n More loosely, the term scarp also describes a zone between a coastal lowland and a continental plateau which shows a marked, abrupt change in elevation[citation needed] caused by coastal erosion at the base of the plateau.",
  "/wiki/Edward_III_of_England": "Edward III (13 November 1312 \u2013 21 June 1377) was king of England and Lord of Ireland from January 1327 until his death. He was the seventh king of the House of Plantagenet. He is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, Edward II. Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second-longest in medieval England (after that of his great-grandfather Henry III) and saw vital developments in legislation and government, in particular the evolution of the English Parliament, as well as the ravages of the Black Death. Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup d'\u00e9tat against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337.",

  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War (1642\u20131651) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians (Roundheads) and Royalists (Cavaliers) principally over the manner of England's governance. The first (1642\u20131646) and second (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.\n The outcome of the war was threefold: the trial and execution of Charles I (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of English monarchy with, at first, the Commonwealth of England (1649\u20131653) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell (1653\u20131658) and briefly his son Richard (1658\u20131659). A king had never been executed before. In England, the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended, while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688.",
  "/wiki/List_of_castles_in_Cheshire": "There are 20 castles in the county of Cheshire in North West England. Cheshire is one of the historic counties of England and its historic boundaries are different from the modern county lines. Some castles that were formerly in Cheshire are now in Greater Manchester. In addition, Warrington Castle is historically a part of Lancashire but is within the current boundaries of Cheshire. Before the Norman conquest of England began in 1066, defensive sites in England were communal, such as Anglo-Saxon burhs built as a defence against the Danes. Castles were popularised in England by the Normans \u2013 although a few sites in the south-east pre-dating the Norman conquest \u2013 and were owned by the feudal lords. The primary purpose of a castle was military: to be used as a base of operations and to control the surrounding areas. A castle was considered to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area, and a status symbol."
