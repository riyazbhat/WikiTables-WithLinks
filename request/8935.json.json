  "/wiki/Rapper": "Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed in time to musical accompaniment. Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music, it is commonly associated with that genre in particular; however, the origins of rap precede hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which \"oral historians\", or \"praise-singers\", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their rhetorical techniques for gossip or to \"praise or critique individuals.\" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of black verbal reverence[definition needed], through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's verbal taunts and the poems of The Last Poets.[vague] Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the \"Black rhetorical continuum\", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through \"creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies\". The person credited with originating the style of \"delivering rhymes over extensive music\", that would become known as rap, was Anthony \"DJ Hollywood\" Holloway from Harlem, New York.",
