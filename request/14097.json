On June 25, 1966, President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the Department of Public Works to undertake the construction of a number of road projects to be financed through World War II reparations, including the construction of interchanges on vital intersections along EDSA.  This order would later lead to the construction of this interchange, replacing a previous roundabout between EDSA, Bonifacio Avenue and the Quirino Highway, and the Magallanes Interchange between EDSA and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx), which opened in 1975.  A shrine to Andres Bonifacio would later be constructed inside the interchange, which underwent a \u20b113 million renovation in 2009.\n Flooding in the area around the Balintawak Interchange is a problem, with the interchange being named in 2014 as one of the twenty-two most flood-prone roadways in Metro Manila.  In 2015, the Manila North Tollways Corporation, the concessionaire of the NLEx, spent close to \u20b170 million to improve the interchange's drainage systems in order to mitigate flooding.

It is the most densely populated city proper in the world as of 2018. It was the first chartered city by virtue of the Philippine Commission Act 183 on July 31, 1901 and gained autonomy with the passage of Republic Act No. 409 or the \"Revised Charter of the City of Manila\" on June 18, 1949. Manila, alongside Mexico City and Madrid are considered the world's original set of Global Cities due to Manila's commercial networks being the first to traverse the Pacific Ocean, thus connecting Asia with the Spanish Americas, marking the first time in world history when an uninterrupted chain of trade routes circled the planet. Manila is also the second most natural disaster-afflicted capital city in the world next to Tokyo, yet it is simultaneously among the most populous and fastest growing cities in Southeast Asia.\n The Spanish city of Manila was founded on June 24, 1571, by Spanish conquistador Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi. The date is regarded as the city's official founding date; however, a settlement has already existed dating back as far as 1258. Manila was also the seat of power for most of the country's colonial rulers. It is home to many historic sites, some of which were built during the 16th century. Manila has many of the Philippines' firsts, including the first university (1590), light station (1642), lighthouse tower (1846), water system (1878), hotel (1889), electricity (1895), oceanarium (1913), stock exchange (1927), flyover (1930s), zoo (1959), pedestrian underpass (1960), science high school (1963), city-run university (1965), city-run hospital (1969), and rapid transit system (1984; also considered as the first rapid transit system in Southeast Asia).\n The term \"Manila\" is commonly used to refer to the whole metropolitan area, the greater metropolitan area or the city proper.  The officially defined metropolitan area called Metro Manila, the capital region of the Philippines, includes the much larger Quezon City and the Makati Central Business District. It is the most populous region of the country, one of the most populous urban areas in the world, and is one of the wealthiest regions in Southeast Asia. The city proper is home to 1,780,148 people in 2015, and is the historic core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its administrative limits. With 71,263 people per square kilometer, Manila is also the most densely populated city proper in the world.\n The city is located on the eastern shores of Manila Bay. The Pasig River flows through the middle of the city, dividing it into the north and south sections.
