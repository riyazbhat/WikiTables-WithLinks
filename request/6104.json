  "/wiki/Milton_Keynes": "Milton Keynes (/ki\u02d0nz/ (listen) KEENZ, locally abbreviated to MK) is a large town[b] in (ceremonial) Buckinghamshire, England, about 50 miles (80 km) north-west of London. It is the principal settlement of the Borough of Milton Keynes, a unitary authority. At the 2011 Census, its population was almost 230,000; the Office for National Statistics estimates that it will reach 300,000 by 2025. The River Great Ouse forms its northern boundary; a tributary, the River Ouzel, meanders through its linear parks and balancing lakes. Approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two SSIs. In the 1960s, the UK Government decided that a further generation of new towns in the South East of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London. The New Town (in planning documents, \"New City\") of Milton Keynes was to be the biggest yet, with a target population of 250,000, in a \"designated area\" of about 22,000 acres (9,000 ha). At designation, its area incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley, Wolverton, and Stony Stratford, along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between.",

Sometimes they consist of national sub-divisions which are distinguished from others in the same country by having no lower level of administration.",
