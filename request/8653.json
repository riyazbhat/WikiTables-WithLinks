In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer.

  "/wiki/Run_of_river": "Run-of-river hydroelectricity (ROR) or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided. Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage, in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage. A plant without pondage is subject to seasonal river flows, thus the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source. Conventional hydro uses reservoirs, which regulate water for flood control and dispatchable electrical power.",
  "/wiki/Congo_River": "The Congo River, formerly known as the Zaire River under the Mobutu regime, is the second longest river in Africa, shorter  only than the Nile, as well as the second largest river in the world by discharge volume, following only the Amazon. It is also the world's deepest recorded river, with measured depths in excess of 220\u00a0m (720\u00a0ft).\nThe Congo-Lualaba-Chambeshi River system has an overall length of 4,700\u00a0km (2,920\u00a0mi), which makes it the world's ninth-longest river. The Chambeshi is a tributary of the Lualaba River, and Lualaba is the name of the Congo River upstream of Boyoma Falls, extending for 1,800\u00a0km (1,120\u00a0mi).",

The Lualaba is 1,800 kilometres (1,100\u00a0mi) long. Its headwaters are in the country's far southeastern corner near Musofi and Lubumbashi in Katanga Province, next to Zambia. The Chambeshi River is the longest river source (headstream) of the Congo.",

  "/wiki/Ruzizi_River": "The Ruzizi (also sometimes spelled Rusizi) is a river, 117 kilometres (73\u00a0mi) long, that flows from Lake Kivu to Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa, descending from about 1,500 metres (4,900\u00a0ft) to about 770 metres (2,530\u00a0ft) above sea level over its length. The steepest gradients occur over the first 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi), where hydroelectric dams have been built. Further downstream, the Ruzizi Plain, the floor of the Western Rift Valley, has only gentle hills, and the river flows into Lake Tanganyika through a delta, with one or two small channels splitting off from the main channel.",
