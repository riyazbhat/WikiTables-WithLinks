It contains the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Geologically, the Albuquerque Basin is a half-graben that slopes down towards the east to terminate on the Sandia and Manzano mountains. It has a semi-arid climate, with large areas that count as desert. From Paleo-Indian traces dating back 12,000 years, the climate used to be wetter and more fertile than it is today. The Rio Grande flows through the basin from north to south. Its valley has been irrigated for at least 1,000 years. Intense irrigation began in the late nineteenth century with new dams, levees and ditches and has caused environmental problems.",

The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd (mei\u014dn, \"less\") and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (kainos, \"new\") and means \"less recent\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene. As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene, the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages. The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch. The apes first evolved, arose, and diversified during the early Miocene (Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages), becoming widespread in the Old World. By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one, the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage (7.5\u20135.3 Ma) of the Miocene. As in the Oligocene before it, grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent.",

It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.\n As with other older geologic periods, the geological strata that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene. The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations.",

It extends northwards into the Manchester area and south into Shropshire.

These faults divide the basin from the older Carboniferous rocks of the Peak District and the North Staffordshire Coalfield. In terms of its architecture, the basin is sometimes considered to be divided into two sub-basins: the more southerly Wem\u2013Audlem Sub-basin and the Sandbach\u2013Knutsford Sub-basin to its northeast. The basin fill is mainly Permian and Triassic sandstones and mudstones, but it also incorporates economically important halite beds.

The Cambrian witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in Earth's history, known as the Cambrian explosion, in which most modern phyla first appeared. Arthropods, molluscs, fish, amphibians, synapsids and diapsids all evolved during the Paleozoic.

The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the region of Perm in Russia. The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early amniotes into the ancestral groups of the mammals, turtles, lepidosaurs, and archosaurs. The world at the time was dominated by two continents known as Pangaea and Siberia, surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa. The Carboniferous rainforest collapse left behind vast regions of desert within the continental interior. Amniotes, which could better cope with these drier conditions, rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors.

The Triassic period is subdivided into three epochs: Early Triassic, Middle Triassic and Late Triassic. Triassic began in the wake of the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, which left the Earth's biosphere impoverished; it was well into the middle of the Triassic before life recovered  its former diversity. Therapsids and archosaurs were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time. A specialized subgroup of archosaurs, called dinosaurs, first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic Period.

It is named after Widmerpool, near Nottingham and was an extension eastwards as far as Lincolnshire, of the North Staffordshire Gulf. It was formed during a rifting event, which began in the Late Devonian, that affected the area between the London-Brabant Massif to the south and the Highland Boundary Fault to the north.  It has a large normal fault on its southern margin and has the form of a half-graben.\n In time, the equatorial swamp forests on its shores were converted into the coalfields of Leicestershire, to the south and Nottinghamshire, to the north.",
  "/wiki/Carboniferous": "The Carboniferous (/\u02cck\u0251\u02d0r.b\u0259\u02c8n\u026af.\u0259r.\u0259s/ KAHR-b\u0259-NIF-\u0259r-\u0259s) is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period 358.9 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, 298.9 Mya. The name Carboniferous means \"coal-bearing\" and derives from the Latin words carb\u014d (\"coal\") and fer\u014d (\"I bear, I carry\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. Terrestrial animal life was well established by the Carboniferous period. Amphibians were the dominant land vertebrates, of which one branch would eventually evolve into amniotes, the first solely terrestrial vertebrates. Arthropods were also very common, and many (such as Meganeura) were much larger than those of today. Vast swaths of forest covered the land, which would eventually be laid down and become the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous stratigraphy evident today.",
  "/wiki/Half-graben": "A half-graben is a geological structure bounded by a fault along one side of its boundaries, unlike a full graben where a depressed block of land is bordered by parallel faults."
