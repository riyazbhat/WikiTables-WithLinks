  "/wiki/Key_(company)": "Key is a Japanese visual novel studio which formed on July 21, 1998 as a brand under the publisher Visual Arts and is located in Kita, Osaka. Key's debut visual novel Kanon (1999) combined an elaborate storyline, up-to-date anime-style art, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key's second game Air (2000) had a similar if not more complex storyline to Kanon and a more thorough gameplay. Both Kanon and Air were originally produced as adult games, but Key broke this trend with their third title Clannad (2004) released for all ages. Key has worked in the past with Interchannel and Prototype for the consumer port releases of the brand's games. Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats!
