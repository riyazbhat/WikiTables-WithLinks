Eleven unincorporated towns governed by the Clark County government are part of the Las Vegas Township and constitute the largest community in the state of Nevada.\n The names Las Vegas and Vegas are interchangeably used to indicate the Valley, the Strip, and the city, and as a brand by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to denominate the region. The Valley is affectionately known as the \"ninth island\" by Hawaii natives and Las Vegans alike, in part due to the large number of people originally from Hawaii who live in and regularly travel to Las Vegas.\n Since the 1990s the Las Vegas Valley has seen rapid growth, tripling its population of 741,459 in 1990 to 2,227,053 estimated in 2018. The Las Vegas Valley remains one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States, and in its relatively short history has established a diverse presence in international business, commerce, urban development and entertainment, as well as one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. In 2014, a record breaking 41 million visited the Las Vegas area, producing a gross metropolitan product of more than $100 billion.",
  "/wiki/Jabbawockeez": "The Jabbawockeez (stylized as JabbaWockeeZ) are an American hip-hop dance crew, best known for being the winners of the first season of America's Best Dance Crew in 2008. Established in 2003 in San Diego, California when dancers Kevin \u201cKB\u201d Brewer and Joe Larot put together an innovative dance crew to participate in dance competitions with the idea of disrupting the existing dance scene. At the time, they felt that dance crews were clones of one another, and were dancing to the \u201ctop\u201d of the music instead of digging deep into the music, and they set out to do something different. With Jabbawockeez, they showcased freestyle dance and were able to strike a balance between dancing to the music and dancing as an artistic expression. By 2004, their members included Phil \"Swagger Boy\" Tayag, Ben \"B-Tek\" Chung, Chris \"Cristyle\" Gatdula, Rynan \"Kid Rainen\" Paguio, and Jeff \"Phi\" Nguyen. Tony \"Transformer\" Tran joined the crew in 2013. The Jabbawockeez do not have a group leader; choreography for their performances, as well as music and design choices, is made as a collective unit.",
