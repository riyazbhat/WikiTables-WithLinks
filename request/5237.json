  "/wiki/Indian_National_Congress": "The Indian National Congress (pronunciation\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) (INC, often called the Congress Party or simply Congress) is a political party in India with widespread roots. Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa.[a] From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. Congress led India to independence from Great Britain,[b][c] and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.[d]\n Congress is a \"big tent\" party whose liberal social democratic platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics. Congress' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya\u2013the lifting up of all sections of society\u2013which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people. On social and economic issues, it advocates liberty, social justice, equality, welfare state, along with progressive and secular society. The party's constitution adheres to liberal\u2013democratic socialist philosophy.   \n After India's independence in 1947, Congress formed the central government of India, and many regional state governments. Congress became India's dominant political party; as of 2019, in the 17 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on seven occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further three times, heading the central government for more than 54 years. There have been six Congress Prime Ministers, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947\u20131964), and the most recent Manmohan Singh (2004\u20132014). Although it did not fare well in the last two general elections in India in 2014 and 2019, it remains one of two major, nationwide, political parties in India, along with the right-wing, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).[e] In the 2014 general election, Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance, winning only 44 seats of the 543-member Lok Sabha.\n From 2004 to 2014, United Progressive Alliance, a coalition of Congress with several regional parties, formed the Indian government led by Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister as the head of the coalition government. The leader of the party during the period, Sonia Gandhi has served the longest term as the president of the party. As of July\u00a02019[update], the party is in power in six legislative assemblies: Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra (as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi), and the union territory of Puducherry (in an alliance with DMK).",
