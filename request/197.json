  "/wiki/Swing_(dance)": "Swing dance  is a group of dances that developed with the swing style of jazz music in the 1920s\u20131940s, with the origins of each dance predating the popular swing era. During the swing era, there were hundreds of styles of swing dancing, but those that have survived beyond that era include: Lindy Hop, Balboa, Collegiate Shag, and Charleston. Today, the most well-known of these dances is the Lindy Hop,  which originated in Harlem in the early 1930s. While the majority of swing dances began in African American communities as vernacular African American dances, some influenced swing-era dances, like Balboa, developed outside of these communities. Swing dance was not commonly used to identify a group of dances until the latter half of the 20th century. Historically, the term Swing referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. Jitterbug is any form of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called East Coast Swing. It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a swing dancer).",

  "/wiki/Viennese_Waltz": "Viennese waltz (German: Wiener Walzer) is a genre of ballroom dance. At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the waltz, including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz. What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or waltz position. The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar  (the international standard of 30 measures per minute), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words Walzer (German), vals (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and valse (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz. The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation.",

It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York (Nuyoricans) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Cali Colombia, L.A. and New York styles. Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially when part of an outdoor festival. In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping, the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. Weight shifts cause the hips to move.",

  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha (sometimes called cha-cha), is a dance of Cuban origin. It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance. In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated."
