The park was named after a no-longer-extant Buddhist temple called Suizen-ji, and now hosts the Izumi Shrine, where members of the Hosokawa family are enshrined, and a N\u014dgaku-d\u014d, a Noh theater. Lord Hosokawa selected this site because of its spring-fed pond, which clean water was excellent for tea. \nThe thatched Kokin-Denju-no-Ma teahouse was originally in Kyoto's Imperial Palace, but was moved here in 1912."
