  "/wiki/St._Peter's_Catholic_Church_(Charlotte,_North_Carolina)": "St. Peter's Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church at 507 South Tryon Street in Charlotte, North Carolina. Established in 1851, it is the oldest Catholic church in Charlotte, and until 1940 was the only Catholic church in the city. St. Peter's was originally at the extreme southern limits of the city, but today it stands in the heart of uptown, across from major art museums and next to The Green. It is most likely the oldest surviving edifice on Tryon Street. The original structure stood from 1851 until 1892. The building was damaged during the civil war and in 1892 was deemed structurally unsafe. The present structure, in a simplified Victorian Gothic style rendered in dark brick, dates from 1893. As the city grew and new parishes were established in the suburbs, St. Peter's lost so many members that it ceased being a formal parish in 1970, and did not regain full parish status until 1986. Since that time, in cooperation with other churches in Charlotte, particularly their sister church, St. Peters Episcopal, they have been working to help the poor and unfortunate of Charlotte through low-cost housing, help for AIDS victims, and outreach to the homeless. Since 1986, St. Peter's has been staffed by the Jesuits. A prominent feature of the church interior was a triptych by American painter Ben Long, a three-part fresco depicting Christs Agony in the Garden, Resurrection, and Pentecost. The fresco was severely damaged in February 2002 and cannot be fully restored.",

Like Steele Creek, Mountain Island was once largely its own township but nowadays has largely either been annexed or closely integrated to Charlotte. Mountain Island is named for a small island in Mountain Island Lake, on the border of Gaston and Mecklenburg counties. Located on the extreme southwestern end of the lake, the island is mainly used as an anchor point for recreation, picnicking, and camping. A cotton mill, said by some authorities to be the first in Gaston County, was established on Mountain Island in 1848 by Thomas R. Tate and Henry Humphreys, owners of the Mount Hecla steam-powered mill near Greensboro, North Carolina. They hoped to take advantage of the less expensive water power from the Catawba River. The site at rivers edge featured a partially completed canal around the shoals that could be used for a mill race, and a steep island whose top now rises from the lake. Machinery was moved from the Mount Hecla mill by mule-drawn wagon and operations began in 1849. A village of brick houses grew around the mill. The mill and village were destroyed on July 15, 1916 in a flood caused by a hurricane.",
