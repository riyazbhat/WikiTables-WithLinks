  "/wiki/Gary_Glitter": "Paul Francis Gadd (born 8 May 1944), known professionally as Gary Glitter, is an English glam rock singer who achieved success in the 1970s and 1980s, known for his extreme glam image of glitter suits, make-up and platform boots, and his energetic live performances. He sold over 20 million records, had 26 hit singles which spent a total of 180 weeks in the UK Singles Chart; twelve reaching the Top 10, with three charting at number-one. He is listed in the Top 100 UK most successful chart acts. He was imprisoned for downloading child pornography in 1999, and child sexual abuse and attempted rape in 2006 and 2015. Formerly one of the best-loved entertainers in British music history, in 2015 Glitter was described by Alexis Petridis of The Guardian as a \"public hate figure\".\n After performing under the name Paul Raven in the 1960s, he changed his stage name to Gary Glitter in the glam rock era of the early 1970s, with a sustained solo UK chart run of hits including \"Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2\", \"Do You Wanna Touch Me\", \"I Love You Love Me Love\", \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\", and \"Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again\". Glitter's popularity waned in the late 1970s, followed by a successful comeback as a solo artist again from the 1980s. His 1984 song \"Another Rock and Roll Christmas\" is one of the most played Christmas hits of all time. In 1998, his recording of \"Rock and Roll\" was listed as one of the top 1,001 songs in music history. Glitter also released seven studio albums, and at least fifteen compilation or live albums.\n The BBC described Glitter's fall from grace as \"dramatic\" and \"spectacular\". The late 1990s saw his image become irreparably tarnished, following his 1997 arrest and 1999 conviction in the United Kingdom for downloading thousands of items of child pornography. He was also charged at the same time, but acquitted, of sexual activity with an underage girl in the 1970s. Later, Glitter faced criminal charges and deportation from several countries in connection with actual and suspected child sexual abuse. He was deported from Cambodia on suspected child sexual abuse charges in 2002. After settling in Vietnam, a Vietnamese court found him guilty of obscene acts with minors in 2006. After serving his sentence, Glitter was deported back to the UK where he was placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life. In October 2012, he was arrested again as part of Operation Yewtree. He was bailed but was eventually charged, in June 2014, with historical child sex offences. On 5 February 2015, he was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one of having sex with a girl under the age of 13 between 1975 and 1980. On 27 February 2015, he was sentenced to a total of 16 years in prison.",

  "/wiki/Queen_(band)": "Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.\n Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.\n The band's 1977 album News of the World contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"Another One Bites the Dust\" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia - a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the \"Queen +\" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.\n Estimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Phonographic Industry. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles, and all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003.

In 2018, they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",
  "/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre.\n Upon its release as a single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became a commercial success, topping the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976. It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released following Mercury's death, eventually becoming the UK's third-best-selling single of all time. It is also the only song to be the UK Christmas number one twice by the same artist. It topped the charts in several other markets as well, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and The Netherlands, later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time selling over six million copies worldwide. In the United States, the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976, but returned to the chart in 1992 after being used in the film Wayne's World and reached a new peak of number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The release of the film of the same name in 2018 resulted in renewed popularity and chart success worldwide for the song.\n Although critical reaction was initially mixed, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became Queen's most popular song and is considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time. The single was accompanied by a promotional video, which scholars consider ground-breaking. Rolling Stone stated that its influence \"cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.\" The Guardian ranked the music video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" number 31 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history, adding it ensured \"videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music\".\n In 2004, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Appearing in various polls as being one of the greatest songs in popular music, in 2012, the song topped the list on an ITV nationwide poll in the UK to find \"The Nation's Favourite Number One\" over 60 years of music, while Mercury's vocal performance was chosen as the greatest in rock history by readers of Rolling Stone. In December 2018, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became the most-streamed song from the 20th century, and the most-streamed of all classic rock songs.

Wings were noted for frequent personnel changes along with their commercial successes, going through three lead guitarists and four drummers. However, the core trio of the McCartneys and Laine remained intact throughout the group's existence.\n Created following the McCartneys' 1971 album Ram, the band's first two albums, Wild Life (1971) and Red Rose Speedway (1973) (the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough), were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul's work with the Beatles. After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die, McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band. The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973's Band on the Run, a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in \"Jet\" and the title track. Following that album, the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English. With the new line-up, Wings released 1975's Venus and Mars, which included the US number one single \"Listen to What the Man Said\", and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975\u201376. Intended as more of a group effort, Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles \"Silly Love Songs\" and \"Let 'Em In\".\n In 1977, the band earned their only UK number one single, with \"Mull of Kintyre\", which became the then-best-selling UK single in history. Wings experienced another line-up shuffle, however, with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group's 1978 album London Town. The McCartneys and Laine again added new members, recruiting guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley. The resulting album, Back to the Egg, was a relative flop, with its singles under-performing and the critical reception negative. During the supporting tour, Paul was arrested in Japan for cannabis possession, putting the band on hold. Despite a final US number one with a live-recorded version of \"Coming Up\" (1979), after Laine departed from the band, Wings discontinued for good in 1981.",

  "/wiki/Slade": "Slade were an English rock band from Wolverhampton. They rose to prominence during the glam rock era in the early 1970s, achieving 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones on the UK Singles Chart. The British Hit Singles & Albums names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three singles enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies. According to the 1999 BBC documentary It's Slade, the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.\n Following an unsuccessful move to the United States in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but the band re-formed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have shortened the group name back to Slade.\n A number of diverse artists have cited Slade as an influence, including alternative rock icons Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins, punk pioneers Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Undertones, The Runaways and The Clash, glam metal bands Kiss, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Poison, Def Leppard, heavy metal bands Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot and pop-rock stalwarts The Replacements, Cheap Trick and Oasis.\n The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense and the deliberate misspelling of their song titles (such as \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\") for which they became well known.\n In 2020 the two remaining founders of the band split up and are now performing under the names \"Dave Hill's Slade\" and \"Don Powell's Slade\" effectively meaning Slade as an official entity no longer exists.",

  "/wiki/The_New_Seekers": "The New Seekers are an English pop group, formed in London in 1969 by Keith Potger after the break-up of his group, The Seekers. The idea was that the New Seekers would appeal to the same market as the original Seekers, but their music would have pop as well as folk influences. They achieved worldwide success in the early 1970s with hits including \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\", \"You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\" and \"Beg, Steal or Borrow\".",

The song became a hit record in the US and the UK.",
  "/wiki/ABBA": "ABBA  is a Swedish pop supergroup formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest. They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition.\n During the band's main active years, it was composed of two married couples: F\u00e4ltskog and Ulvaeus, and Lyngstad and Andersson. With the increase of their popularity, their personal lives suffered which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages. The relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with latter compositions featuring darker and more introspective lyrics. After ABBA disbanded, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage, while Lyngstad and F\u00e4ltskog pursued solo careers. Ten years after their disbanding, a compilation, ABBA Gold was released, which became a worldwide bestseller. \n In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide. A film of the same name, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year. A sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was released in 2018. That same year it was announced that the band had recorded two new songs after 35 years of being inactive. \n Estimates of ABBA's total record sales are over 380 million, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. ABBA were the first group from a non-English-speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. They have a joint eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America, and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish. ABBA were honoured at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, when their hit \"Waterloo\" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2015, their song \"Dancing Queen\" was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame.",
  "/wiki/Dancing_Queen": "\"Dancing Queen\" is a Europop song by the Swedish group ABBA, and the lead single from their fourth studio album, Arrival.  It was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson. Andersson and Ulvaeus also produced the song. \"Dancing Queen\" was released as a single in Sweden on 15 August 1976, followed by a UK release and the rest of Europe a few days later. It was a worldwide hit. It became ABBA's only number one hit in the United States, and topped the charts in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany and Zimbabwe. \"Dancing Queen\" also reached the top five in many other countries.\n Musically, \"Dancing Queen\" is a Europop version of American disco music. As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating Phil Spector's Wall of Sound arrangements. The song alternates between \"languid yet seductive verses\" and a \"dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes.\" It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog's layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, \"[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly.\" Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discothe\u00e8que, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself. The music video on YouTube has over 397 million views as of January 2020, and has become ABBA's most recognisable and popular song.\n In 2015, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
  "/wiki/Julie_Covington": "Julie Covington (born 11 September 1946, London) is an English singer and actress, best known for recording the original version of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\".",
  "/wiki/Don't_Cry_for_Me_Argentina": "\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" is a song recorded by Julie Covington for the 1976 concept album Evita, and was later included in the 1978 musical of the same name. The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentinian leader Eva Per\u00f3n. It appears at the opening and near the end of the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, and finally during Eva's speech from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. Covington was signed by the songwriters for the track, based on her previous work in musicals.\n The Evita album had taken 3\u20134 months to record, since Rice was not satisfied with the intensity of the initial recordings. The song had a number of different titles before \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was chosen as the final one. The song shares its melody with \"Oh What a Circus\" from the same show and lyrically consists of platitudes where Eva tries to win the favour of the people of Argentina. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976 as the first single from the album, accompanied by national and trade advertising, full-colour posters, display sleeves as well as radio interviews.\n The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), with over a million copies sold. It also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands. \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was critically appreciated, with Rice and Lloyd Webber winning the 1977 Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically. When Evita moved to a London theatre, Covington\u2014who had become disenchanted with the whole project\u2014refused to reprise the part of Eva, and the role went to Elaine Paige. \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" has been covered by multiple artists, including The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, and Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor as well as actors Lea Michele and Chris Colfer from the TV series Glee\u200d.\n In 1996, American singer Madonna played the title role in the film adaptation of the musical and recorded her rendition of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\". Released as the second single from the film soundtrack on 4 February 1997, her version received positive reviews from music critics who praised her vocal performance. A separate version called the \"Miami Mix\", which included re-recorded vocals in English and Spanish and an Argentinian bandoneon, was promoted to radio. Madonna's version reached number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart and the national charts of the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, and Spain. It also became a top-ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 and many other charts worldwide, while attaining gold or platinum in six countries.",

  "/wiki/List_of_UK_Singles_Chart_number_ones_of_the_1970s": "The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) on behalf of the British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately \u00a352,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.\n In terms of number-one singles, ABBA were the most successful group of the decade having seven singles reach the top spot. The longest duration of a single at number-one was nine weeks and this was achieved on three occasions: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen in 1975; \"Mull of Kintyre\" / \"Girls' School\" by Wings in 1977 and \"You're the One That I Want\" by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John in 1978. Thirteen records were released that sold over one-million copies within the decade and \"Mull of Kintyre\" also became the first ever single to sell over two-million copies. In doing so it became the best-ever selling single beating the benchmark set by The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\"  in 1963. \"Mull of Kintyre\" was also the biggest selling song of the decade and was not surpassed in physical sales until 1984 when Band Aid released \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (which also featured McCartney).\n In 1973, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) was formed and they began certifying the sales of records at certain thresholds: \"silver\" (250,000\u00a0units), \"gold\" (500,000\u00a0units), and \"platinum\" (1,000,000\u00a0units).[nb 1] In 1977, the BPI held an awards ceremony at Wembley Conference Centre to mark the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The event cost \u00a325,000, honoured music from the last 25 years and is considered to be the first BRIT Awards ceremony."
