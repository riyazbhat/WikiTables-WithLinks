  "/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives": "Days of Our Lives (also stylized as Days of our Lives; often abbreviated to DOOL or Days) is an American daytime soap opera broadcast on NBC. It is one of the longest-running scripted television programs in the world, airing nearly every weekday since November 8, 1965.[dead link] A co-production of Corday Productions and Sony Pictures Television, the series was created by husband-and-wife team Ted Corday and Betty Corday. During Days of Our Lives' early years, Irna Phillips (creator of former NBC stablemate Another World as well as its former CBS rivals, As the World Turns and Guiding Light) served as a story editor for the program and many of the show's earliest storylines were written by William J. Bell (who would depart the series in 1975 to focus full-time on The Young and the Restless, which he created for CBS in 1973).\n The series primarily focuses on its core families, the Hortons and the Bradys. Several other families have been added to the cast, and many of them still appear on the show. Frances Reid, the matriarch of the series' Horton family, remained with the show from its inception to her death on February 3, 2010, although her last formal appearance occurred in December 2007. Suzanne Rogers is the longest-serving member of the program's current cast and the longest-serving current cast member of an ongoing American soap opera, having appeared on the show since August 1973.

Days of Our Lives is the most widely distributed soap opera in the United States, and has been syndicated to many countries around the world in the years since its debut. Days of Our Lives aired its 10,000th episode on February 21, 2005, and its 12,000th episode aired on January 11, 2013. The soap was given the title of most daring drama in the seventies due to covering topics other soaps would not dare to cover. The show's executive producer is Ken Corday (who has held that role since his mother, Betty, relinquished showrunning duties upon her semi-retirement from the program in 1986), and co-executive producers are Greg Meng and Albert Alarr. In November 2019, the show entered a planned four-month production hiatus; in January 2020, Days of Our Lives was renewed through September 2021. Since the cancellation of Passions in 2007, Days of Our Lives has been the only soap opera running on NBC.\n The show has been parodied by the sketch comedy series SCTV (as \"The Days of the Week\") and the sitcom Friends, with some cast members making crossover appearances on the show, including Kristian Alfonso, Roark Critchlow, Matthew Ashford, Kyle Lowder and Alison Sweeney. The show has had high-profile fans such as actress Julia Roberts and Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.",

  "/wiki/Soap_(TV_series)": "Soap is an American sitcom that originally ran on ABC from September 13, 1977, until April 20, 1981. The show was created as a night-time parody of daytime soap operas, presented as a weekly half-hour prime time comedy. Similar to a soap opera, the show's story was presented in a serial format, and featured melodramatic plotlines including alien abduction, demonic possession, extramarital affairs, murder, kidnapping, unknown diseases, amnesia, cults, organised crime warfare, a communist revolution and teacher-student relationships. In 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME\", and in 2010, the Tates and the Campbells ranked at number 17 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's Top Families\".\n The show was created, written, and executive produced by Susan Harris, and also executive produced by Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas. Each returning season was preceded by a 90-minute retrospective of the previous season. Two of these retrospectives were made available on VHS in 1994, but were not included on any DVD collections.\n The show aired 85 episodes over the course of four seasons. Eight of these (including the final four) aired as one-hour episodes during the original run on ABC. These hour-long episodes were later split in two, yielding 93 half-hour episodes for syndication. Like most sitcoms of the era, Soap was videotaped rather than filmed, but this coincidentally helped further its emulation of the daytime soap opera format, as most such productions were also videotaped.\n All episodes are currently available on region 1 DVD in four separate box sets. There is a box set of season 1 on region 2 DVD. The series has rerun in syndication on local channels as well as on cable.\n The show starred Katherine Helmond and Cathryn Damon as sisters/matriarchs of their own families.

It was the first soap opera to do a crossover, with the character of Mike Bauer from Guiding Light, which was also created by Irna Phillips, coming from Springfield to Bay City.
