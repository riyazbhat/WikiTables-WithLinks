  "/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai": "The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 epic war film directed by David Lean and based on the 1952 novel of the same name written by Pierre Boulle. The film uses the historical setting of the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942\u20131943. The cast included William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness, and Sessue Hayakawa. It was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson. Both writers had to work in secret, as they were on the Hollywood blacklist and had fled to the UK in order to continue working. As a result, Boulle, who did not speak English, was credited and received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; many years later, Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award. The film was widely praised, winning seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards. In 1997, the film was deemed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress.",
  "/wiki/David_Lean": "Sir David Lean CBE (25 March 1908 \u2013 16 April 1991) was an English film director, producer, screenwriter and editor. Widely considered as one of the most influential directors of all time, Lean was mostly famous for his large-scale epics such as The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965) and A Passage to India (1984). He also directed adaptations of  Charles Dickens novels Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948), and the romantic drama Brief Encounter (1945). Originally a film editor in the early 1930s, Lean made his directorial debut with 1942's In Which We Serve, which was the first of four collaborations with No\u00ebl Coward. Beginning with Summertime in 1955, Lean began to make internationally co-produced films financed by the big Hollywood studios; in 1970, however, the critical failure of his film Ryan's Daughter led him to take a fourteen-year break from filmmaking, during which he planned a number of film projects which never came to fruition. In 1984 he had a career revival with A Passage to India, adapted from E. M. Forster's novel; it was an instant hit with critics but proved to be the last film Lean would direct. Lean's affinity for pictorialism and inventive editing techniques has led him to be lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott. Lean was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute Sight & Sound Directors' Top Directors poll in 2002.",
  "/wiki/Columbia_Pictures": "Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. (commonly known as Columbia Pictures or simply Columbia) is an American film studio and production & distribution company that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of Sony Entertainment's Sony Pictures subsidiary of the Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony Corporation. What would eventually become Columbia Pictures, CBC Film Sales Corporation was founded on June 19, 1918 by Harry Cohn, his brother Jack Cohn, and Joe Brandt. It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, went public two years later, and eventually began to use the image of Columbia, the female personification of the United States, as its logo. In its early years, Columbia was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio.",
  "/wiki/Cinema_of_Germany": "The film industry in Germany can be traced back to the late 19th century.

Babelsberg became a household synonym for the early 20th century film industry in Europe, similar to Hollywood later.\n Germany witnessed major changes to its identity during the 20th and 21st century. Those changes determined the periodisation of national cinema into a succession of distinct eras and movements.",
  "/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_India": "The following is a list of highest-grossing films in India, with gross revenue in Indian rupees. This is not an official tracking of figures, as reliable sources that publish data are  frequently pressured to increase their estimates. Box office collections have been steadily increasing in the 21st century, the main reasons attributed to the rise in ticket prices, and increase in number of theatres and prints of a film. Most of the highest-grossing films at the domestic box office are Indian films, particularly from Bollywood, the Hindi-language film industry, followed by the Tamil (Kollywood) and the Telugu (Tollywood) and Bengali (Tallywood) film industries.

  "/wiki/Mother_India": "Mother India is a 1957 Indian epic drama film, directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Nargis, Sunil Dutt, Rajendra Kumar, and Raaj Kumar. A remake of Khan's earlier film Aurat (1940), it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha (Nargis), who in the absence of her husband, struggles to raise her sons and survive against a cunning money-lender amidst many troubles. The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film, and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The music by Naushad introduced global music, including Western classical music and orchestra, to Hindi cinema.",

But the total number of sold tickets during all years was bigger (former deputy director of the USSR GosKino Boris Pavlenok named 140 million, however, it was clearly exaggeration).
