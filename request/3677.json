President Theodore Roosevelt named the two forests in 1908 and they were merged in 1996. Forest headquarters are located in Dillon, Montana. In Roosevelt's original legislation, the Deerlodge National Forest was called the Big Hole Forest Reserve.

Ranchers and conservationists alike complained to Roosevelt, who made several trips to the area.\n(Munday 2001)",
