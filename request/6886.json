The seasoning is used to add color to many types of dishes in diverse cuisines. The trade in paprika expanded from the Iberian Peninsula to Africa and Asia,:8 and ultimately reached Central Europe through the Balkans, then under Ottoman rule, which explains the Hungarian origin of the English term.
