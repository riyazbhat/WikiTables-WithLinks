After the Second World War, the car division of the Bristol Aeroplane Company was formed, later becoming Bristol Cars Limited. Bristol has only one sales showroom, on Kensington High Street in London. Nevertheless, the company maintains an enthusiastic and loyal clientele. Bristol has always been a low-volume manufacturer; the most recent published official production figures were for 1982, which stated that 104 cars were produced in that year. The company suspended manufacturing in March 2011, when administrators were appointed, 22 staff were made redundant at the factory in Filton, Bristol and subsequently the company was dissolved. In April 2011, a new company was formed by the administrator to sell the original assets to Kamkorp. Since 2011, the company has been restoring and selling all models of the marque while a new model was being developed. The company had revealed a desire to return to automotive production in 2018 with an all-new model, called the Bullet, initially dubbed Project Pinnacle. The car was first revealed to the public on 26 July 2016, and homologation was set to have begun some time in 2018.",

The car uses a front-mounted 7,996 cc (487.9 cu in) V10 engine, based on the engine in the Dodge Viper and the Dodge Ram SRT-10 pick up (it was originally based on the Chrysler LA engine), but modified by Bristol to produce 525 bhp (391 kW; 532 PS) at 5,600 rpm and 525 lb\u22c5ft (712 N\u22c5m) of torque at 4,200 rpm. This is in keeping with Bristol's use of Chrysler engines since 1961. In the more powerful Fighter S, the engine is tuned to produce 628 hp (660 hp at high speed using the ram air effect). The car's weight is 1,600 kg (3,527 lb). The car has a six-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, and is rear-wheel drive. It can achieve the 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) sprint in 4.0 seconds (claimed), and enjoys a power-to-weight ratio of 267.8 kW/t (359.1 bhp/t). The car has a claimed top speed of 210 mph (340 km/h) and the driver can be 6 ft 7 in (2.0 m) tall at maximum.

  "/wiki/Land_Rover_Discovery": "Land Rover Discovery, also frequently just called Disco in slang or popular language, is a series of medium to large premium SUVs, produced under the Land Rover marque, from the British manufacturer Land Rover (becoming Jaguar Land Rover in 2013). The series is currently in its fifth iteration (or generation, according to the manufacturer), the first of which was introduced in 1989, making the Discovery the first new model series since the launch of the 1970 Range Rover - on which it was based - and only the third new product line since the conception of the Land Rover (vehicle and brand) by Rover in 1948. The model is sometimes called influential, as one of the first to market a true off-road capable family car. The initial Discovery was essentially created as a more affordable design fork of the standard wheelbase Range Rover of the time. Although positioned below the latter in the company's line-up, the vehicle was both longer and higher, offered more room in the back, and optionally also more seats. Space utilization became more sophisticated in later iterations, but the series keeps offering seats for seven occupants. The second Discovery (1998) was called the Series II, and though featuring an extended rear body, was otherwise an updated face-lift, which carried on the 100 inch wheelbase (2.54 m) frame and rigid, live front and rear axles of the original Range Rover into 2004. The third iteration - succeeding the series I and II in 2004 - was either titled the Discovery 3 or simply LR3 (in North America and The Middle East). This was the first all-original design for the Discovery. Although it followed the 2002 third generation Range Rover, also switching to fully independent suspension, it still received a separate, but integrated body and frame (IBF) structure. The fourth iteration, as of 2009 - like the series II, was again mainly an update of the new generation - marketed as the Discovery 4, or Land Rover LR4 for North American and Middle Eastern markets. The fifth iteration of the Discovery, introduced in 2017, no longer sports a numeric suffix.",
