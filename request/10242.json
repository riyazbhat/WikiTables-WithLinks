The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States. Under British rule, a settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British. A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States. Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port.

In the 1920s Mizner was the best-known and most-discussed living American architect. :5 Palm Beach, Florida, which he transformed, was his home, and most of his houses are there. He believed that architecture should also include interior and garden design, and set up Mizner Industries to have a reliable source of components. He was an architect with a philosophy and a dream. :5 Boca Raton, Florida, began as Mizner's project. The 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m), 250-pound (110 kg) bon vivant epitomized the society architect. Rejecting other modern architects for producing a characterless copybook effect, he sought to make a building look traditional and as though it had fought its way from a small, unimportant structure to a great, rambling house that took centuries of different needs and ups and downs of wealth to accomplish. I sometimes start a house with a Romanesque corner, pretend that it has fallen into disrepair and been added to in the Gothic spirit, when suddenly the great wealth of the New World has poured in and the owner had added a very rich Renaissance addition. Or as he described his own never-built castle, drawings of which were part of his promotional literature, it would be a Spanish fortress of the twelfth century captured from its owner by a stronger enemy who, after taking it, adds on one wing and another, and then loses it in turn to another who builds to suit his taste. :21 As these quotes suggest, many Mizner buildings contain styles from more than one period, but all foreign.",
