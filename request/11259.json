In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly (colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \"put forward views and proposals\" with \"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\".

  "/wiki/Burnhope_transmitting_station": "The Burnhope transmitting station was originally built by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) as its sole 405-line transmitting station service the Tyne Tees Television region. Test transmissions started in December 1958 approximately one month before the launch on Tyne Tees Television on 15 January 1959. It was built close to the existing BBC Band I station at Pontop Pike. This was the eighth transmitter opened by the ITA. From the station's 750 foot mast, transmissions from Burnhope were on VHF Channel 8 at a peak vision ERP of 100 kW, successfully covering a region spanning the North Yorkshire moorlands and Teesside in the South, to the remote upper reaches of Northumberland in the North. With the advent of UHF with its 625-lines, the adjacent Pontop Pike transmitting station carried these services to the Newcastle and County Durham area from 1967 onwards, confining Burnhope to 405-line transmission. In due course, further main UHF transmissions were established at Bilsdale West Moor (serving North Yorkshire and Teesside) and Chatton (serving upper Northumberland). The transmitter would later get a new lease of life with the advent of Independent Local Radio (commercial radio or ILR).",
