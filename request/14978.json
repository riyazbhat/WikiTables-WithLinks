  "/wiki/Open-pit_mining": "Open-pit, open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.\n This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface. It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand, cinder, and gravel). In contrast, minerals that have been found underground but are difficult to retrieve due to hard rock, can be reached using a form of underground mining.\n To create an open-pit mine, the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground. This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground, then plotting each hole location on a map. The information gained through the holes with provide an idea of the vertical extent of the ore's body. This vertical information is then used to pit tentative locations of the benches that will occur in the mine. It is important to consider the grade and economic value of the ore in the potential pit. Open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as \"quarries.\"\n Open-pit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted, or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic. When this occurs, the exhausted mines are sometimes converted to landfills for disposal of solid wastes. However, some form of water control is usually required to keep the mine pit from becoming a lake, if the mine is situated in a climate of considerable precipitation or if any layers of the pit forming the mine border productive aquifers.\n Open-pit mining is to be considered one of the most dangerous sectors in the industrial world. It causes significant effects to miners health, as well as damage to the ecological land. Open-pit mining causes changes to vegetation, soil, and bedrock, which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology, groundwater levels, and flow paths. Additionally, open-pit produces harmful pollutants depending on the type of mineral being mined, and the type of mining process being used.",
  "/wiki/Mountain_biking": "Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into multiple categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as \"Enduro\"), downhill, freeride and dirt jumping. \n This sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.\n Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, wider bike park trails, fire roads, and some advanced trails are designed with jumps, berms, and drop-off to add excitement to the trail.  Riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the summer to ride downhill specific trails, using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes. Because riders are often far from civilization, there is a strong ethic of self-reliance in the sport. Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded. Many riders carry a backpack, including water, food, tools for trailside repairs, and a first aid kit in case of injury. Group rides are common, especially on longer treks.

The Ojibwe name for the area is Gichi-biitoobiig, which means \"great duplicate water,\" \"parallel body of water\" or \"double body of water\" (like a bayou), a reference to the two bays which form the large harbor of Lake Superior.\n The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s, and the French Canadian Voyageurs termed the settled village \u2018Grand Marais\u2019 which is French for \"Great Marsh\", referring to a marsh that, in early fur-trading times, was 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there. Another small bay on the east, less protected from storms, is separated from the harbor by a slight projecting point and a short beach. Also, \u2018Grand Marais\u2019 also may mean \"sheltered water area,\" as the harbor has natural breakwall rock outcroppings, providing for a natural safe harbor for early Lake Superior explorers.\n Located on the east side of Grand Marais is Chippewa City. Chippewa City thrived in the 1890s, with about 100 families living in the village. The historic Francis Xavier church still stands slightly north of town, just off Highway 61. The church began as a Jesuit mission from Fort William, Ontario in 1855 to minister to the Ojibwe residents of the area. The permanent structure was built in 1895 and was used until declining attendance forced it to close in 1936. The Cook County Historical society restored the site between 1970 and 1974 and it was added to the National Register in 1986.\n Grand Marais is a gateway to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, with the Gunflint Trail, historically a footpath for travelers and fur traders from inland lakes to Lake Superior.

He was one of a succession of Mdewakanton Dakota chiefs whose name \"Red Wing\" came from their use of a dyed swan's wing as their symbol of rank. He was an ally of British soldiers during the War of 1812. After a vision in which he saw the Americans driving out the British, he declared neutrality. French Canadians referred to him as L'Aile Rouge. Later he took the name Shakea, or \"The Man Who Paints Himself Red,\" after passing the name Red Wing on to a successor chief.[citation needed]\n During the lifetime of Hupahuduta, there were few European-American pioneers in his territory. Red Wing was known as a firm friend of the United States, keeping peace with the traders and settlers, and trading for goods that were valued by his tribe.[citation needed] The federal government established a Mdewakanton Sioux Indian reservation in 1889 along the Mississippi River to free up land for new settlers.

The region escaped the flattening effects of glaciation during the last ice age and is consequently characterized by steep, forested ridges, deeply carved river valleys, and karst geology characterized by spring-fed waterfalls and cold-water trout streams. Ecologically, the Driftless Area's flora and fauna are more closely related to those of the Great Lakes region and New England than those of the broader Midwest and central Plains regions. Colloquially, the term includes the incised Paleozoic Plateau of southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa. The region includes elevations ranging from 603 to 1,719\u00a0feet (184 to 524\u00a0m) at Blue Mound State Park and covers 24,000 square miles (62,200\u00a0km2). The rugged terrain is due both to the lack of glacial deposits, or drift, and to the incision of the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries into bedrock.\n An alternative, less restrictive definition of the Driftless Area includes the sand Plains region northeast of Wisconsin's portion of the incised Paleozoic Plateau in the southwestern part of the state. This part of the Driftless Area in the southwestern section of Wisconsin's Central Plain also lacks evidence of glaciation (although it was modified by glacial meltwaters that collected in Glacial Lake Wisconsin), and contains many isolated hills, bluffs, mesas, buttes, and pinnacles that are outlying eroded Cambrian bedrock remnants of the plateau to the southwest.",

  "/wiki/Luce_Line_State_Trail": "The Electric Short Line Railway, also known as Luce Electric Lines, was a railroad that operated in Minnesota, originating in Minneapolis and heading westward.  The railroad owes its nickname to the fact it was operated by members of the Luce family.  The railroad ultimately reached beyond Clara City to Gluek.  Today, the line has mostly been abandoned, but its former right-of-way now hosts the Luce Line State Trail operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The Luce Line Regional Trail operated by the Three Rivers Park District connects to the state trail, but runs on roads and paths that roughly parallel what remains of the Luce Electric Lines.\n The Electric Short Line Railway and the affiliated Electric Short Line Railroad (later renamed the Electric Short Line Terminal Co.) were incorporated in late 1908.  Construction started in 1909, but it took until 1913 for the first 3.2 miles to be completed from 3rd Avenue and 7th Street North (construction was in various stages of completion for the next 30 miles, however).  That spot was originally known as Boagen Green, then became Luce Line Junction when the Dan Patch Line reached it.  It eventually became known as Glenwood Junction.  Rail east of that point was owned by the ESL Terminal Co., while rail to the west was owned by the ESL Railway.  17.8 miles were complete by mid-1914, 47.5 by mid-1915, and 70.9 miles by the end of 1917 (although some of this included double-tracking), reaching Hutchinson.\n Backers of the line had originally planned to reach Brookings, South Dakota, and construction westward resumed in 1922 with completion to Cosmos and extension to Lake Lillian the following year.  However, the railroad fell into foreclosure in 1924, and the Electric Short Line Railway came under the control of the Minnesota Western Railroad (later known as the Minneapolis Industrial Railway), which had been formed by the ESL Railway's bondholders. The Luce family lost control of the company when it was purchased by Minneapolis, Northfield & Southern in 1927. MN&S predecessor Dan Patch Lines had a very early relationship with the Luce Line having built a connection to the Luce Line from Auto Club in Bloomington to Glenwood Junction in Golden Valley in 1915, and had used the track from Glenwood Junction to the terminal in Minneapolis for many years. After Dan Patch ceased operations in 1916, the organization of the MN&S in 1918 helped secure the Luce Line profitability as MN&S became a very important beltline allowing inbound shipments to Minneapolis to avoid the crowded railyards between St Paul and Minneapolis.\n Despite the \"Electric Short Line\" name, the railroad never operated electric locomotives. Passenger service used gasoline-electric railcars manufactured by General Electric and Wason Car Company, though one gasoline-mechanical McKeen Motor Car Company railcar also saw use.  The railcars often towed extra passenger cars as trailers.  Freight trains were pulled by steam locomotives.\n The Minnesota Western Railway continued to operate passenger service into the late 1940s, but was reduced to just one passenger railcar by the end of 1942. Passenger service finally ended in 1947.\n The Minnesota Western Railway was acquired by the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1956 and was renamed Minneapolis Industrial Railway in early 1960. M&StL came under control of the Chicago and North Western Railway on November 1, 1960, and with a stroke of a pen, the MW was doomed. The MW would be targeted for abandonment at the earliest possible date and the well-tested C&NW formula of forcing abandonments immediately took hold on the MW. Deferred maintenance and denial of service as well as other components of the C&NW formula were all employed. In 1967, C&NW asked the Minnesota Railroad and Warehouse Commission for permission to abandon the Gluek to Hutchinson segment. Protests against abandonment were logged, but C&NW tore up the line almost immediately after the MRWC approved abandonment. Just one year later, the C&NW was back before the MRWC to ask permission to abandon the line from Hutchinson to Plymouth. The MRWC approved the abandonment, and by mid-1970, 104 miles of the former Luce Line had been torn from the ground between Plymouth, Minnesota, and Gluek. Chicago and North Western was merged into the Union Pacific Railroad in 1995, and the remnants of the Luce Line between Interstate 494 and downtown Minneapolis are now operated as the UP's Golden Valley Industrial Lead.",

Young from New Brunswick, and Daniel Hoyt from Massachusetts.  The first two were the first farmers and they planted wheat.  Hoyt suggested the name when the Township was organized on January 25, 1870.  He had come in 1867 as a surveyor, and he was elected the first township clerk.  He froze to death in February 1870, trying to walk on foot to the Minnesota River.  Cosmos is an ancient Greek word meaning \u201corder and harmony in the universe\u201d.  The city was incorporated as a village on September 21, 1926, and finally as a city in 1969.  A post office was established as in Renville County in 1870, then to McLeod County in 1871, and finally, it was transferred to Meeker County in 1872. Isaac Layton was the postmaster.  The post office closed in 1906 and re-opened in 1924.  The town had a railway station serving several rail lines including the Minnesota and Western Railroad.  The town sits along the South Fork of the Crow River. The population was 473 at the 2010 census. The banks in Meeker County starting improving their security systems in March 1925 after there was a rash of bank break-ins in Cold Spring, Prinsburg, Cosmos and Svea in 1924 and 1925. Three men made an attempt to rob the Cosmos First State Bank on Tuesday, April 21, 1924.  The bandits parked out of town and walked into the sleepy little community where they got into the bank through a basement window.  Before they came into town a little after one in the morning, they cut all the telephone and telegraph wires leading in and out of the town.  One man was left to stand guard outside the bank.     \nInside the bank, the other two packed the safe with explosives and set them off.   The door opened, but the thieves were confronted with an upper and a lower compartment inside.  Eeny meeny, miney moe...the duo opted for \u201cmoe\u201d, the lower one, which they then blew open too.   Unfortunately, the bank's $5,000 in cash was in \u201cminey\u201d, the upper compartment.  The money had been received just the night before to pay the members of the local creamery.  Do you suppose a creamery employee was involved in the attempted heist, tipping off some buddies?  \nThe noise from the first explosion aroused garage owner Emil August Hackbarth from his sleep.  He lived right across the street from the bank.  Apparently, Emil didn't like to be woke up.  He reached for his revolver, which he conveniently kept near his bed, and went to his window facing the bank.  He calmly fired off a shot.  I don't know if he even saw the lookout there or not, but J. H. Jerabek, who lived a couple of houses down the street certainly did.  Jerabek, the bank cashier, lit a lamp and stepped out onto his porch, where he ran into a shotgun.\n\u201cGet back in there, or I\u2019ll blow your damned head off,\u201d Jerabek was told.  He went back in but inside he immediately grabbed his own shotgun, but he couldn't find any shells.  Alerted by the lookout that the town was waking up, the two men inside the bank opened a window and climbed out.  The three of them then ran off to their car and sped off, never to be seen or heard of again.\n Minnesota State Highways 4 (Milkyway Street) and 7 (Astro Blvd.) are the two of the main routes in the town. In keeping with the community's space theme, all streets are named after planets and all avenues are named after constellations.\nOn the third weekend in July, the city holds the Cosmos Space Festival. It features Minn-E-Rods, a softball tournament, a volleyball tournament, an antique tractor pull, meals in the park, pig races, a Space Festival parade, fireworks, a pancake breakfast, a pork chop dinner, church in the park, music entertainment, crafters, a pedal tractor pull, a disc golf tournament, laser tag, a bean bag tournament, citywide garage sales, drawings, and many other activities.",

It flows southeast to Mankato, then turns northeast. It joins the Mississippi south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, near the historic Fort Snelling. The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota.
