With the exception of the 2013 season, in which a collision with Joey Logano damaged his lower back and kept him out for a large part of the early season, Hamlin has competed in the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs in every season he has competed full-time (12 seasons as of 2018), including his rookie season in 2006 when he finished third in the Chase for the NASCAR Nextel Cup standings, capping off one of the most impressive rookie campaigns in modern NASCAR history. \n Since his appearance in the Cup Series, Hamlin has been one of the most consistent drivers in the sport, winning at least one race from the 2006 to 2017 Cup seasons and again from 2019 to 2020. The 2019 season also saw him reach the playoffs' Championship Round with a six-win season, the most since 2010. These title near-misses have firmly established Hamlin as one of the best drivers in history to have never won a NASCAR Cup Championship.",
