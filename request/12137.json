That game saw a goal explosion from a Milan side that had been extremely defensive during the entire league season, which in part caused the Italian Football Federation to introduce three points for victories starting in the autumn 1994. Milan won Serie A with a mere 36 goals scored in 34 games, but conceding a mere 15, which meant they had the defensive line, with Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini as key players, to thank for their third consecutive domestic success. Milan's match against struggling Reggiana at San Siro on 1 May 1994 came on a day when the sporting world was overshadowed with the death of racing driver Ayrton Senna in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, but the football world was focused on AC Milan's attempts to seal a 14th title. It was a narrow 1\u20130 defeat for Reggiana, with a goal from Massimiliano Esposito, but enough to seal the Scudetto.",
