  "/wiki/ISBN": "The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique. [a][b] Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency. An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country. The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit '0').",

  "/wiki/Morwenna_Donnelly": "Marjorie Donnelly (1917\u20131991), known as Morwenna Donnelly, was a British writer who won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1942 for her book-length poem Beauty and Ashes. Poet Sidney Keyes reviewed Beauty and Ashes in the periodical Kingdom Come and wrote that like Rilke she is finally answered, and accepts the revelation. That is the important fact; comparing her favourably to Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1967, she sent a letter to the editor to The Times in defense of The Sound of Music, which the newspaper had criticised as appealing mainly to simple housewives or those living in unlovely surroundings. She wrote, It is certainly happy, beautiful and gay; but it also reiterates the fact that individuals can solve their problems, and face danger and disaster, if they stand on firm ground and not on a spiritual quagmire of rotten values. I suggest it is this positive and hopeful note which strikes such a deep chord in audiences. She listed her address as Ashdon Hall, in Saffron Walden, Essex.",
