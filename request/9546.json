  "/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland": "The 26 cantons of Switzerland (German: Kanton, French: canton, Italian: cantone, Romansh: chantun) are the member states of the Swiss Confederation. The nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the form of the first three confederate allies used to be referred to as the Waldst\u00e4tte. Two further major steps in the development of the Swiss cantonal system are referred to by the terms Acht Orte (\"Eight Cantons\"; between 1353 and 1481) and Dreizehn Orte (\"Thirteen Cantons\", during 1513\u20131798); they were important intermediate periods of the Ancient Swiss Confederacy.\n Each canton, formerly also \nOrt (from before 1450), or Stand (\"estate\", from c. 1550), was a fully sovereign state with its own border controls, army, and currency from at least the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848, with a brief period of centralised government during the Helvetic Republic (1798\u20131803). The term Kanton was widely used since then.\n From 1833, there were 25 cantons, increasing to 26 after the secession of the canton of Jura from Bern in 1979.\n The areas of the cantons vary from 37 km2 (canton of Basel-Stadt) to 7,105 km2 (canton of Grisons); the populations vary from 16,003 (canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden) to 1,487,969 (canton of Z\u00fcrich).",
  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area. The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area, and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas.\n In sociology, population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race. Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations. \nPopulation, in a more simple term, is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).",
  "/wiki/Z\u00fcrich": "Z\u00fcrich (German: Z\u00fcrich; French: Zurich; Italian: Zurigo; Romansh: Turitg) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Z\u00fcrich. It is located in north-central Switzerland at the northwestern tip of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The municipality has approximately 430,000 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million and the Z\u00fcrich metropolitan area 1.83 million. Z\u00fcrich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.\n Permanently settled for over 2,000 years, Z\u00fcrich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15 BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early).  During the Middle Ages, Z\u00fcrich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.\n The official language of Z\u00fcrich is German,[a] but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Z\u00fcrich German.\n Many museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus and newer Theater 11 in Oerlikon. Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich is one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.\n Z\u00fcrich is among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population. The city is home to many financial institutions and banking companies. Many of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in the Greater Z\u00fcrich area and the low tax rates and canton funding subsidies attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters or finance treasury services in the city.[citation needed]\nMonocle's 2012 \"Quality of Life Survey\" ranked Z\u00fcrich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world \"to make a base within\".
