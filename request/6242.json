Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of approximately 2.5 million, and the South East Queensland metropolitan region, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.6 million.[failed verification]\n The Brisbane central business district stands on the historic European settlement and is situated inside a peninsula of the Brisbane River, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) from its mouth at Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. It sprawls across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs)\u2014most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is \"Brisbanite\", whilst common nicknames include \"Brissy\", \"River City\" and \"Brisvegas\".\n One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located\u2014which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's founding\u2014the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17\u00a0mi) north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur.\n A diverse city with 32.2% of its metropolitan population being foreign born, Brisbane is ranked as a world city, and ranks highly in ratings of livable cities. Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city's built heritage. Brisbane was also the origin of the Anzac Day tradition through the works of Canon David John Garland.\n A transportation hub, Brisbane is served by a large suburban rail network, popular bus and ferry networks as well as Australia's third-busiest airport and seaport.\n Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo '88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.\n Brisbane is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to numerous popular surf beaches, located immediately south and north of Brisbane respectively.

William Henry Lindsay was the purchaser. By 1892 the property was selling wool at the Melbourne market.\n In 1903 the store and a part of the homestead burnt down resulting in the loss hundreds of pounds worth of stores.\n The Arrabury Pastoral Company was formed in 1917 with \u00a330,000 of capital to acquire the 945 square miles (2,448\u00a0km2) Arrabury and surrounding leases.
