  "/wiki/Shoot_'em_up": "Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of video games within the shooter subgenre in the action genre. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives.\n The genre's roots can be traced back to Spacewar!, one of the earliest computer games, developed in 1962. The shoot 'em up genre was later established by the hit arcade game Space Invaders, which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978, and the genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as Asteroids and Galaxian in 1979. Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s, and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts, particularly in Japan. \"Bullet hell\" games are a subgenre that features overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles, often in visually impressive formations.",

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games, or platformers, are a video game genre and subgenre of action game. In a platformer, the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles. Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed. The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks, as in Ristar or Bionic Commando, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in Alpha Waves. These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called platforming, a verbification of platform. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series, fall outside of the genre.\n Platform games originated in the early 1980s, which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping, with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s. The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established, no later than 1983. The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres, such as the shooter elements in Contra, Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe, adventure elements of Flashback, or role-playing game elements of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.\n While commonly associated with console gaming, there have been many important platform games released to video arcades, as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers. North America, Europe and Japan have played major parts in the genre's evolution. Platform themes range from cartoon-like games to science fiction and fantasy epics.\n At one point, platform games were the most popular genre of video game. At the peak of their popularity, it is estimated that between one-quarter and one-third of console games were platformers, but these have since been supplanted by first-person shooters. As of 2006, the genre had become far less dominant, representing a two percentage market share as compared to fifteen percent in 1998, but is still commercially viable, with a number of games selling in the millions of units. Since 2010, a variety of endless running platformers for mobile devices have brought renewed popularity to the genre.",
  "/wiki/Strider_(arcade_game)": "Strider, released in Japan as Strider Hiry\u016b (\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u98db\u7adc, Sutoraid\u0101 Hiry\u016b), is a 1989 side-scrolling action platformer developed and released for the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom. Strider is a hack and slash platformer set in a dystopian future in the year 2048 and features a wide range of settings that dramatically affect gameplay.\n Strider marked the video game debut of Hiryu, a member of a secret group of ninjas known as the \u201cStriders\u201d shortly after the character's 1988 debut as the main character in a manga titled Strider Hiryu.\n Hiryu went on to become the main protagonist of a long-running series of video games and one of Capcom's most popular characters.\nThe arcade game is part of a three-way cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher Moto Kikaku, which also includes a manga book and an NES video game.\n Ports for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, IBM PC compatibles, and ZX Spectrum were developed by Tiertex and published by U.S. Gold in 1989.\n Sega ported Strider to its own Genesis console in 1990 to wide acclaim. Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the 1990 Video Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly and being featured in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. Strider's innovative, fast-paced gameplay is cited as a major influence on several popular video game franchises such as Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry and God of War. It became one of Capcom's early big hits prior to Street Fighter II, hailed for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.",

  "/wiki/Beat_'em_up": "Beat 'em up (also known as brawler) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents. Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open three-dimensional (3D) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies. These games are noted for their simple gameplay, a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre. Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, science fiction or fantasy themes.\n The first beat 'em up was 1984's Kung-Fu Master, with 1986's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and led to 1991's Street Fighter II, which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games. Games such as Streets of Rage, Final Fight, Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are other classics to emerge from this period. The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments. In recent years, the genre has seen a resurgence in Asia, with the success of South Korean online beat 'em up Dungeon Fighter Online (2004).",

By 1993, two years after its launch, sales were over $1.5 billion in gross revenue, and by 1994, the game had been played by over 25 million people in the United States at home and in arcades. In 1995, total sales of Street Fighter II and Street Fighter II: Championship Edition machines exceeded $2.312 billion. Adjusted for inflation, it is estimated that all versions of Street Fighter II exceed $10 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing video games of all time.

Street Fighter II is regarded as one of the best video games of all time, and in particular the most important and influential fighting game made.

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters, in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed. The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires. The matches typically consist of several rounds, in an arena, with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \"combos\". Starting in the early 1990s, most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.\n The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976, but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984. The following year, Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles, while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems. In 1987, Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks. In 1991, Capcom's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre. The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s, particularly in arcades.
