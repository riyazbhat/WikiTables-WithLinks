  "/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) Finals is the championship series for the NBA and the conclusion of its postseason. All Finals have been played in a best-of-seven format, and are contested between the winners of the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference (formerly Divisions before 1970), except in 1950 when the Eastern Division champion faced the winner between the Western and Central Division champions. From 1946 through 1949, when the league was known as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the playoffs were a three-stage tournament where the two semifinal winners played each other in the finals. The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy.\n The current home-and-away format in the NBA Finals is 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 (the team with the better regular-season record plays on their home court in Games 1, 2, 5, and 7), which has been used in 1947\u20131948, 1950\u20131952, 1957\u20131970, 1972\u20131974, 1976\u20131977, 1979\u20131984, and 2014\u2013present. It was previously in a 2\u20133\u20132 format (the team with the better regular season record plays on their home court in Games 1, 2, 6, and 7) during 1949, 1953\u20131955, and 1985\u20132013, in a 1\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131 format during 1956 and 1971, and in a 1\u20132\u20132\u20131\u20131 format during 1975 and 1978.\n The Eastern Conference/Division leads the Western Conference/Division in series won (39\u201334). The defunct Central Division, in existence during the 1949\u201350 NBA season when the NBA was divided into three divisions and different from the current Central Division created in 1970 when the then existing Eastern Division was upgraded as a conference, won one championship. The Boston Celtics and the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers alone own almost half of the titles, having won a combined 33 of 73 championships. As of 2019[update], the defending champions are the Toronto Raptors, making history as the first team from outside of the United States to win.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Golden_State_Warriors_seasons": "The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco, California. The franchise has also been based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Oakland and San Jose, California (during a renovation of its home arena). The team is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946 and won the first BAA championship title in the same year, under coach Edward Gottlieb. The Warriors joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26\u201342 in their first NBA season, and they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962\u201363 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. After playing several home games in Oakland from 1967 onward, the team moved to Oakland full-time for the 1971\u201372 NBA season and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors.\n Led by Rick Barry, the Warriors were a strong franchise during the middle 1970s, achieving winning records every season from 1971\u201372 to 1977\u201378, winning two division titles, and winning the 1975 NBA championship. After Barry departed at the end of the 1977\u201378 season, however, the Warriors were not in the hunt for a title for the next 35 seasons. Between 1978\u201379 and 2011\u201312, the Warriors only achieved winning records in eight seasons. The team also suffered the NBA\u2019s fourth-longest postseason appearance drought in history, with no playoff appearances between 1994\u201395 and 2005\u201306; this mark trails only the Braves/Clippers between 1976\u201377 and 1990\u201391, the Timberwolves between 2004\u201305 and 2016\u201317, and the Kings from 2006\u201307 to 2018\u201319 (still active)\n Led by NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry, the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win the 2015 NBA championship. In the following season, the Warriors--boosted by over half a decade of skillful drafting--finished with the best record in NBA history; the team ended the 2015\u201316 season with a mark of 73\u20139, one win better than Michael Jordan\u2019s 1995\u201396 Bulls. The Warriors reached the 2016 NBA Finals but were defeated by the Cavaliers in seven games. After adding Kevin Durant in the off-season, they won 67 games during the 2016\u201317 campaign. The Warriors set another NBA record by winning 207 games during the three-year period ending in 2017. In the 2017 NBA Finals, the Warriors faced the Cavaliers again and won the NBA title in five games. In 2018, meeting the Cavaliers in the finals for the fourth consecutive season, the Warriors swept the series, winning the final game 108\u201385. In 2019, the Warriors returned to the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive time, losing to the Toronto Raptors in six games.",

In the NBA Finals, LeBron James was named NBA Finals MVP.\n The Cavaliers swept their first two series and won the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Raptors to become the fourth team in NBA history to open a post-season with 10 straight victories.  They matched the 2012 San Antonio Spurs, though the 1989 and 2001 Los Angeles Lakers had won their first eleven games en route to sweeping the first three rounds of the playoffs.  Cleveland wound up repeating this feat the next year, when they swept the conference opening round, semifinal round, and winning the first 2 conference final games. However, this feat would be surpassed by the 2017 Golden State Warriors, who won 15 straight games.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Boston_Celtics_seasons": "This is a list of seasons completed by the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association. It documents the team\u2019s season-by-season records, including post-season records, and also includes year-end awards won by the team's players and/or coaches.\n With seventeen NBA Championships, the Celtics have won more than any other NBA franchise, while the 1959-to-1966 domination of the NBA Championship, with eight straight titles, is the longest consecutive championship winning streak of any North American professional sports team to date. Following this, the Celtics had two major periods of success separated by quite poor seasons during rebuilding. Between 1971\u201372 and 1975\u201376 the Celtics, led by Dave Cowens and John Havlicek, won 294 of 410 regular season games and reached the conference finals in each of those five seasons, winning two more NBA championships, whilst between 1979\u201380 and 1987\u201388 led by the frontcourt of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish the Celtics won 550 of 742 regular season games and reached every Conference Final except for 1982\u201383 when they were swept in the Conference Semifinals by the Milwaukee Bucks. The Celtics have had 13 separate seasons where they won 60 or more regular season contests, the highest number for any franchise.\n Between 1993\u201394 and 2006\u201307 the Celtics had their single sustained period of failure, with an overall win percent of .423 and only twice getting beyond the first playoff round. With the acquisition of Kevin Garnett for 2007\u201308, the Celtics achieved a record single-season rise in win percentage to claim their first title in twenty-two seasons, in the process achieving the best average point differential between the 1995\u201396 Bulls and the 2015\u201316 Warriors. The team remained a power until after the 2011 lockout, but lost to the Lakers in their most recent Finals appearance.\n The Celtics are 23\u20138 all-time in seventh games of playoff series, and 7\u20131 in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Houston_Rockets_seasons": "The Houston Rockets are an American professional basketball team based in Houston, Texas. The Rockets play in the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1967, and played in San Diego, California for four years, before moving to Houston, Texas.\n In the Rockets' debut season, their win-loss record was 15\u201367. After drafting Elvin Hayes first overall in the 1968 NBA Draft, they made their first appearance in the playoffs in 1969. After Hayes was traded, Moses Malone replaced him. Malone won two Most Valuable Player awards during his time in Houston, and led the Rockets to the 1977 Eastern Conference finals in his first year with the Rockets. He also led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, but they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics. Two years after advancing to the finals, the Rockets won a franchise-low 14 games.\n In 1984, the Rockets drafted future Hall-of-Famer Hakeem Olajuwon, who led them to the 1986 Finals in his second year, in which they lost again to Boston. In the next seven seasons, they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times. They did not win their first championship until 1994, when Olajuwon led them to a franchise-best 58 wins, and the championship. The Rockets repeated the feat in 1995, but have not advanced to the finals since. They missed the playoffs from 1999 to 2003, and did not reach the playoffs until after they drafted Yao Ming in 2003. They did not advance past the first round of the playoffs for 13 years, until the 2008\u201309 NBA season. After the arrival of James Harden in 2012 and Dwight Howard the following year, the Rockets had their best seasons since the Olajuwon days, culminating in the Southwest Division title and a return to the Western Conference Finals in 2015. The 2017\u201318 Rockets made franchise history by becoming the first Houston team ever to win 60 or more games in a regular season, finishing at 65\u201317.\n The Rockets have played 52 seasons, and advanced to the playoffs in 33 of those seasons. They have won seven division titles, and have been conference champions four times. Their overall record is 2,225 wins and 1,991 losses.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Philadelphia_76ers_seasons": "The Philadelphia 76ers, often referred to as the \"Sixers\", are an American professional basketball team based in Philadelphia. The Sixers play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In sixty-six NBA seasons, the franchise has played in the NBA Finalsnine times and never won. The Sixers have the third-highest victory total and third most playoff appearances in NBA history. Since 1996, the Sixers have played home games at Wells Fargo Center.\n In 1937, owner Daniel Biasone founded the franchise as the Syracuse Nationals, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs three times then joined the NBA in 1949, one of seven NBL teams to merge with the rival Basketball Association of America (BAA). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs in every season played in Syracuse, advancing to three Finals and Losing. For the 1963\u201364 season, the year following the departure of the Philadelphia Warriors for San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia as the 76ers.\n The franchise has played fifty-three seasons as the Philadelphia 76ers, with thirty-three playoff appearances and zero championships. The Sixers acquired Philadelphia-native Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 from the Warriors and defeated Chamberlain's former team in the 1967 Finals, but suffered a sharp fall from grace due to the loss of Chamberlain to retirement and Billy Cunningham to the ABA: in 1972\u201373 the team won only nine games, the fewest in an 82-game NBA season. Under coaches Gene Shue and Cunningham, and the on-court leadership of forward Julius Erving, the 76ers returned as a power quite rapidly, achieving winning records in all but one season from 1975\u201376 to 1990\u201391. The Sixers won their last title in 1983 against the Los Angeles Lakers, sweeping them in four games.\n During the 1990s, the 76ers declined to an 18\u201364 record in 1995\u201396 before popular high-scoring guard Allen Iverson led the team back up the table. In 2000\u201301 the Iverson-led 76ers won fifty-six games and defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals to reach the 2001 Finals but lost to the Lakers four games to one in the best-of-seven series. The 76ers were a middle-of-the-road team on-court during the following dozen seasons, but by the early 2010s financial problems led incoming general manager Sam Hinkie to clean out any expensive players in order to save money and gain draft choices for the future. Lacking on-court talent, the 76ers set many records for ineptitude in the following three seasons, becoming the second NBA team after the 1995\u201396 to 1998\u201399 Grizzlies to suffer three consecutive seasons winning fewer than twenty games. In 2015\u201316 by going 10\u201372 the 76ers suffered the ignominy of having suffered the two all-time worst 82-game NBA season winning percentages.[note 1]",
