Most of the game requires the player to complete a linear sequence of challenges that involve jumping over obstacles, solving puzzles, and fighting enemies. A multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types is also included. Designed for mature audiences, Conker's Bad Fur Day features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor, and pop culture references. Conker's Bad Fur Day was developed over the course of four years. Although it was originally designed for a family audience, the game was retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. Upon release, Conker's Bad Fur Day was acclaimed by video game critics, who praised its visual appeal and smart, funny humour.",
