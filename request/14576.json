The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35\u201310.\n Coming into this game, considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL, thus the teams representing the two rival leagues (Kansas City and Green Bay, respectively) felt pressure to win. The Chiefs posted an 11\u20132\u20131 record during the 1966 AFL season, and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31\u20137, in the AFL Championship Game. The Packers finished the 1966 NFL season at 12\u20132, and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34\u201327 in the NFL Championship Game. Still, many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL, and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City.\n The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive, as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards, 181\u2013164, to come within 14\u201310 at halftime. Early in the 3rd quarter, Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line. The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half. Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr, who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, was named MVP.\n It remains the only Super Bowl to have been simulcast in the United States by two networks.

The Colts defeated the Cowboys by the score of 16\u201313 on a field goal with 5 seconds left in the game. The game was played on January 17, 1971, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, the first Super Bowl game played on artificial turf, on first-generation Poly-Turf.\n This was the first Super Bowl played after the completion of the AFL\u2013NFL merger.  Beginning with this game and continuing to the present day, the Super Bowl has served as the NFL's league championship game, with the winner of the AFC Championship Game and the winner of the NFC Championship Game facing off in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.  As per the merger agreement, all 26 AFL and NFL teams were divided into two conferences with 13 teams in each. Along with the Colts, the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to join the ten AFL teams to form the AFC; the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC. This explains why the Colts represented the NFL in Super Bowl III, but the AFC for Super Bowl V. Baltimore advanced to Super Bowl V after posting an 11\u20132\u20131 regular season record. Meanwhile, the Cowboys were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting a 10\u20134 regular season record.\n The game is sometimes called the \"Blunder Bowl,\" \"Blooper Bowl,\" or \"Stupor Bowl\" because it was filled with poor play, a missed PAT, penalties, turnovers, and officiating miscues. The two teams combined for a Super Bowl record 11 turnovers, with five in the fourth quarter. The Colts' seven turnovers remain the most committed by a Super Bowl champion. Dallas also set a Super Bowl record with 10 penalties, costing them 133 yards. It was finally settled when Colts rookie kicker Jim O'Brien made a 32-yard field goal with five seconds left in regulation time. In order to win the game, Baltimore had to overcome a 13\u20136 deficit after three quarters, and losing their starting quarterback Johnny Unitas in the second quarter.

They also remain the only Super Bowl champion to win despite having been shut out in the second half of the game. The game was played on January 14, 1973 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, the second time the Super Bowl was played in that city. At kickoff, the temperature was 84 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C), making the game the warmest Super Bowl.\n This was the Dolphins' second Super Bowl appearance; they had lost Super Bowl VI to Dallas the previous year. The Dolphins posted an undefeated 14\u20130 regular season record before defeating the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs. The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11\u20133 regular-season record and playoff victories over the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys. Despite being undefeated, the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs, largely based on the weakness of their regular-season schedule.\n Super Bowl VII was largely dominated by the Dolphins, and is the second-lowest-scoring Super Bowl to date with a total of only 21 points (three touchdowns and three extra points), second only to the 13\u20133 score of Super Bowl LIII. The only real drama occurred during the final minutes of the game, in what was later known as \"Garo's Gaffe\". Miami attempted to cap their 17\u20130 perfect season with a 17\u20130 shutout by means of a 42-yard field goal by Garo Yepremian, but instead the game and the season was jeopardized when his kick was blocked. Instead of falling on the loose ball, the Dolphins kicker picked it up, attempted a forward pass, but batted it in the air, and Redskins cornerback Mike Bass (who was Garo's former teammate on the Detroit Lions years earlier) caught it and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown. This remains the longest period in a Super Bowl for one team to be shut out, as Washington was held scoreless until 2:07 remained in the fourth quarter.[note 1] Because of the turnover and score, what was a Miami-dominated game became close, and the Dolphins had to stop Washington's final drive for the tying touchdown as time expired. \n Dolphins safety Jake Scott was named Most Valuable Player.

The 49ers defeated the Bengals by the score of 26\u201321 to win their first Super Bowl.\n The game was played on January 24, 1982, at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. It marked the first time that a Super Bowl was held at a cold-weather city. The domed stadium saved the crowd at the game from the very cold and snowy weather, but the weather did affect traffic and other logistical issues related to the game. Super Bowl XVI also became one of the most watched broadcasts in American television history, with more than 85 million viewers, and a final national Nielsen rating of 49.1 (a 73 share).\n For the first time since Super Bowl III, both teams were making their first Super Bowl appearance. The 49ers posted a 13\u20133 regular season record, and playoff wins over the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys. The Bengals finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record, and had postseason victories over the Buffalo Bills and the San Diego Chargers.\n Cincinnati's 356 yards of offense to San Francisco's 275 marked the first time in Super Bowl history that a team which was outgained in total yards won. The Bengals also committed four turnovers to San Francisco's one, which played a major factor in the outcome. Three of Cincinnati's turnovers helped San Francisco build a Super Bowl record 20\u20130 halftime lead, off a touchdown pass and a rushing touchdown from quarterback Joe Montana and two field goals by Ray Wersching. The Bengals began to rally in the second half with quarterback Ken Anderson's 5-yard touchdown run and 4-yard touchdown pass, but a third-quarter goal line stand by the 49ers defense and two more Wersching field goals ultimately decided the game. The Bengals managed to score their final touchdown with 20 seconds left, but could not recover the ensuing onside kick. Montana was named the Super Bowl MVP, completing 14 of 22 passes for 157 yards and one touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Cincinnati tight end Dan Ross recorded a Super Bowl-record 11 receptions (still the most ever by a tight end in a Super Bowl) for 104 yards and 2 touchdowns.",

Super Bowl XX was played on January 26, 1986 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.\n This was the fourth Super Bowl and, to date, the last time in which both teams made their Super Bowl debuts. The Bears entered the game after becoming the second team in NFL history to win 15 regular season games. With their then-revolutionary 46 defense, Chicago led the league in several defensive categories, outscored their opponents with a staggering margin of 456\u2013198, and recorded two postseason shutouts. The Patriots were considered a Cinderella team during the 1985 season, and posted an 11\u20135 regular season record, but entered the playoffs as a wild card because of tiebreakers. But defying the odds, New England posted three road playoff wins to advance to Super Bowl XX.\n In their victory over the Patriots, the Bears set or tied Super Bowl records for sacks (seven), fewest rushing yards allowed (seven), and margin of victory (36 points). At the time, New England broke the record for the quickest lead in Super Bowl history, with Tony Franklin's 36-yard field goal 1:19 into the first quarter after a Chicago fumble. But the Patriots were eventually held to negative yardage (\u221219) throughout the entire first half, and finished with just 123 total yards from scrimmage, the second lowest total yards in Super Bowl history, behind the Minnesota Vikings (119 total yards) in Super Bowl IX. Bears defensive end Richard Dent, who had 1.5 quarterback sacks, forced two fumbles, and blocked a pass, was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP).\n The telecast of the game on NBC was watched by an estimated 92.57 million viewers. To commemorate the 20th Super Bowl, all previous Super Bowl MVPs were honored during the pregame ceremonies.",

He played college football at Brigham Young University, where he was a two-time All-American (1980, 1981) and later in the professional ranks with the Chicago Bears, San Diego Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals, Cleveland Browns, and Green Bay Packers.\n He won two Super Bowl titles, the first with the Bears in Super Bowl XX where he was the starting quarterback, and the second with their rivals, the Green Bay Packers, in Super Bowl XXXI where he was a backup to Brett Favre. Both Super Bowls were against the New England Patriots. McMahon was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1998.",
  "/wiki/1985_Chicago_Bears_season": "The 1985 season was the Chicago Bears' 66th in the National Football League the 16th post-season completed in the NFL, and their fourth under head coach Mike Ditka. \n The Bears entered 1985 looking to improve on their 10\u20136 record from 1984 and advance further than the NFC Championship Game, where they lost to the 15\u20131 San Francisco 49ers. Not only did the Bears improve on that record, but they also put together one of the greatest seasons in NFL history.",
  "/wiki/Tony_Eason": "Charles Carroll \"Tony\" Eason IV (born October 8, 1959) is a former quarterback.  He played college football for the University of Illinois (1980\u20131982) and professional football for the New England Patriots (1983\u20131989) and New York Jets (1989\u20131990).",
  "/wiki/1985_New_England_Patriots_season": "The 1985 New England Patriots season was the franchise's 16th season in the National Football League and 26th overall. The Patriots had a record of eleven wins and five losses and finished tied for second in the AFC East Division. They then became the first team in NFL history ever to advance to the Super Bowl by winning three playoff games on the road, defeating the New York Jets 26\u201314, the Los Angeles Raiders, 27\u201320, and the Miami Dolphins 31\u201314, in the AFC Championship game. The Patriots' win in Miami was their first victory in that stadium since 1966 and while they did defeat Miami on the road in 1969 that game was played in Tampa Bay. The win over the Dolphins in the game has gone down as one of the greatest upsets in NFL history, as the Dolphins were heavily favored. \n But despite the Patriots' success in the playoffs, they proved unable to compete with the acclaimed 15\u20131 Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, losing 10\u201346 in what was at the time the most lopsided defeat in Super Bowl history.  \n \"We couldn't protect the quarterback, and that was my fault.  I couldn't come up with a system to handle the Bears' pass rush,\" head coach Raymond Berry acknowledged.",
