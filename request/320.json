Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity, and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later Great Britain) conquered it, renaming it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations.",

While Germany had finished the 2005 Contest in last place, their position as one of the Contest's \"Big Four\" (along with the United Kingdom, France and Spain) ensured the song an automatic final berth. Thus, it was performed eighth on the night, following Malta's Fabrizio Faniello with \"I Do\" and preceding Denmark's Sidsel Ben Semmane with \"Twist of Love\". At the close of voting, it had received 36 points, placing 14th in a field of 24. Written and composed by Australian-born band member Jane Comerford, the unusual choice of country as the genre resulted in BBC commentator Terry Wogan asking jokingly and with a rough approximation of the appropriate accent \"are we in Athens, Georgia?\" at the end of the performance (the Contest was held in Athens, Greece). Lyrically, the song can be read as a pledge of the singer's undying love for her lover, but Comerford has stated that the chorus at least - \"I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own/Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone/I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone\" - was inspired by her desire to comfort her niece upon the untimely death of her niece's father.
