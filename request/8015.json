The word is derived from the early Italian millione (milione in modern Italian), from mille, thousand, plus the augmentative suffix -one. It is commonly abbreviated as m (not to be confused with the metric prefix for 1\u00d710\u22123) or M and MM (thousand thousands, from Latin Mille; not to be confused with the Roman numeral MM = 2,000), mm, or mn in financial contexts.[better source needed]\n In scientific notation, it is written as 1\u00d7106 or 106. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega (M), when dealing with SI units; for example, 1 megawatt (1 MW) equals 1,000,000 watts.\n The meaning of the word million is common to the short scale and long scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems.\n The million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number, as in Not in a million years and You're one in a million, or a hyperbole, as in I've walked a million miles and You've asked a million-dollar question.",
