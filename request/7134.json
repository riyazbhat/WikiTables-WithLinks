  "/wiki/Kant,_Kyrgyzstan": "Kant is a town in the Chuy Valley of northern Kyrgyzstan, some 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) east of Bishkek.\nIt is the administrative center of the Ysyk-Ata District (formerly Kant District). Kant was established in 1928.\n The Kyrgyz word for sugar is \"kant\", and the city received its name when a sugar plant was built there in the 1930s.  (It is an often repeated myth that the town was named after the German philosopher Immanuel Kant).\n Kant is an industrial and service center. Among notable local enterprises is the Abdysh Ata Brewery, whose products are well known throughout Kyrgyzstan.\nDuring the Soviet era, Kant and its surrounding area were home to a large number of ethnic Germans who had been forcibly relocated to Central Asia in 1941 from the Volga region when the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished. Most left for Germany during the 1990s and after the demise of the Soviet Union when the factories where they had worked shut down.  Several other nearby settlements, such as Luxemburg and Bergtal, still carry their German names, but retain only very small remnants of their Volga German and Russian Mennonite founders.",

Bi\u0161k\u00e9k, IPA:\u00a0[b\u02b2\u026a\u02c8\u0282k\u02b2ek]), formerly Pishpek and Frunze, is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz Republic). Bishkek is also the most commonly  administrative centre of the Chuy Region. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province, but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.\n In 1825 Khokand authorities established the fortress of \"Pishpek\" to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name, \"Pishpek\". It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast.\n In 1925 the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city as Frunze, after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze (1885\u20131925), who was born there. In 1936, the city of Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, during the final stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union. In 1991 the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to \"Bishkek\".\n Bishkek is situated at an altitude of about 800 meters (2,600\u00a0ft), just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of 4,855 meters (15,928\u00a0ft). North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan-Siberia Railway by a spur line.\n Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, watering innumerable trees to provide shade in the hot summers.",

Its population was 14,814 in 2009. It is located along the major Bishkek-Osh route, approximately 3 miles from the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border. The settlement Kochkor-Ata was established in 1952 in regard with discovery and exploitation of Izbaskent oil field. In 2003, it was granted town status.\n The town itself maintains a high level of contrasting polarity.  The center of the town, by the bazaar and municipal buildings, highlights a late Soviet-era style of structural design and color.  Large concrete structures painted in bright colors outline central avenues and plazas.  Soviet propaganda is still framed high on old billboards and posters.  \"Oil is the strength of the people,\" reads one of the central banners.  However, much of Kochkor-Ata is rural.  East of the central plaza past the Soviet-era concrete housing complexes, lie the mainstay of the Kochkor-Ata population.  Small shacks and houses lined closely to each other, stepped along the foothills of the local mountain range, house many of the local inhabitants.  Animal husbandry and small-trade provide many of these villagers with a means of income.\n The town boasts a relatively new clothing bazaar, predominantly built by funds from Kyrgyz ex-president, Askar Akayev, alongside an older established bazaar.\n The bazaar is the center of commerce, in the small town.  It is one of the local stops along the Bishkek-Osh route, and thus maintains a daily flow of inter-and-intra related trade and small commerce.  The avto-vaksal, or bus/taxi station, is also located in the western end of the bazaar.  The local marshrutka, public transport van, runs from the Kochkor-Ata avto-vaksal to other towns along the route, most notably: Massy, Bazar-Korgon, and Jalal-Abad.\n One of the larger oil fields in Kochkor-Ata has been bought out by Chinese business and interests.\n The town has four middle schools: one Russian school, one Kyrgyz boarding school, and two other regular Kyrgyz schools.  The town is also host of a fairly new football stadium, built by funds of a prominent Kyrgyz oil company, KNG, in the town.  A hospital complex has been established adjacent to the Kyrgyz boarding school.",
