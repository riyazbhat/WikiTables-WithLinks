Until late Victorian times it was a distinct village outside London, sitting astride the main road to the north. The area retains many green expanses including the eastern part of Hampstead Heath, three ancient woods, Waterlow Park and the eastern-facing slopes known as Highgate bowl. At its centre is Highgate village, a collection of largely Georgian shops, pubs, restaurants and residential streets, interspersed with diverse landmarks such as St Michael's Church and steeple, St. Joseph's Church and its green copper dome, Highgate School (1565), Jacksons Lane arts centre housed in a Grade II listed former church, the Gatehouse Inn dating from 1670 which houses the theatre Upstairs at the Gatehouse and Berthold Lubetkin's 1930s Highpoint buildings. Highgate also contains the Victorian cemetery in which the Communist philosopher Karl Marx is buried, along with many other notable people. The village is at the top of North Hill which provides views across London: it is 129 metres (423 ft) above sea level at its highest point. The area is divided among three London boroughs: Haringey in the north, Camden in the south and west, and Islington in the south and east. The postal district is N6.",
  "/wiki/Moorgate": "Moorgate is the city centre and central business district of the City of London, and is in central London, it is named after a postern in the London Wall originally built by the Romans. It was turned into a gate in the 15th century. Though the gate was demolished in 1762, the name survives as a major street in the City of London. The street with the same name connects the City to the London Boroughs of Islington and Hackney, and was constructed around 1846 as one of the new approaches to London Bridge. The name Moorgate derives from the surrounding area of Moorfields, which was one of the last pieces of open land in the City. Today the area is a financial centre, and is home to several investment banks. The street also showcases historic and contemporary office buildings. Moorgate station on the London Underground is remembered for the Moorgate tube crash of 1975. In the incident, a train terminating at the station failed to stop and crashed into a brick wall, and 43 people were killed. This resulted in systems being installed on the Underground which automatically stop trains at dead-ends, which have become known as Moorgate control.",

  "/wiki/Asda": "Asda Stores Ltd. (/\u02c8\u00e6zd\u0259/) trading as Asda, is a British supermarket retailer, headquartered in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The company was founded in 1949 when the supermarket owning Asquith family merged with the Associated Dairies company of Yorkshire. It expanded into the south of England during the 1970s and 1980s, and acquired Allied Carpets, 61 large Gateway Supermarkets and other businesses, such as MFI, then sold off its acquisitions during the 1990s to concentrate on the supermarkets. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 1999 when it was acquired by the American retail giant Walmart for \u00a36.7 billion. Asda was the second-largest supermarket chain in Britain between 2003 and 2014 by market share, at which point it fell into third place. Since April 2019, it has regained its second-place position, behind Tesco and ahead of Sainsbury's. Besides its core supermarkets, the company also offers a number of other services, including financial services and a mobile phone provider that uses the existing EE network. Asda's marketing promotions are usually based solely on price, and since 2015, like its parent company, Walmart, Asda has promoted itself under the slogan Save Money. Live Better. Since 1987, Asda has also had its property development subsidiary, McLagan Investments Ltd, which is based at the main Leeds head office site. As a wholly owned division of Walmart, Asda is not required to publish quarterly, half-yearly or full-yearly earnings, but many large UK subsidiaries of US companies submit accounts to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on a voluntary basis. In April 2018, Sainsbury's and Asda announced a merger plan that would have given the combined supermarkets an estimated 30% share of the UK grocery market, however it was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority.",
