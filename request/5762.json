The characters prominently displayed on baggage tags attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used.\n The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by the IATA's headquarters in Montreal. The codes are published semi-annually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory.\n IATA also provides codes for railway stations and for airport handling entities. A list of airports sorted by IATA code is available.
