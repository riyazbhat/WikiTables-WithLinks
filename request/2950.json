The Academy is often referred to as Annapolis, while sports media refer to the Academy as \"Navy\" and the students as \"Midshipmen\"; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering. The list is drawn from graduates, non-graduate former Midshipmen, current Midshipmen, and faculty of the Naval Academy."
