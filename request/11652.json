  "/wiki/List_of_Cleveland_Browns_seasons": "The Cleveland Browns were a charter member club of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) when the league was founded in 1946. From 1946 to 1949, the Browns won each of the league\u2019s four championships. While the National Football League (NFL) does not recognize the Browns\u2019 AAFC championships, the Pro Football Hall of Fame does recognize the team\u2019s championships, which is reflected in this list. When the AAFC folded in 1949, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. The Browns went on to win three NFL championships, nearly dominating the NFL in the 1950s, and won one more NFL championship in 1964. The team has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, however. Overall, the team has won eight championships: four in the AAFC, and four in the NFL.  \n In 1995, then-Browns owner Art Modell made the decision to move the team from Cleveland, Ohio to Baltimore, Maryland. An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team\u2019s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell\u2019s new team would be regarded as an expansion team. The Baltimore Ravens would begin play in 1996, and the Browns would return to the league in 1999. For record-keeping purposes, the Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998, which is reflected in this list. In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became the second team in NFL history to suffer an 0\u201316 record.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Detroit_Lions_seasons": "The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Lions compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit. Originally based in Portsmouth, Ohio and called the Portsmouth Spartans, the team began play in 1928 as an independent professional team. The 2015 season was their 88th in the NFL.\n The Lions have won four NFL championships, tied for 9th overall in total championships amongst all 32 NFL franchises; although the last was in 1957, which gives the club the second-longest NFL championship drought behind the Arizona Cardinals. The Lions were the first franchise to finish a full (non-strike shortened) regular season with no wins or ties since the move to sixteen season games in 1978, going 0\u201316 during the 2008 NFL season. They are also one of four current teams, and the only one in the NFC, to have never played in the Super Bowl.",
  "/wiki/NFC_North": "The National Football Conference \u2013 Northern Division or NFC North  is one of the four divisions of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). Nicknamed the \"Black & Blue Division\" for the rough and tough rivalry games between the teams, it currently has four members: the Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, and Minnesota Vikings. The NFC North was previously known as the NFC Central from 1970 to 2001. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were previously members, from 1977, one year after they joined the league as an expansion team, until 2001 when they moved to the NFC South.\n The division was created in 1967 as the Central Division of the NFL's Western Conference and existed for three seasons before the AFL\u2013NFL merger. After the merger, it was renamed the NFC Central and retained that name until the NFL split into eight divisions in 2002. The four current division teams have been together in the same division or conference since the Vikings joined the league in 1961. The Bears, Lions and Packers have been in the same division or conference since the NFL began a conference format in 1933. Largely because the four teams have played each other at least twice a year, with the exception of the strike-shortened 1982 season, for more than half a century (more than 80 years in the case of the Bears, Lions and Packers), the entire division is considered one very large rivalry.\n The division has a total of 11 Super Bowl appearances. The Packers have the most appearances in the Super Bowl with 5, the most recent happening at the conclusion of the 2010 season. The Bears and the Packers have the only Super Bowl wins of this division, a total of 5 (4 for the Packers and 1 for the Bears). Of the top 10 NFL teams with the highest winning percentage throughout its franchise history, three of them are in the NFC North (the Bears, the Packers, and the Vikings). The Lions however, have one of the lowest winning percentages in the NFL, including the first winless 16-game season in NFL history, in 2008.\n Entering 2018 the Bears led the division with an overall record of 752\u2013581\u201342, victory in Super Bowl XX and eight pre-Super Bowl league titles; Chicago's overall playoff record is 17\u201318. The Packers hold an overall record of 740\u2013564\u201338 with an overall playoff record of 34\u201322, four Super Bowl titles in five Super Bowl appearances, and nine pre-Super Bowl league titles. The Lions hold a record of 555\u2013651\u201332, four league championships, and a 7\u201313 playoff record. As the youngest (in terms of franchise age) team in the division, the Vikings hold a record of 473\u2013392\u201311, a playoff record of 20-29, and had won a league title the season before the merger (although they subsequently lost Super Bowl IV).\n The division earned the moniker \"Black and Blue Division\" due to its intense rivalries and physical style of play, and this nickname is still used regularly today. It is also known as the \"Frostbite Division\" as all teams played home games in late season winter cold until the mid-1970s. The division is also humorously called the \"Frozen North\", although Detroit has played its home games indoors since 1975, and Minnesota also did so from 1982 to 2013 and returned to indoor home games at U.S. Bank Stadium in 2016. ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman often refers to this division as the \"NFC Norris\" because of its geographical similarity to the National Hockey League's former Norris Division.",

The most recent appearance in the Super Bowl by an AFC East team was the Patriots victory in Super Bowl LIII.\n At the end of 2018, the Patriots had the most wins in the division's history, with a record of 500\u2013392\u20139, with a playoff record of 35\u201319 (6\u20135 in Super Bowls) entering the playoffs of that season.

The Jets held a record of 396\u2013480\u20138, with a playoff record of 12\u201313 including a victory in Super Bowl III.\n In 2012, the Patriots broke a tie with the Dolphins for winning the most division titles; with subsequent division titles in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 the Patriots have won 21 AFL/AFC East division titles to Miami's 14.  The Bills have won ten division titles, and the Jets have won four.

The Raiders played their home games at Network Associates Coliseum as members of the AFC West. The Raiders had essentially traded their head coach Jon Gruden following the 2001 season. The Raiders hired Callahan, the offensive coordinator under Gruden to return them to the playoffs. \n Despite their talent, the Raiders struggled in the first half of the season. A 4\u20130 start was followed by four consecutive losses; the team's 4\u20134 record stunned many onlookers. The team, however, redeemed itself by winning seven of its final eight contests. In the third quarter of Oakland's 26\u201320 win on Monday Night Football over the Jets, Tim Brown became the third player in NFL history with 1,000 career catches. Finishing 11\u20135 in a conference where twelve teams obtained .500 or better records and nine were above .500, the Raiders won the AFC West for the third consecutive season and clinched the AFC's top seed and full home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They routed the New York Jets and Tennessee Titans in the playoffs, by a combined score of 71\u201334 and a plus-four in turnover differential; in doing so, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1984. Their opponent was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, led by their former coach Jon Gruden.\n The Raiders entered Super Bowl XXXVII as slight favorites; many predicted a hard-fought showdown between Oakland's top-ranked offense and Tampa Bay's top-ranked defense. The resulting game, however, ended in disaster for the Raiders. An early three-point lead (courtesy of a Sebastian Janikowski field goal) evaporated as the Buccaneers scored 34 unanswered points. The Buccaneers defense, aided by Gruden's knowledge of the Raider offense and Raiders failure to change many of the terms for their offense, intercepted Rich Gannon three times during this scoring surge. Many times, Buccaneer safety John Lynch was able to determine what play was coming based on audibles called by Raider quarterback Rich Gannon. A furious Raider rally cut the score to an almost-competitive 34\u201321 in the fourth quarter. However, two more Gannon interceptions sealed the Raiders' fate in a 21\u201348 bludgeoning.\n The years following the Super Bowl loss marked a period of decline and futility for the Raiders, who would not obtain a winning record nor a playoff trip until 2016, and, as of 2018, have not won another postseason game since this season.",

It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The front office staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.\n The Buccaneers' only Super Bowl championship was won in Super Bowl XXXVII, at the conclusion of the 2002 season. This was the teams' only Super Bowl appearance, having reached the NFC conference championship on two other occasions.

The NFC South currently has four member clubs: the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \n Prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers belonged to the AFC West (1976) and NFC Central (1977\u20132001), while the other three teams were part of the geographically inaccurate NFC West. \n The NFC South is one of two divisions to have each of its teams make a Super Bowl appearance since the 2002 realignment (along with the NFC West): Tampa Bay (2002), Atlanta (2016), Carolina (2003 and 2015) and New Orleans (2009). Also since 2002, each team has won at least three division titles, the only such division in the league. It is also the only NFL division to have zero division sweeps by any of its member teams.\n Entering 2019, the Saints have the most wins among division members.

Each of the other NFC divisions has 3 teams that began play earlier than 1960, while the remaining three such teams are in the American Football Conference.\n The NFC South became the second division in five years to have a champion with a losing record, as the 2014 Carolina Panthers won the division with a 7\u20138\u20131 record. (The 2010 Seattle Seahawks won the NFC West with a 7\u20139 record.) Additionally, Carolina became the first team to repeat as NFC South champions since the creation of the division. The Panthers were the first team to win the NFC South three consecutive times, from 2013 to 2015; New Orleans followed from 2017 to 2019.

Early in this period the Dolphins won their only two Super Bowls in consecutive seasons, in the process achieving the only modern-day perfect season in any major professional sports league during only their third year in the NFL. Much of this success was orchestrated by coach Don Shula who joined the team in 1970 and stayed with them until his retirement in 1995.\n After Shula retired in 1995, the Dolphins remained a force for six years under successors Jimmy Johnson and Dave Wannstedt, but since 2002 and especially since 2004 have fallen on harder times, reaching the postseason only twice in the twelve seasons since, and during the mid-2000s, briefly intensified the Dolphins-Patriots rivalry, when Nick Saban, a former Bill Belichick assistant was hired as the Dolphins head coach in 2005 and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins the following year. In 2007, if not for their overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens, would've suffered an imperfect season, a year before the Detroit Lions became the first team to go winless since the NFL expanded to a 16-game schedule.

The previous record for most improved team one year after a 1\u201315 season belonged to the 1992 Indianapolis Colts, who went 9\u20137.  The 1999 Indianapolis Colts were the only other team to accomplish a 10-game turnaround, winning 13 games after winning 3 in 1998, which was also the first year of the Peyton Manning era. Additionally, Miami won the AFC East, becoming the first team in NFL history to win their division after only having one win the previous season. The division title also snapped the Patriots' 5-year streak of winning the AFC East. Their season would come to an end in the Wild Card round when they were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens, which coincidentally, was also the only team they beat last season in overtime to save the Dolphins from suffering a winless season. With their 11-5 record and division title, the Dolphins had hopes of achieving their first playoff victory since 2000, or to possibly become the first team ever to make the Super Bowl after winning only one game the previous season, similar to how the Carolina Panthers went 1-15 in 2001 and made Super Bowl XXXVIII just two seasons later.\n The 2008 season was the first with Bill Parcells as Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Jeff Ireland as General Manager, and Tony Sparano as head coach.\n With a league-worst 1\u201315 record in 2007, the Dolphins held the first pick in the 2008 NFL Draft and selected Michigan offensive tackle Jake Long. The offseason also saw the departure of two Pro Bowlers and long-time Dolphins with the release of linebacker Zach Thomas and trade of defensive end Jason Taylor.\n The 2008 season was the last season in which the Miami Dolphins had a winning record and qualified for the playoffs before the 2016 team accomplished the feat.\n This season was also notable for the Dolphins wide-spread use of the Wildcat offense. Though previously used by other teams in a several other seasons, this package was fully installed by the Dolphins by week 3, and led to an upset win over the New England Patriots. This marked the last time an undefeated team the season before had lost to a team who went 1-15 the previous season.\n As of 2019, this was the last time the AFC East was won by a team other than the Patriots.",

The first was from 1976 to 1981, when the Broncos did not have a losing season (a season when the team has more losses than wins), and won two AFC West division titles, and one AFC championship. The second began in 1983 and ended in 1998. During this period, the Broncos had just two losing seasons, were AFC champions five times and were Super Bowl champions for two consecutive years.

The team's defensive backfield, arguably the most dominant part of the defense, gave itself the nickname \"No Fly Zone.\"\n The Broncos clinched their fifth-consecutive AFC West division title, fourth consecutive first-round bye and the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed for the third time in four seasons. As was the case during the regular season, the Broncos' defense dominated their playoff opponents. During the Broncos' three playoff games, they recorded 14 sacks, forced seven turnovers, surrendered only one touchdown pass and gave up just 44 combined points (an average of just 14.7 points a game). The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 23\u201316 in the Divisional round and the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots 20\u201318 in the AFC Championship Game. The Broncos then defeated the Carolina Panthers 24\u201310 in Super Bowl 50 \u2014 the franchise's third Super Bowl championship, and the first since winning back-to-back Super Bowls in 1997 and 1998.",

The second period lasted between 1982 and 1991 where the Redskins appeared in the postseason seven times, captured four Conference titles, and won three Super Bowls out of four appearances.\n The Redskins have also experienced failure in their history.  The most notable period of failure was from 1946 to 1970, during which the Redskins did not have a single postseason appearance.

  "/wiki/List_of_NFL_franchise_post-season_droughts": "This is a list of current National Football League (NFL) franchise post-season and Super Bowl droughts (multiple consecutive seasons of not winning). Listed here are both appearance droughts and winning droughts in almost every level of the NFL playoff system.\n As of the 2018 NFL season, every active NFL team has qualified for and won a game in the playoffs. Teams that have never made it beyond each successive milestone are listed under the year in which they began NFL play.\n Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl, four (4) are expansion franchises younger than the Super Bowl itself (Bengals, Panthers, Jaguars, and the Texans). The Falcons began playing during the season in which the Super Bowl was first played. The seven (7) other clubs (Cardinals, Lions, Oilers/Titans, Chargers, Browns, Bills, and Vikings) all won an NFL or AFL championship prior to the AFL\u2013NFL merger; in the case of the Vikings, however, the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their league title, leaving them and the Falcons as the only two teams to have existed for as long as or longer than the Super Bowl that have never secured the highest championship available to them. The longest drought since a championship of any kind is that of the Cardinals, at 72 seasons.\n Note that for continuity purposes, the Cleveland Browns are officially considered to have suspended operations for the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons. Since returning 21 years ago,  they have only made the playoffs once, while the Baltimore Ravens are considered to be a separate team that began play in 1996. The Ravens, as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, absorbed the Browns' personnel upon their suspension, but not their history."
