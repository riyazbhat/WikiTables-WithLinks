The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, one of which is rebounding. Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5\u00a0m).  Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals.\n In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 (1.98 m) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 (2.08 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 (1.83 m) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 (1.91 m). Despite the averages, a variety of players fit \"tweener\" roles which finds them in the small forward or center position depending on matchups and coaching decisions.[citation needed] Some power forwards often play the center position and have the skills, but lack the height that is usually associated with that position.\n Power forwards that are inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Karl Malone, Denise Curry, Dolph Schayes, Kevin McHale, Charles Barkley, Elvin Hayes, Bob Pettit, Dennis Rodman, and Katrina McClain Johnson.",

  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football, a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer (association football). They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game.\n A point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills. Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team, or sometimes for themselves. Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates. This involves setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score, and controlling the tempo of the game. A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets. Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders. A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock, the score, the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams, etc.\n Among the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is Ben Simmons, who at 6\u2019 10\u201d won the 2018 National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year Award. Behind him is Magic Johnson, who at 6\u2019 9\u201d (2.06 m) won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award three times in his career. Other point guards who have been named NBA MVP include Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook, and two-time winners Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. In the NBA, point guards are usually about 6' 4\" (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 1\" (1.85 m) without shoes whereas in the WNBA, point guards are usually 5' 8\" (1.73 m) or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. At 5'3\" the shortest player in NBA history, Muggsy Bogues enjoyed a 14 year career as a point guard. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling. \n After an opponent scores, it's typically the point guard who brings the ball down court to begin an offensive play. Passing skills, ball handling, and court vision are crucial. Speed is important; a speedy point guard is better able to create separation and space off the dribble, giving themselves room to work. Point guards are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. Another major evaluation factor is assist-to-turnover ratio, which reflects the decision-making skills of the player. Still, a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective jump shot.",

Small forwards are typically shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers, but typically taller, larger and stronger than either of the guard positions. \n The small forward is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the five main basketball positions. In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6' 4\" (1.93 m) to 6' 8\" (2.03 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, small forwards are usually between 5' 10\" (1.78 m) to 6' 1\" (1.85 m). \n Small forwards are responsible for scoring points, defending and often as secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center, although a few have considerable passing responsibilities. Many small forwards in professional basketball are prolific scorers.\n The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely. Some players at the position are very accurate shooters, others prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players, and still others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots. In some cases, small forwards position on the baseline or as off-the-ball specialists. Small forwards who are defensive specialists are very versatile as they can often guard multiple positions using their size, speed, and strength.\n Small forwards that are inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Julius Erving, Cheryl Miller, Larry Bird, Sheryl Swoopes, James Worthy, Elgin Baylor, Scottie Pippen, Dominique Wilkins and Rick Barry.",
