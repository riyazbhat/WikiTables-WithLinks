Cear\u00e1 is one of the most traditionally successful clubs in the Northeast region of Brazil alongside Bahia, Santa Cruz, Sport, N\u00e1utico, Vit\u00f3ria and their city rivals Fortaleza.",
  "/wiki/Fortaleza": "Fortaleza ([fo\u0281ta\u02c8lez\u0250], locally [f\u0254\u0266ta\u02c8lez\u0250], Portuguese for Fortress) is the state capital of Cear\u00e1, located in Northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Metropolitan mesoregion of Fortaleza and microregion of Fortaleza. Founded in 1603 as Nova Lisboa (New Lisbon), Fortaleza has grown to Brazil's 5th largest city and the twelfth richest city in the country in GDP and second in the Northeast, with 49 billion reais (US$21 billion). It also has the third richest metropolitan area in the North and Northeast regions. It is an important industrial and commercial center of Brazil, the nation's eighth largest municipality in purchasing power. According to the Ministry of Tourism, the city reached the mark of second most desired destination of Brazil and fourth among Brazilian cities in tourists received. The BR-116, the most important highway of the country, starts in Fortaleza. The municipality is part of the Common Market of Mercosur Cities, and also the Brazilian state capital which is closest to Europe, 5608\u00a0km (3484 miles) from Lisbon, Portugal.\nFortaleza is symptomatic of the wealth divide in Brazil. It ranks 83rd in a measure of wealth disparity. This, and a prevalence of drug trafficking (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Brazil_prison_riots), has contributed to a serious crime problem. Many neighborhoods (barrios) are in fact favelas and not safe, particularly at night. Fortaleza ranks ninth worldwide in intentional murder rate, exceeding the national rate of over 59 per 100,000. While the major tourist attractions are well policed or segregated with security barriers for the well to do, it is evident that the majority of the population lives in defensively equipped homes and that the old time custom of evening sidewalk socializing is disappearing.",
