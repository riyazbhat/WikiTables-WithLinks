References to the creatures recur in texts of Second Temple Judaism, in rabbinical merkabah (\"chariot\") literature, and in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament.",

One of the Dead Sea scrolls (4Q405) construes them as angels; late sections of the Book of Enoch (61:10, 71:7) portray them as a class of celestial beings who (along with the Cherubim and Seraphim) never sleep, but guard the throne of God.\n These \"wheels\" have been associated[by whom?] with Daniel 7:9 (mentioned as galgal, traditionally \"the wheels of galgallin\", in \"fiery flame\" and \"burning fire\") of the four, eye-covered wheels (each composed of two nested wheels), that move next to the winged Cherubim, beneath the throne of God. The four wheels move with the Cherubim because the spirit of the Cherubim is in them. The late Second Book of Enoch (20:1, 21:1) also referred to them as the \"many-eyed ones\".\n The First Book of Enoch (71.7) seems to imply that the Ophanim are equated to the \"Thrones\" in Christianity when it lists them all together, in order: \"...round about were Seraphin, Cherubic, and Ophannin\".",

The term plays a role in subsequent Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The singular \"seraph\" is a back-formation from the Hebrew plural-form \"seraphim\", whereas in Hebrew the singular is \"saraph\".\n Tradition places seraphim in the highest rank in Christian angelology and in the fifth rank of ten in the Jewish angelic hierarchy. A seminal passage in the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1\u20138) used the term to describe six-winged beings that fly around the Throne of God crying \"holy, holy, holy\". This throne scene, with its triple invocation of holiness (a formula that came to be known as the Trisagion), profoundly influenced subsequent theology, literature and art. Its influence is frequently seen in works depicting angels, heaven and apotheosis. Seraphim are mentioned as celestial beings in an influential Hellenistic work, the Book of Enoch, and the Book of Revelation.",

  "/wiki/Elohim": "In the Hebrew Bible, the word elohim (Hebrew: .mw-parser-output .script-hebrew,.mw-parser-output .script-Hebr{font-size:1.15em;font-family:\"SBL Hebrew\",\"SBL BibLit\",\"Frank Ruehl CLM\",\"Taamey Frank CLM\",\"Ezra SIL\",\"Ezra SIL SR\",\"Keter Aram Tsova\",\"Taamey Ashkenaz\",\"Taamey David CLM\",\"Keter YG\",\"Shofar\",\"David CLM\",\"Hadasim CLM\",\"Simple CLM\",\"Nachlieli\",Cardo,Alef,\"Noto Serif Hebrew\",\"Noto Sans Hebrew\",\"David Libre\",David,\"Times New Roman\",Gisha,Arial,FreeSerif,FreeSans}\u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd [\u0294\u025blo\u02d0\u02c8him]) sometimes refers to a single deity, particularly (but not always) the Jewish God, at other times it refers to deities in the plural.\n The word is identical to the usual plural form of the word el, which means gods or magistrates, and it is cognate to the word 'l-h-m which is found in Ugaritic, where it is used as the pantheon for Canaanite gods, the children of El, and conventionally vocalized as \"Elohim\". Most uses of the term Elohim in the later Hebrew text imply a view that is at least monolatrist at the time of writing, and such usage (in the singular), as a proper title for the supreme deity, is generally not considered to be synonymous with the term elohim, \"gods\" (plural, simple noun). Rabbinic scholar Maimonides wrote that the various other usages are commonly understood to be homonyms.\n The notion of divinity underwent radical changes in the early period of Israelite identity and development of Ancient Hebrew religion. The ambiguity of the term elohim is the result of such changes, cast in terms of \"vertical translatability\", i.e. the re-interpretation of the gods of the earliest recalled period as the national god of monolatrism as it emerged in the 7th to 6th century BCE in the Kingdom of Judah and during the Babylonian captivity, and further in terms of monotheism by the emergence of Rabbinical Judaism in the 2nd century CE.",
  "/wiki/Deity": "A deity (/\u02c8di\u02d0\u026ati/ (listen), /\u02c8de\u026a-/ (listen)) or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as \"a god or goddess (in a polytheistic religion)\", or anything revered as divine. C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as \"a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness, beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life\". In the English language, a male deity is referred to as a god, while a female deity is referred to as a goddess.\n Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship. Monotheistic religions accept only one deity (predominantly referred to as God), polytheistic religions accept multiple deities. Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities, considering them as aspects of the same divine principle; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live, die and may be reborn like any other being.:35\u201337:357\u201358\n Although most monotheistic religions traditionally envision their God as omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and eternal, none of these qualities are essential to the definition of a \"deity\" and various cultures conceptualized their deities differently. Monotheistic religions typically refer to God in masculine terms,:96 while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways \u2013 masculine, feminine, androgynous and without gender.\n Historically, many ancient cultures \u2013 including the ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Norsemen\u2013 personified natural phenomena, variously as either deliberate causes or effects. Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts. In Indian religions, deities were envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being's body, as sensory organs and mind. Deities were envisioned as a form of existence (Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) after rebirth, for human beings who gain merit through an ethical life, where they become guardian deities and live blissfully in heaven, but are also subject to death when their merit is lost.:35\u201338:356\u201359",

The numerous depictions of cherubim assign to them many different roles, such as protecting the entrance of the Garden of Eden.\n In Jewish angelic hierarchy, cherubim have the ninth (second-lowest) rank in Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (12th century), and the third rank in Kabbalistic works such as Berit Menuchah (14th century).\nDe Coelesti Hierarchia places them in the highest rank alongside Seraphim and Thrones.\n In the Book of Ezekiel and (at least some) Christian icons, the cherub is depicted as having two pairs of wings, and four faces: that of a lion (representative of all wild animals), an ox (domestic animals), a human (humanity), and an eagle (birds). Their legs were straight, the soles of their feet like the hooves of a bull, gleaming like polished brass.\nLater tradition ascribes to them a variety of physical appearances. Some early midrashic literature conceives of them as non-corporeal.  In Western Christian tradition, cherubim have become associated with the putto (derived from classical Cupid/Eros), resulting in depictions of cherubim as small, plump, winged boys.\n In Islam, the cherubim are the angels closest to God. Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall noted R\u016b\u1e25 as one of the most noble among the cherubim. Others are the Bearers of the Throne or the archangels. In Ismailism, there are seven cherubim, comparable to the Seven Archangels.",
