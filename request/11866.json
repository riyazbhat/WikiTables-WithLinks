As such, they are the oldest professional sports franchise in the city of Vancouver and in the province of British Columbia. They have appeared in the league's Grey Cup championship game 10 times, winning six of those games, with their most recent championship occurring in 2011. The Lions were the first Western Canadian team to have won the Grey Cup at home, having done so in 1994 and 2011, before Saskatchewan won in 2013, while also becoming the only team to beat an American-based franchise in a championship game, a feat accomplished in 1994. The Lions hold the second longest playoff streak in CFL history, making the playoffs every season from the 1997 CFL season to the 2016 CFL season, failing to make the playoffs for the first time in over 20 seasons in 2017 (only the Edmonton Eskimos have had a longer playoff streak; theirs lasted for 34 seasons from 1972 to 2005). With the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Grey Cup win in 2019 after a 29-year wait, the Lions currently have the longest Grey Cup drought of the West Division teams, last winning in 2011.",

They are currently members of the West Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). They play their home games at IG Field after many years of playing at the since demolished Canad Inns Stadium. The Blue Bombers were founded in 1930 as the Winnipeg Football Club, which has always been the organization's legal name. Unlike most other professional teams in the four most popular North American team sports (but much more common in soccer, especially in Europe) the official legal name Winnipeg Football  Club continues to see significant everyday use alongside its nickname, particularly in local media and especially when reporting on the club's business affairs. Another unique aspect to the club compared to other North American professional sports teams (but also more common in Europe) is that it is organized as a corporation without share capital, meaning no one person or entity owns the team - while there are two other community-owned non-profit professional football teams in the CFL and one in the NFL, unlike the Winnipeg Football Club they all have shareholders. Since their establishment, the Blue Bombers have won the league's Grey Cup championship 11 times, most recently in 2019 when they defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33\u201312 in the 107th Grey Cup. The team holds the record for most Grey Cup appearances of any team (25) and were the first club not located in Ontario or Quebec to win a championship.",
