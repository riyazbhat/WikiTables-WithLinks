  "/wiki/RCOR": "In chemistry, a ketone /\u02c8ki\u02d0to\u028an/ is a functional group with the structure RC(=O)R', where R and R' can be a variety of carbon-containing substituents. Ketones and aldehydes are simple compounds that contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond). They are considered simple because they do not have reactive groups like \u2212OH or \u2212Cl attached directly to the carbon atom in the carbonyl group, as in carboxylic acids containing \u2212COOH. Many ketones are known and many are of great importance in industry and in biology. Examples include many sugars (ketoses) and the industrial solvent acetone, which is the smallest ketone."
