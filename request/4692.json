  "/wiki/Cosima_Wagner": "Cosima Wagner (born Francesca Gaetana Cosima Liszt; 24 December 1837 - 1 April 1930) was the illegitimate daughter of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt and Marie d'Agoult. She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works; after his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and philosophy. Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner's later works, particularly Parsifal. In 1857, after a childhood largely spent under the care of her grandmother and with governesses, Cosima married the conductor Hans von B\u00fclow. Although the marriage produced two children, it was largely a loveless union, and in 1863 Cosima began a relationship with Wagner, who was 24 years her senior. She married him in 1870; after his death in 1883 she directed the Bayreuth Festival for more than 20 years, increasing its repertoire to form the Bayreuth canon of ten operas and establishing the festival as a major event in the world of musical theatre. During her directorship, Cosima opposed theatrical innovations and adhered closely to Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was a defining aspect of Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed her death in 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.",
  "/wiki/Faerie_Tale_Theatre": "Faerie Tale Theatre (also known as Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre) is an American live-action fairytale fantasy anthology television series, consisting of 27 episodes, retelling 25 fairy tales, particularly tales by The Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault and Hans Christian Andersen, plus the poem The Pied Piper of Hamelin and a special episode called The Grimm's Party, showcasing the series cast and crew, that originally aired on Showtime from September 11, 1982 until November 14, 1987. Shelley Duvall, who created the series served as host and executive producer of the program alongside Bridget Terry and Fred Fuchs, and occasionally starred in, narrated episodes and also served as a voice artist for the animatronic Nightingale in episode The Nightingale. The series was directed by luminaries such as Francis Ford Coppola, Emile Ardolino and Tim Burton, and would feature numerous Hollywood stars; predominately of the period, in character roles. This was one of the first examples of cable original programming, alongside HBO's Fraggle Rock.

  "/wiki/Queen_(Snow_White)": "The Evil Queen, also called the Wicked Queen, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Snow White, a German fairy tale recorded by the Brothers Grimm; similar stories are also known to exist in other countries. Other versions of the Queen appear in Snow White derivative works, and the character has also become an archetype for unrelated works of fiction. The Evil Queen is Snow White's evil and vindictive stepmother who is obsessed with being the fairest in the land. The beautiful young princess Snow White evokes the Queen's sense of envy, so the Queen designs a number of plans to kill Snow White through the use of witchcraft. A driving force in the story is the Queen's Magic Mirror. In the traditional resolution of the story, the Queen is grotesquely executed for her crimes. The tale is meant as a lesson for young children warning them against the dangers of narcissism, pride, and hubris. Various other versions of the Queen appear in subsequent adaptations and continuations of the fairy tale, including novels and films. In these, the Queen is often re-imagined and sometimes portrayed more sympathetically, such as being morally conflicted or suffering from madness instead of being simply evil. In some of the revisionist stories she has even been portrayed as an antihero or a tragic hero. In some instances, she serves as the protagonist of the story; one such particularly notable version is Disney's, sometimes known as Queen Grimhilde. The Queen has also become an archetype that inspired several characters featured in the works that are not directly based on the original tale.",
