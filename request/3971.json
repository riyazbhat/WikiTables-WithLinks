The important Roman army camp Carnuntum was located only ten miles northeast of Bruck at the Amber Road. In Bruck a Roman  fortification is said to have been at the place of Schloss Prugg (castle of Duke Harrach), of which one part still is named Roman Tower (though being built in the Middle Ages).
