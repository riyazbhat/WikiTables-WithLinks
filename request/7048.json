  "/wiki/Tomorrow's_Pioneers": "Tomorrow's Pioneers (Arabic: \u0631\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u063a\u062f\u200e Ruw\u0101d al-Ghad; also The Pioneers of Tomorrow) is a children's program, broadcast between 2007\u201309 on the Palestinian Hamas-affiliated television station, Al-Aqsa TV (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649\u200e). The show features young host Saraa Barhoum and her co-host, a large costumed animal as they perform skits (or \"scenes\") and discuss life in Palestine in a talk show fashion with call-ins from children (typically of age 9\u201313 with some as young as 3). Presented in a children's educational format similar to such shows as Sesame Street or Barney & Friends, Tomorrow's Pioneers is highly controversial as it contains antisemitism, Islamism,  anti-Americanism, and other anti-Western themes.\n The show, brought to Western attention by pro-Israel organizations such as Palestinian Media Watch and MEMRI, supposedly deals with Islamic traditions and lifestyles, some as innocuous as the importance of drinking milk, and Muslim customs such as performing one's daily prayers, but also advocates messages of Islamism such as \"Resistance Jihad\", and the loathing of Israel, the capitalist economic system, the United States, and western world.\n According to Palestinian Media Watch, two animal character co-hosts, the Mickey Mouse look-alike Farfour and Nahoul the bee were used to \"champion violence, promote hatred of Israel and preach about world Islamic supremacy.\" Later in the show's narrative, the characters were, as the show described it, \"martyred,\" with the deaths either directly or implicitly blamed on \"The Jews, Israel, Israelis, and/or what they believed to be Zionists.\"\n The original host of Tomorrow's Pioneers and Farfour, Hazim Al-Sha'arawi, stated that it was his idea that Farfour be killed by an Israeli interrogator, adding that the show \"wanted to send a message through this character that would fit the reality of Palestinian life.\" El-Sharawi states, \"A child sees his neighbors killed, or blown up on the beach, and how do I explain this to a child that already knows? The [Israeli] occupation is the reason; it creates the reality. I just organize the information for him.\" Al-Aqsa's TV deputy manager stated that the program in fact is simply \"about Palestinian kids express[ing] their feeling[s] regarding what they witness -- if it's [the] occupation it's about that...\"\n The show is considered to be the spiritual successor to an earlier Hamas-broadcast children's radio program series entitled Ovan and Branches (Arabic: \u0623\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0623\u063a\u0635\u0627\u0646\u200e). Broadcast weekly on Fridays and running for 85 minutes, the program is also moderated by Hazim Al-Sha'arawi. Israeli sources have characterized it as \"the 'most serious' of martyrdom operations.\" Arabic sources have said that the broadcasts of Ovan and Branches have been jammed by Israel in the past.",
  "/wiki/Benny_Rabbit": "The Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson, many for the purpose of appearing on the children's television program Sesame Street. Henson's involvement in Sesame Street began when he and Joan Ganz Cooney, one of the creators of the show, met in the summer of 1968, at one of the show's five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \"make do without puppets\".\n Henson was initially reluctant but agreed to join Sesame Street in support of its social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children's Television Workshop (renamed to the Sesame Workshop in 2000), the series' non-profit producer.  The Muppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. The Muppet segments of the show were popular since its premiere, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.\n During the production of Sesame Street's first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969. The results were \"generally very positive\"; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the \"Street\" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.\n The Street scenes were \"the glue\" that \"pulled the show together\", so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. The producers decided to reject the advisers' advice and reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors, specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters. These test episodes were directly responsible for what writer Malcolm Gladwell called \"the essence of Sesame Street\u2014the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults\". Since 2001, the full rights for the Muppets created for Sesame Street have been owned by Sesame Workshop.",
  "/wiki/Sesame_Street": "Sesame Street is an American educational children's television series that combines live action, sketch comedy, animation and puppetry. It is produced by Sesame Workshop (known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) until June 2000) and was created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett. The program is known for its images communicated through the use of Jim Henson's Muppets, and includes short films, with humor and cultural references. The series premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy, and high viewership; it has aired on the U.S.'s national public television provider PBS since its debut, with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16, 2016.\n The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience's viewing habits. With the creation of Sesame Street, producers and writers of a children's television show used, for the first time, educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content. It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied. The show, therefore, has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum.\n Shortly after creating Sesame Street, its producers developed what came to be called the \"CTW model\" (after the production company's previous name), a system of television show planning, production, and evaluation based on collaborations between producers, writers, educators, and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales, and other media. By 2006, there were independently produced versions, or \"co-productions\", of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street, and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.\n Sesame Street was by then the fifteenth-highest-rated children's television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched the series as children. As of 2018, Sesame Street has won 189 Emmy Awards and 11 Grammy Awards, more than any other children's show.",

  "/wiki/Captain_Kangaroo": "Captain Kangaroo was an American children's television series that aired weekday mornings on the American television network CBS from 1955 to 1984, making it the longest-running nationally broadcast children's television program of its day. In 1986, the American Program Service (now American Public Television, Boston) integrated some newly produced segments into reruns of past episodes, distributing the newer version of the series on PBS until 1993.\n The show was conceived by Bob Keeshan, who also played the title character \"Captain Kangaroo\", and who based the show on \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children\". Keeshan had portrayed the original Clarabell the Clown on The Howdy Doody Show when it aired on NBC. Captain Kangaroo had a loose structure, built around life in the \"Treasure House\" where the Captain (the name \"kangaroo\" came from the big pockets in his coat) would tell stories, meet guests, and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets. Keeshan performed as the Captain more than 9,000 times over the nearly 30-year run of the show.\n The May 17, 1971, episode had two major changes on the show: The Treasure House was renovated and renamed \"The Captain's Place\" and the Captain replaced his navy blue coat with a red coat. In September 1981, CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour, briefly retitled it Wake Up with the Captain, and moved it to an earlier time slot; it was moved to weekends in September 1982, and returned to an hour-long format. CBS cancelled Captain Kangaroo at the end of 1984.",
