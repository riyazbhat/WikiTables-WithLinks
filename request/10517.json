  "/wiki/Smilodon": "Smilodon is a genus of the extinct machairodont subfamily of the felids. It is one of the most famous  prehistoric mammals, and the best known saber-toothed cat. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya \u2013 10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842, based on fossils from Brazil. Three species are recognized today: S.\u00a0gracilis, S.\u00a0fatalis, and S.\u00a0populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.\u00a0gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The hundreds of individuals obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils.",
