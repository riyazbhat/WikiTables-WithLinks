  "/wiki/Shun_(band)": "Shun (\u65ec, later known as Syun) was a Japanese experimental sampling unit created by Susumu Hirasawa. The group was active from 1983 to 1987, although it was never officially ended, and was revived by Hirasawa in 1994 to 1996.",
  "/wiki/OOPARTS_(SYUN_album)": "OOPARTS is a compilation album by the Japanese experimental music group Shun, released on DIW Records in 1994. The title of the album references out-of-place artifacts.",
  "/wiki/Compact_Disc": "Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony and released in 1982. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings (CD-DA) but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-i), and Enhanced Music CD. The first commercially available audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700 MiB of data. The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres (2.4 to 3.1 in); they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering device drivers. At the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard drive, which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level.",
  "/wiki/P-Model": "P-Model (also typeset as P-MODEL and P. Model) was a Japanese electronic rock band started in 1979 by frontman Susumu Hirasawa. The band has experienced many lineup revisions over the years but Hirasawa was always at the helm of operations. P-Model officially disbanded in 2000, although many of its members continue to release solo albums and collaborate with each other on different projects.\n Hirasawa has since released work under the name \"Kaku P-Model\", effectively a solo revival of the band.",
  "/wiki/Pause_(P-Model_album)": "Pause is the first live album by P-Model. It was recorded at the final show by the \"defrosted\" lineup. It is part of a pair of conceptual takes on a live album, alongside The Way of Live: On this album, Hirasawa presented the show as an audience member would have heard it, and as such most technical glitches and leaked backstage audio heard at the concert was kept for the release.",
  "/wiki/Demo_(P-MODEL)": "P-Model made a demo in 1979 to obtain a recording contract; it features 2 songs, each one being composed by Susumu Hirasawa and Yasumi Tanaka, P-Model's main songwriters at the time. The band negotiated with 8 record labels, in the end, they chose to sign a contract with Warner-Pioneer, all P-MODEL releases from 1979 to 1981 (3 albums and 3 singles) were handled by Warner-Pioneer, including IN A MODEL ROOM, the album where both of these songs were included. Hirasawa also gave a copy to Plastics keyboardist Masahide Sakuma after a Plastics show after asking him to produce In a Model Room, which Sakuma accepted. Due to the demo nature of the recordings, they are rawer and punkier than the studio recorded versions. The demo was released by Hirasawa's SYUN label in 1994 as a bonus for those who bought both OOPARTS and Pause, the first release of the SYUN label (due to its nature, the demo received a catalogue number outside of the standard numbering convention of the SYUN  label).  The demo was remastered by Hirasawa and re-released on the Ashu-on [Sound Subspecies] in the solar system box set on 10 May 2002; it was put on CD 13, with SCUBA RECYCLE, Air On The Wiring and the In a Model Room outtake WHITE SHOES.",
  "/wiki/Mini_CD_single": "A CD single (sometimes abbreviated to CDS) is a music single in the form of a compact disc. The standard in the Red Book for the term CD single is an 8 cm (3 inch) CD (or Mini CD). It now refers to any single recorded onto a CD of any size, particularly the CD5, or 5-inch CD single. The format was introduced in the mid-1980s but did not gain its place in the market until the early 1990s. With the rise in digital downloads in the early 2010s, sales of CD singles have decreased.\n Commercially released CD singles can vary in length from two songs (an A side and B side, in the tradition of 7\" 45rpm records) up to six songs like an EP. Some contain multiple mixes of one or more songs (known as remixes), in the tradition of 12\" vinyl singles, and in some cases, they may also contain a music video for the single itself as well as a collectible poster. Depending on the nation, there may be limits on the number of songs and total length for sales to count in singles charts.",

  "/wiki/Phnonpenh_Model": "Phnonpenh MODEL is an electronica band created by Hikaru Kotobuki, a former member of P-Model as somewhat of a joke in order to enter a P-Model cover band contest at a club. They continue to regroup from time to time and have released three studio albums and a live CD from their shows in Paris, Berlin and Tokyo. Key members are Hikaru Kotobuki, Lion Merry (ex-Yapoos and Metrofarce) and Masaaki Taniguchi.",
  "/wiki/Desk_Top_Hard_Lock": "Desk Top Hard Lock is the first studio album by Phnonopenh MODEL and the first solo album by Hikaru Kotobuki.

It mixes the electronic sounds used by Kotobuki on the \"Defrosted\" era of P-MODEL with ethnic sounds inspired by his travels through the world and the overall mood is marked by Kotobukii's peculiar sense of humor; it also features some sound alteration that Kotobuki would explore in later releases. After this album was released, Kotobuki sold all his musical instruments and travelled through Asia, which left Phnonpenh MODEL inactive until 1997.",
  "/wiki/SCUBA_(P-MODEL_album)": "Scuba is an album by the Japanese new wave band P-Model.

  "/wiki/VHS": "VHS (short for Video Home System) is a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes. Developed by Victor Company of Japan (JVC) in the early 1970s, it was released in Japan on September 9, 1976, and in the United States on August 23, 1977. [citation needed]\n From the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording became a major contributor to the television industry, via the first commercialized video tape recorders (VTRs). At that time, the expensive devices were used only in professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy). In the 1970s, videotape entered home use, creating the home video industry and changing the economics of the television and movie businesses. The television industry viewed videocassette recorders (VCRs) as having the power to disrupt their business, while television users viewed the VCR as the means to take control of their viewing experience. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a format war in the home video industry. Two of the standards, VHS and Betamax, received the most media exposure.",
  "/wiki/Gramophone_record": "A phonograph record (also known as a gramophone record, especially in British English), often simply record, is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc. At first, the discs were commonly made from shellac; starting in the 1940s polyvinyl chloride became common. In the mid-2000s, gradually, records made of any material began to be called vinyl records, or simply vinyl. The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991.",
  "/wiki/SYUN": "SYUN was a Japanese record label founded by Susumu Hirasawa in 1994. Hirasawa created the label to be able to have freedom to release some of his less commercial works (which later expanded to works by his associates, mostly members of P-MODEL, with most of the albums having Hirasawa involved in some way); the label was named after Syun, Hirasawa's experimental sampler unit, the label's logo is the cover of the Syun album SHUN\u30fb4, which was designed by Quiyoshi Inagaki. Distribution was handled by DIW Records, an independent label owned by the music store chain disk UNION. It released music sparsely, always in a pair of two (although the first release had a bonus third product if one were to order both first and second products; the third release was a similar case, although the bonus offer was two booklets; the sixth release had a bonus P-MODEL product for those who had purchased all 6 previous P-MODEL products), which were sold in record stores and through mail order. Hirasawa's direct releases were mostly material that was created years before it was released (the oldest one being from 1978). The label eventually stopped after Hirasawa/P-MODEL signed with Nippon Columbia and later on formed the Chaos Union company, giving himself more freedom to release what he wants. Hirasawa eventually released the Ashu-on [Sound Subspecies] in the solar system and HALDYN DOME box sets (alongside reissuing the P-MODEL video), reissuing most of the SYUN catalog, with most of the remaining releases being out of print since their release under the SYUN label."
