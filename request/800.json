It is the geographical centre of the region known as West Cork. It is the birthplace of Sam Maguire, an Irish Protestant republican, for whom the trophy of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship is named. There is disagreement over the meaning and origin of the town's name. Various sources list its meaning when translated from Irish as the castle of the yellow river, the castle on the little plain, the fort of the gables (or pinnacles), and the fort of the yellow women. The town centre is built on and around two rivers, each of which are tributaries of the larger River Bandon, which passes by at the east end of the town. The town is twinned with Qu\u00e9ven, France. Dunmanway won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1982.

  "/wiki/Inchigeelagh": "Inchigeelagh (Gaeilge: Inse Geimhleach, meaning Island of the Prisoner or hostages) is a small village, townland and civil parish in County Cork, Ireland. The village is just outside a Gaeltacht area. The River Lee passes through the village. The nearby 'pater noster' string of lakes collectively known as Lough Allua were once popular with anglers and are now fished for large pike, perch and some brown trout. The decline of fishing has coincided with the loss of salmon on the River Lee following the erection of the Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra hydroelectric dams down-river between 1952 and 1957. This led to the subsequent decline in the fortunes of the village as a location for angling. [citation needed] \n A hotel was built in 1810 to serve the horse-drawn coaches of tourists travelling the Prince of Wales route to Kenmare and Killarney. It operated as The Lake Hotel (though it never had a view of the lake) until it closed in 2014. Another hotel was built across the street as Corcoran's Hotel but it became Creedon's Hotel and is now run by the fourth generation of the Creedon family. [citation needed] Recent efforts have been made to campaign for works to be done on the two dams that prevent salmon from accessing the Lee river's upper reaches and a documentary called River Runner has publicised the issues of the river. Inchigeelagh was the meeting place for the Lyre Company Irish Volunteers, in April 1916, from where they intended to collect some of the rifles sent by Roger Casement on board the ship Aud for use in the 1916 Easter Rising. However, the ship was arrested by the British Navy before it could deliver the arms.",
  "/wiki/Ballineen_and_Enniskean": "The twin villages of Ballineen (Irish: B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Fh\u00edn\u00edn, meaning mouth of Fineen's Ford) and Enniskeane (Irish: Inis C\u00e9in, meaning the island of Cian) in County Cork in Ireland are 43 km (26.72 mi) southwest of Cork City, on the R586 road. Ballineen and Enniskean lie on the River Bandon between Bandon and Dunmanway and the fertile Bandon valley. Ballineen belonged first to the Earls of Cork and later to the Earls of Bandon. Lord Bandon improved the village in the mid-19th century by introducing a revival that consisted of building a market house, a courthouse, a Weslyan Chapel, a Gothic Church and two schools in the area. Ballineen held monthly fairs on the streets until the mid-1960s. Enniskean takes its name from Cian Maol Muadh (later O'Mahony) a local chieftain and has a connection with Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland. Cian married S\u00e1bh Brian's daughter and resided at Castlelands, Enniskean. The main employers of the villages are Grainger's Sawmills in Enniskean and Carbery Group's Cheese and Food Ingredients factory located approximately 2 km (1.24 mi) west of Ballineen on the R586 regional road. William Grainger employs many of the local parish in many of his national and international business ventures. The original railway station in Ballineen opened on 12 June 1866. Ballineen and Enniskean railway station opened on 15 May 1891, but finally closed on 1 April 1961. The villages have a Gaelic Athletic Association club called St. Mary's."
