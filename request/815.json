  "/wiki/Blees_Military_Academy": "Blees Military Academy, also known as Still-HiIdreth Osteopathic Sanatorium, is a historic military academy located at Macon, Macon County, Missouri. The academy operated between 1899 and 1907. The old Academic Hall and Gymnasium of Blees Academy were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Blees Military Academy was founded in September 1899 by Colonel Frederick W. V. Blees. Blees was a Prussian immigrant who arrived in Macon in 1889 to take over as headmaster of St. James Academy, an Episcopalian military school for boys. In 1896, Blees inherited his father's coal and iron mining interests in Germany, and he used his newfound wealth to benefit the City of Macon, including building commercial buildings, the town's first theater and sewage system; a local horseless carriage factory, the First National Bank of Macon, and financing the paving of the town's streets. In 1898-1899, Blees took on the project that he hoped would be his legacy - the construction of the Blees Military Academy. Architecturally, Academic Hall and the Gymnasium are a unique expression of the Romanesque Revival style in their rural locale.",
