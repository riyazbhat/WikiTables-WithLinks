The games were held from 24 August to 4 September 1962, in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was the first ever international multi-sport event hosted by the then-17 year old Southeast Asian country. This was the first of two Asian Games hosted by the city as of 2018, the second was held in 2018, with Palembang as the co-host. Israel and the Republic of China (ROC) were excluded from the games. In solidarity with fellow-Muslim majority countries in the Middle East and the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian government refused to issue entry visas for the Israeli and Taiwanese delegations. It was against the rules of the AGF, and Indonesia's own promise to invite all AGF members, including those with whom it had no diplomatic relations; Israel, ROC and the Republic of Korea. The action would make Indonesia suspended from the International Olympic Committee and barred from the 1964 Summer Olympics, which subsequently responded by hosting the Games of the New Emerging Forces in 1963.",
