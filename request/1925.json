The economic revival of the town began in 1875 when a successful mercantile business moved to Holly Springs. Holly Springs then was officially established as a town in 1877, after George Benton Alfred, the owner of the mercantile business, pushed for a town charter. World War I and II did not treat the town well with many young men leaving to fight, leading to population stagnation.
