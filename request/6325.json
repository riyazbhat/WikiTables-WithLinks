  "/wiki/Gu\u00f0mundur_Kamban": "Gu\u00f0mundur Kamban (8 June 1888 \u2013 5 May 1945) was an Icelandic playwright and novelist. He was born near Reykjav\u00edk, son of a merchant of an old and well-known Icelandic family. He graduated from the College of Reykjav\u00edk, where he received honoris causa in literature and language. While still at college, he was made assistant editor of the best known newspaper in Iceland, edited by Bj\u00f6rn J\u00f3nsson. In 1906 his psychic abilities were also investigated by the Experimental Society founded by Einar Hj\u00f6rleifsson Kvaran: as a clairvoyant, he succeeded in divining the contents of closed books, and as an automatic writer he penned works supposedly by Hans Christian Andersen, J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson, and Snorri Sturluson. But he lost his mediumistic abilities after a serious illness. In 1908 he adopted the family name Kamban in place of his birth name (Gu\u00f0mundur J\u00f3nsson) and advocated a change in Icelandic naming conventions. In 1910, he proceeded to the University of Copenhagen, where he specialized in literature and received his master's degree.",

  "/wiki/Arne_Mattsson": "Arne Mattsson (2 December 1919 - 28 June 1995) was a Swedish film director, born in Uppsala. His early movies were mostly comedies. His biggest success was Hon dansade en sommar (1951, aka. One Summer of Happiness), which earned him the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and a nomination for the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. It caused some controversy at the time because it contained nudity. His 1953 film of Peder Sj\u00f6gren's second novel, Bread of Love (K\u00e4rlekens br\u00f6d), based on Sj\u00f6gren's experiences as a volunteer in the Finnish Continuation War of 1941-44 angered the author, was banned in Finland and incurred the wrath of the Soviets at the Cannes Film Festival. In spite of all this, Sj\u00f6gren grudgingly admitted that as a study of men under severe pressure it was impressive. In 1958 he directed Damen i svart, the first in the series of five Hillman-thrillers, centred on Folke Mellvig's crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman.",
