In single player, the player navigates several levels of mazes, destroying creatures with bombs. In multiplayer mode, players defeat each other with bombs. The Mega Drive/Genesis port had some differences, such as fewer options in multi-player, and some different music (for example, Jammin' Jungle's music in the original version was reused as the first level in Super Bomberman 4, but is entirely different in the other version). The original Bomberman '94 was first made available outside Japan in the North American Virtual Console. A port for mobile phones was released in 2008 (renamed Bomberman '08). The previous game, Bomberman '93, was made available instead when Bomberman '94 was released in Japan's Virtual Console.

Power capsules can be collected to give the Soldier Blade access to new weapons, and can even be destroyed to unleash a powerful screen-clearing superweapon. The game is the fourth entry in the Star Soldier series and shares many similarities with its predecessor Super Star Soldier, with Soldier Blade having a heavy emphasis on speed. The initial idea for Soldier Blade came from Hudson designer Uriko Uribo's conversations with other employees over which game to use for the company's upcoming Caravan video game tournament. With the event only six months away, Uribo was hesitant to begin production, however executives from Hudson pushed for him to go forward with the idea. Uribo was simultaneously working on several Game Boy games when development began, giving him less time to focus on the project until these games were completed. The game was originally titled Sonic Blaster F-92, which was changed to Soldier Blade due to trademark issues with another developer. Miscommunication between Uribo and staff lead to several mechanics being altered or changed by mistake, such as several stronger enemies instead being easy to kill. Time and hardware constraints added pressure to the team, leading to several ideas being heavily modified or scrapped entirely. It began development on a 6-megabit HuCard, reduced to a 4-megabit one later on. Although the game was rushed to meet its deadline, Soldier Blade was liked by critics for its gameplay, visuals and power-up system, though some thought it lacked originality and felt inferior to Hudson's previous shooters for the system, namely Blazing Lazers and Final Soldier.",
