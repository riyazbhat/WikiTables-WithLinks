  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d (h\u014dgaku), meaning literally (home) country music (as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d (y\u014dgaku) - Western music) is the folk or traditional music of Japan. Japan's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music, such as Gagaku (court music) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d (Buddhist chanting), but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku, in a broad sense, as the form from which the others were derived. Outside of ethnomusicology, however, H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century. Within this framework, there are three types of traditional music in Japan: theatrical, court music (called gagaku), and instrumental.",
  "/wiki/Biwa": "The biwa (\u7435\u7436) is a Japanese short-necked fretted lute, often used in narrative storytelling. The biwa is the chosen instrument of Benten, goddess of music, eloquence, poetry, and education in Japanese Buddhism.The biwa is a plucked string instrument that was first popular in China and then spread throughout East Asia. It is said to have arrived in Japan from China during the Nara period (710 - 794), and is even thought to have roots that trace back to Persia. It is generally 60 - 106cm in length and made from wood. The instrument consists of a water-drop-shaped body with a handle, and while there are generally four strings, five-stringed varieties also exist. In Japan, the biwa is generally plucked with a bachi instead of the fingers, and is often used to play gagaku. In addition, it is used as musical accompaniment when blind monks recite scriptural texts, or when reciting The Tale of the Heike, a war chronicle from the Kamakura era (1185 - 1333).",
