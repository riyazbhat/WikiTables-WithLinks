  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d (h\u014dgaku), meaning literally (home) country music (as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d (y\u014dgaku) - Western music) is the folk or traditional music of Japan. Japan's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music, such as Gagaku (court music) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d (Buddhist chanting), but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku, in a broad sense, as the form from which the others were derived. Outside of ethnomusicology, however, H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century. Within this framework, there are three types of traditional music in Japan: theatrical, court music (called gagaku), and instrumental.",
  "/wiki/Biwa": "The biwa (\u7435\u7436) is a Japanese short-necked fretted lute, often used in narrative storytelling. The biwa is the chosen instrument of Benten, goddess of music, eloquence, poetry, and education in Japanese Buddhism.The biwa is a plucked string instrument that was first popular in China and then spread throughout East Asia. It is said to have arrived in Japan from China during the Nara period (710 - 794), and is even thought to have roots that trace back to Persia. It is generally 60 - 106cm in length and made from wood. The instrument consists of a water-drop-shaped body with a handle, and while there are generally four strings, five-stringed varieties also exist. In Japan, the biwa is generally plucked with a bachi instead of the fingers, and is often used to play gagaku. In addition, it is used as musical accompaniment when blind monks recite scriptural texts, or when reciting The Tale of the Heike, a war chronicle from the Kamakura era (1185 - 1333).\n The origin of the biwa is the Chinese pipa. It arrived in Japan in two forms. Since that time, the number of biwa types has more than quadrupled. Guilds supporting biwa players, particularly the biwa hoshi, helped proliferate biwa musical development for hundreds of years. Biwa h\u014dshi performances overlapped with performances by other biwa players many years before heikyoko and continues to this day. This overlap resulted in a rapid evolution of the biwa and its usage and made it one of the most popular instruments in Japan.\n Yet, in spite of its popularity, the \u014cnin War and subsequent Warring States Period disrupted biwa teaching and decreased the number of proficient users. With the abolition of Todo in the Meiji period, biwa players lost their patronage.\n Furthermore, reforms stemming from the Meiji Restoration led to massive, rapid industrialization and modernization. Japan modeled its development on Europe and the US, praising everything Western and condemning everything native.[citation needed] Traditions identifiably Japanese became associated with terms like backwards or primitive.[citation needed] Such associations even extended into areas like art and music, and the biwa.[citation needed]\n By the late 1940s, the biwa, a thoroughly Japanese tradition, was nearly completely abandoned for Western instruments; however, thanks to collaborative efforts by Japanese musicians, interest in the biwa is being revived. Japanese and foreign musicians alike have begun embracing traditional Japanese instruments, particularly the biwa, in their compositions. While blind biwa singers no longer dominate the biwa, many performers continue to use the instrument in traditional and modern ways.",
  "/wiki/Shakuhachi": "The shakuhachi (Japanese: \u5c3a\u516b\u3001\u3057\u3083\u304f\u306f\u3061, pronounced [\u02cc\u0283ak\u028a\u02c8hat\u0283i]) (Chinese: \u5c3a\u516b; pinyin: ch\u01d0b\u0101) is a Japanese and ancient Chinese longitudinal, end-blown bamboo-flute.\n It was originally introduced from China into Japan in the 7th century and reached its peak in the Edo period. (17th\u201318th century). The oldest shakuhachi in Japan is currently stored in Sh\u014ds\u014d-in, Nara. The shakuhachi introduced into Japan changed its form and scale many times after that, and the present shakuhachi was completed in the Edo period in the 17th century. The shakuhachi is traditionally made of bamboo, but versions now exist in ABS and hardwoods. It was used by the monks of the Fuke sect of Zen Buddhism in the practice of suizen (\u5439\u7985, blowing meditation).\n The instrument is tuned to the minor pentatonic scale.",

  "/wiki/Shamisen": "The shamisen or samisen (\u4e09\u5473\u7dda), also sangen (\u4e09\u7d43, both words mean \"three strings\"), is a three-stringed traditional Japanese musical instrument derived from the Chinese instrument sanxian. It is played with a plectrum called a bachi.\n The Japanese pronunciation is usually shamisen but sometimes jamisen when used as a suffix, according to regular sound change (e.g. tsugaru-jamisen). It is samisen in western Japan and in several Edo-period sources.\n The construction of the shamisen varies in shape, depending on the genre in which it is used. The instrument used to accompany kabuki has a thin neck, facilitating the agile and virtuosic requirements of that genre. The one used to accompany puppet plays and folk songs has a longer and thicker neck instead, to match the more robust music of those genres.",
  "/wiki/Nagauta": "Nagauta (\u9577\u5504), literally \"long song\", is a kind of traditional Japanese music which accompanies the kabuki theater.  It was developed around 1740.

Nagauta performers generally play the shamisen and sing simultaneously.\n Nagauta is the basis of the Nagauta Symphony, a symphony in one movement composed in 1934 by composer Kosaku Yamada.\n Meriyasu is considered a subset of nagauta.",
