Ab Band is on the main road from Kabul to Kandahar. Ab Band is divided into two parts, North and South Aband. Between the two is a desert and a river which flows to the south into a lake. Much of Ab Band villages are now under Taliban control; only the district headquarters is under government control. Ab Band has no construction projects; its local people regularly go to Pakistan and Iran for work. There are four famous ethnic groups settled in Ab Band: Buden Khail, Na Khail, Mul Khail and Sorkhail. Ab Band is popular for its tasty grapes and resins that are usually exported to Ghazni city and Muqur district for trade and exchange for goods. There is also a small bazaar (town) for locals to purchase daily needs and meet neighbor villagers. The bazaar is between Bazi and Chawnai villages. Ab Band people are really poor; they struggle and work at agriculture fields for over 6 months to afford only the harsh winter.",

They primarily live in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A substantial majority of ethnic Pashtuns share Pashto - an Eastern Iranic language in the Indo-European language family - as the native language. Globally, the Pashtuns are estimated to number around 50 million, but an accurate count remains elusive due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979. The majority of the Pashtuns live in the region regarded as Pashtunistan, which has been split between two countries since the Durand Line border was formed after the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The Pashtuns are a significant minority group in Pakistan, where they constitute the second-largest ethnic group or about 15 percent of the population. Smaller, but still significant Pashtun diaspora communities exist in Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan, especially in the cities of Karachi and Lahore, and in the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, India. A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, primarily in the United Arab Emirates. As the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan (anywhere between 42 and 60 percent of the population), Pashtuns have been the dominant ethno-linguistic group for over 300 years. During the Delhi Sultanate era, the 15th-16th century Lodi dynasty briefly replaced the preexisting rulers in North India until Babur completely deposed the Lodi dynasty. Other Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century, which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the Great Game from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires.",

During the pre-Islamic period, the area was inhabited by various tribes who practiced different religions including Buddhism and Hinduism.

In Afghanistan, the Pamiris are counted as a separate ethnic group. As a self-designation, the literary New Persian term Tajik, which originally had some previous pejorative usage as a label for eastern Persians or Iranians, has become acceptable during the last several decades, particularly as a result of Soviet administration in Central Asia.
