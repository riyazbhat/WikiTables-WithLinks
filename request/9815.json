  "/wiki/High_Incident": "High Incident is a police drama series produced by DreamWorks Television for the ABC network. The show was created by Steven Spielberg, Michael Pavone, Eric Bogosian, and Dave Alan Johnson. It first aired on March 4, 1996, running a total of 32 episodes.  The title of the series itself is a misnomer; in common Southern California (particularly LAPD) law enforcement radio practices, calls are dispatched with a response code, generally Code 2 (non-emergency response) or Code 3 (emergency \"lights and siren\" response).  A \"Code 2 High\" response would generally mean the officers are to respond immediately, but not necessarily with lights and siren.  LAPD radio traffic of the period also had the \"incident number\" broadcast when the call was dispatched, so a domestic dispute might be dispatched \"Code 2 High, incident 1234\".  The words \"high\" and \"incident\" never being intended to go together and the phrase \"high incident\" having no meaning.",
