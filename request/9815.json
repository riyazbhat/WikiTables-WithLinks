  "/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company": "The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American commercial broadcast radio and television network owned by the Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company. The network is headquartered in Burbank, California, on Riverside Drive, directly across the street from Walt Disney Studios and adjacent to the Roy E. Disney Animation Building.

It is the fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the Big Three television networks. ABC is nicknamed \"The Alphabet Network\", as its initialism also represents the first three letters of the English alphabet, in order. ABC launched as a radio network on October 12, 1943, serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC.",
  "/wiki/High_Incident": "High Incident is a police drama series produced by DreamWorks Television for the ABC network. The show was created by Steven Spielberg, Michael Pavone, Eric Bogosian, and Dave Alan Johnson. It first aired on March 4, 1996, running a total of 32 episodes.  The title of the series itself is a misnomer; in common Southern California (particularly LAPD) law enforcement radio practices, calls are dispatched with a response code, generally Code 2 (non-emergency response) or Code 3 (emergency \"lights and siren\" response).  A \"Code 2 High\" response would generally mean the officers are to respond immediately, but not necessarily with lights and siren.  LAPD radio traffic of the period also had the \"incident number\" broadcast when the call was dispatched, so a domestic dispute might be dispatched \"Code 2 High, incident 1234\".  The words \"high\" and \"incident\" never being intended to go together and the phrase \"high incident\" having no meaning.",
