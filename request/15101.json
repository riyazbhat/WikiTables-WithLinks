  "/wiki/ESP-Disk": "ESP-Disk is a New York-based record company and label founded in 1964 by lawyer Bernard Stollman. Though it originally existed to release Esperanto-based music, starting with its second release (Albert Ayler's Spiritual Unity), ESP became the most important exponent of what is commonly referred to as free jazz. ESP also released recordings by uncommercial underground rock acts including the Fugs, The Godz and Pearls Before Swine. Bernard Stollman faced allegations of not paying royalties to the artists that were signed to ESP-Disk. Tom Rapp of the band Pearls Before Swine claimed that \"We never got any money from ESP. Never, not even like a hundred dollars or something. My real sense is that he [Stollman] was abducted by aliens, and when he was probed it erased his memory of where all the money was\". Peter Stampfel of the band Holy Modal Rounders and The Fugs claimed that Stollman told him that \"the contract says that all rights belong to me.",

A member of John Coltrane's groups of the mid-1960s, Sanders is known for his overblowing, harmonic, and multiphonic techniques on the saxophone, as well as his use of \"sheets of sound\". He has released over 30 albums as a leader and has collaborated extensively with Leon Thomas, Alice Coltrane and Tisziji Mu\u00f1oz, among others. Saxophonist Ornette Coleman described him as \"probably the best tenor player in the world\". \n Sanders' music has been called \"spiritual jazz\" due his inspiration in religious concepts such as Karma and Tawhid, and his rich, meditative aesthetic. This style is seen as a continuation of Coltrane's work on albums such as A Love Supreme. As a result, Sanders is considered a disciple of Coltrane or, as Albert Ayler said, \"Trane was the Father, Pharoah was the Son, I am the Holy Ghost\"."
