  "/wiki/Nagasaki": "Nagasaki (Japanese: \u9577\u5d0e, Long Cape) is the capital and the largest city of Nagasaki Prefecture on the island of Kyushu in Japan. It became the sole port used for trade with the Portuguese and Dutch during the 16th through 19th centuries and the Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region have been recognized and included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Part of Nagasaki was home to a major Imperial Japanese Navy base during the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War.\n During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack (at 11:02 am, August 9, 1945 'Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)').\n As of 1 June 2019[update], the city has an estimated population of 412,643 and a population density of 1,017 people per km\u00b2. The total area is 405.86 km2 (156.70 sq mi).",
  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers, creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs. It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century. If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered, and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect. The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany. Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast. The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber. Hewing this with broadaxes, adzes, and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers (brace and bit) and other woodworking tools, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed.",
  "/wiki/Brick": "A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks can be joined together using mortar, adhesives or by interlocking them. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks. Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from expanded clay aggregate. Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC.",
  "/wiki/Shinkamigot\u014d,_Nagasaki": "Shin-Kamigot\u014d (\u65b0\u4e0a\u4e94\u5cf6\u753a, Shin-Kamigot\u014d-ch\u014d) is a town located in Minami-Matsuura District, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. The town was established on August 1, 2004 after the merger of the towns of Arikawa, Kamigot\u014d, Narao, Shin-Uonome and Wakamatsu, all from Minami-Matsuura District. It occupies the two main islands of Nakad\u014dri and Wakamatsu, which are connected by Wakamatsu Oohashi (Wakamatsu Great Bridge) via the small, unpopulated islet of Kaminakajima (\u4e0a\u4e2d\u5cf6), as well as several smaller islands, including the populated islands of Arifuku, Hinoshima, Ry\u014dzegaura, Kashiragashima, and Kirinoko. Wakamatsu Island is connected at its northwestern extremity to Ry\u014dzegaura Island by the Ry\u014dzegaura Bridge, and Ry\u014dzegaura Island is further linked with the islands of Arifuku and Hinoshima by breakwaters that allow traffic of automobiles. Kashiragashima Oohashi connects the eastern end of the main island of Nakad\u014dri with Kashiragashima, on which the famous Kashiragashima Church and the defunct Kamigot\u014d Airport are located. The islands that comprise the territory of Shin-Kamigot\u014d Town also form the northeastern half of the Got\u014d Islands archipelago, which is the origin of the name Kamigot\u014d (literally, Upper Five Islands), in which Got\u014d (Five Islands) is the name of the entire archipelago, and Kami- (Upper) refers to the fact that this half of the archipelago is located closer to the Japanese capital relative to the southwestern half. The prefix Shin- (\u65b0) at the beginning of the town's name means new, so its full name may be translated literally to English as New Upper Five Islands Town, though the name may be interpreted to refer to the town as a new and expanded version of the former Kamigot\u014d Town, which was centered on the port of Aokata on the western side of the middle of Nakad\u014dri Island. As of March 31, 2017, the town has an estimated population of 19,866 and a density of 93 persons per km2.",

  "/wiki/Wood": "Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an organic material \u2013 a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. [citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate.",

  "/wiki/Twenty-six_Martyrs_of_Japan": "The Twenty-Six Martyrs of Japan (\u65e5\u672c\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u8056\u4eba, Nihon Nij\u016broku Seijin) were a group of Catholics who were executed by crucifixion on February 5, 1597, at Nagasaki.  Their martyrdom is especially significant in the history of the Catholic Church in Japan.\n A promising beginning to Catholic missions in Japan \u2013 with perhaps as many as 300,000 Catholics by the end of the 16th century \u2013 met complications from competition between the missionary groups, political difficulty between Spain and Portugal, and factions within the government of Japan.  Christianity was suppressed, and it was during this time that the 26 martyrs were executed.  By 1630, Catholicism had been driven underground. When Christian missionaries returned to Japan 250 years later, they found a community of hidden Catholics that had survived underground.",

  "/wiki/Reinforced_concrete": "Reinforced concrete (RC) (also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (concrete in compression, reinforcement in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning.\n For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least:",

The Nagasaki churches are unique in the sense that each tells a story about the revival of Christianity after a long period of official suppression.\n Proposed jointly in 2007 for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List under criteria ii, iii, iv, v, and vi, the submission named at the time Churches and Christian Sites in Nagasaki on the Tentative List, was recognized on January 30, 2018, as a World Heritage Site. \n The initial nomination included 26 sites; however, after reconsideration the Nagasaki Prefecture reduced the monuments to 13 sites. Twelve sites were recognized. Concerns over the Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region have been widely discussed in the academic literature."
