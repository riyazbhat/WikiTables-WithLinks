  "/wiki/Post_town": "A post town is a required part of all postal addresses in the United Kingdom and Ireland,  and a basic unit of the postal delivery system.

  "/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom": "Postal codes used in the United Kingdom are known as postcodes (originally, postal codes). They are alphanumeric and were adopted nationally between 11 October 1959 and 1974, having been devised by the General Post Office (Royal Mail). A full postcode is known as a postcode unit and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point. The structure of a postcode is two alphanumeric codes, the first having between two and four characters and the second, three characters. First, one or two letters indicate the postcode area, followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area. This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district, and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street. Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city (such as B for Birmingham) but may also be geographic in nature (such as HS for Outer Hebrides). Each postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one (or more) postcode districts.",
