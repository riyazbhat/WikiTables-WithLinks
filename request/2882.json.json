  "/wiki/Sankofa_(1993_film)": "Sankofa is a 1993 Burkinese drama film directed by Haile Gerima centered on the Atlantic slave trade. The storyline features Oyafunmike Ogunlano, Kofi Ghanaba, Mutabaruka, Alexandra Duah, and Afemo Omilami. The word Sankofa derives its meaning from the Ghanaian Akan language which means to \"go back, look for, and gain wisdom, power and hope,\" according to Dr. Anna Julia Cooper. The word Sankofa stresses the importance of one not drifting too far away from one's past in order to progress in the future. In the film, Sankofa is depicted by a bird and the chants and drumming of a Divine Drummer. Gerima's film showed the importance of not having people of African descent drift far away from their African roots. Gerima used the journey of the character Mona to show how the African perception of identity included recognizing one's roots and \"returning to one\u2019s source\" (Gerima).",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television, drama is a genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone. Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre, such as \"police crime drama\", \"political drama\", \"legal drama\", \"historical period drama\", \"domestic drama\", \"teen drama\" or \"comedy-drama\". These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods.",
  "/wiki/Emmanuel%27s_Gift": "Filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern capture Emmanuel Yeboah\u2019s heart, spirit, and determination through the 2005 documentary Emmanuel\u2019s Gift, based on the true story of Emmanuel\u2019s life solely dedicated to making change. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the documentary follows Emmanuel on his journey to change the political and societal norms wrapped around disabled people in his home country of Ghana. Being that he was born with a deformed right leg, Emmanuel witnessed firsthand his whole life how disabled people were treated and viewed in the eyes of society. Children born with disabilities in Ghana are often abandoned or, in more extreme cases, killed. If they do survive, they often become poor beggars on the street. He, on the other hand, grew up in a small home with his mother and family. His father abandoned his mother when he found out that his son had a deformed leg. Emmanuel shined shoes every day for $2, refusing to let the prejudices against disabled people get to his head. One day he put in a grant request to the Challenged Athletes Foundation based in California all the way over in the United States. His request was not one for money, but rather for a bike that he would later receive to travel nearly 380 miles across the entire country of Ghana on to show those that did not support equal rights that disabled people can accomplish above and beyond what society tells them they can.\nWord spread fast about Emmanuel\u2019s long journey on the bike given to him by the foundation. The Challenged Athletes Foundation, who gave Emmanuel the bicycle, reached out and asked him to come to America to do their triathlon. Being the ultimate go getter, Emmanuel went along and was even given a prosthetic leg after due time. Being as selfless as he is, Emmanuel used his newly found fame to better the 2 million disabled people of Ghana. He was awarded the CAF Most Inspirational Athlete of the Year Award and Nike\u2019s Casey Martin award in America. Along with these awards he was also gifted money, and he used it all to give the people of Ghana free wheelchairs, and started the Emmanuel Education Fund. Hearing about his son\u2019s fame, Emmanuel\u2019s father returned to him to make amends. Emmanuel clarifies in the documentary that he doesn\u2019t buy the excuses his father stresses, but gifts his father with his forgiveness anyway. The documentary wraps up by showing many promising changes Emmanuel has made to Ghana and plans to make in the future.",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence, extended fighting, physical feats, and frantic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero (though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead). Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past. However, reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed, as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic, highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism. While action has long been a recurring component in films, the \"action film\" genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects. Common action scenes in films are generally, but not limited to, explosions, car chases, fistfights, and shootouts.",
