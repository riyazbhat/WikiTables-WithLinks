Roda JC Kerkrade plays in the Eerste Divisie. The club was founded by a merger between Rapid JC and Roda Sport in 1962. They were placed in the Eerste Divisie, and after a relegation they were promoted back to the top division in 1973, where they would stay for 41 years until being relegated in 2014. In 2009\u201310, they added Kerkrade to the name to create brand awareness and get financial support.

However, in Kerkrade and the surrounding area, they are said with pride and respect. The last Dutch coal mines were closed in the 1970s, but the southeastern part of the Netherlands' most southern province, Limburg, is still referred to as the Mijnstreek (mine district) today.",
