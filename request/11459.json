  "/wiki/Districts_of_Bhutan": "The Kingdom of Bhutan is divided into 20 districts (Dzongkha: dzongkhags). Bhutan is located between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and India on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas in South Asia.\nDzongkhags are the primary subdivisions of Bhutan.  They possess a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of Bhutan, such as regulating commerce, running elections, and creating local governments. The Local Government Act of 2009 established local governments in each of the 20 dzongkhags overseen by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs. Each dzongkhag has its own elected government with non-legislative executive powers, called a dzongkhag tshogdu (district council). The dzongkhag tshogdu is assisted by the dzongkhag administration headed by a dzongkdag (royal appointees who are the chief executive officer of each dzongkhag). Each dzongkhag also has a dzongkhag court presided over by a dzongkhag drangpon (judge), who is appointed by the Chief Justice of Bhutan on the advice of Royal Judicial Service Council. The dzongkhags, and their residents, are represented in the Parliament of Bhutan, a bicameral legislature consisting of the National Council and the National Assembly. Each dzongkhag has one National Council representative. National Assembly representatives are distributed among the dzongkhags in proportion to their registered voter population as recommended by the Delimitation Commission, provided that \"no dzongkhag shall have less than two and more than seven National Assembly constituencies.\"\n As of the 2017 census, Thimphu is the most populous dzongkhag, with 138,736 residents; Gasa is the least populous with 3,952 residents.  Thimphu is the most densely populated with 67.1 people per km2 whereas Gasa is the least densely populated with 1.3 people per km2. The largest dzongkhag by land area is Wangdue Phodrang encompassing 4,308\u00a0km2, while the smallest is Tsirang, encompassing 639\u00a0km2.",
  "/wiki/Gewog": "A gewog (Dzongkha: \u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f42 geok, block), in the past also spelled as geog, refers to a group of villages in Bhutan. The head of a gewog is called a gup (\u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0b gepo). Gewogs form a geographic administrative unit below dzongkhag districts (and dungkhag subdistricts, where they exist), and above Dzongkhag Thromde class B and Yenlag Thromde municipalities. Dzongkhag Thromde class A municipalities have their own independent local government body.\n Bhutan comprises 205 gewogs, which average 230\u00a0km\u00b2 in area. The gewogs in turn are divided into chewogs for elections and thromdes \"municipalities\" for administration. The Parliament of Bhutan passed legislation in 2002 and 2007 on the status, structure, and leadership of local governments, including gewogs. The most recent legislation by parliament regarding gewogs is the Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009. In July 2011, the government slated 11 gewogs across Bhutan for reorganization, including both mergers and bifurcations, to be debated in dzongkhag local governments. These changes are contemplated to promote ease of travel to gewog capitals and to equitably allocate development resources.",

Archery was declared the national sport in 1971, when Bhutan became a member of the United Nations. Since then, the popularity of Bhutanese archery has increased both inside and outside Bhutan, with a measure of government promotion. Bhutan also maintains an Olympic archery team. Previously, competitions were held only at dzongkhag and gewog levels, however modernly, archery tournaments and competitions are held throughout the country. Archery is played during religious and secular public holidays in Bhutan, local festivals (tsechu), between public ministries and departments, and between the dzonkhag and the regional teams. Archery tournaments and performances have also become a significant point of interest for tourism in Bhutan.\n Archery in Bhutan is culturally distinctive because it is a martial art practiced among a modern population that abhors killing. Bhutanese people from different social strata find archery one of the most enjoyable sports, being both fun and physical exercise. In addition, archery builds concentration, which contributes to mental development; according to a Bhutanese proverb, both sailing and archery require intelligence. Archery in Bhutan is a way of socialization, communication, and development of relations between people. Emotions run high during competitions, and support for archers and ridicule or distraction of opponents can become as violent as in other countries' sporting events.",

The river rises in Wangdue Phodrang district (or dzongkhag in Dzongkha), near Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan's highest peak at 7,546 metres (24,757\u00a0ft).   Bhutan's main east-west highway crosses the Mangde Chhu about 8 kilometres (5\u00a0mi) west of Trongsa. South of Trongsa, the river drains the eastern slopes of the Black Mountains (Bhutan), and forms the eastern boundaries of Black Mountain National Park and Royal Manas National Park.  Another highway follows the river south from Trongsa to Shemgang.  The highway leaves the river at Tingtinbi, and eventually reaches the Indian border at Gelegphug.  South of Tingtinbi, the Mangde is joined by the Bumthang River from the east, and is known as the Tongasa.  Shortly before entering India in Assam, the Manas River flows into the river from the east, and the river exits Bhutan near Manas.\n Important towns and areas through which the Trongsa - Gelegphug road passes are Shemgang (Shamgong), Taama, Bataase, and Surey rice fields. The road and bridges were built by the Indian Border Roads Organisation. Among the number of bridges built across this river, two are noteworthy. They are the Bailey suspension bridges of about 110-metre (360\u00a0ft) span, one near Hathisar and the other at Tama built between 1963 and 1965.
