  "/wiki/Hairy-eared_dwarf_lemur": "The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis), or hairy-eared mouse lemur, is one of the most scarcely known lemurs. A. trichotis is a nocturnal lemur that is endemic to Madagascar. It was originally named by Dr. Albert G\u00fcnther in 1875 as Cheirogaleus trichotis as part of the Cheirogaleidae family, or the dwarf lemurs. However, in 1967 Petter-Rousseaux and Petter reassigned the  lemur to its own genus and is the now only member of the genus Allocebus.  The hairy-eared dwarf lemur was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1989 in a northeastern primary lowland rainforest. The population of these mammals is shown to be severely decreasing and largely fragmented throughout Northern and Eastern Madagascar rainforests; most likely due to hunting, trapping, slash-and-burn agriculture as well as habitat fragmentation.",

  "/wiki/Groves%27_dwarf_lemur": "Groves' dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus grovesi) is a species of dwarf lemur known from Ranomafana and Andringitra national parks and surrounding areas in southeastern Madagascar.  The identification was based on comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences with other members of the C. crossleyi group (C. andysabini, C. crossleyi, C. lavasoensis and an unnamed possible new species, \"CCS2\"). Individuals from this clade first came under genetic study in 1999 and were recognized as a new species in 2014, but it was not formally described until 2017.  The lemur was named after mammalologist Colin Groves. Known from altitudes from 754 to 999 m, it is significantly larger than other members of the C. crossleyi group, with a 20 cm body length, a 29 cm tail, and a weight of 0.41 kg. While the conservation status of the new species has not yet been assessed, its presence in several national parks does not guarantee that it will not be threatened by deforestation ongoing on the island, or possibly by hunting.",

Fewer than 50\u00a0individuals are thought to exist.  Its habitat lies in a transitional zone between three ecoregions: dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest, and humid forest.  First collected in 2001 and thought to be a subpopulation of the furry-eared dwarf lemur (C.\u00a0crossleyi), it was not formally described until 2013.
