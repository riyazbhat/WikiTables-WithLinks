It is the only state located in the Pacific Ocean and the only state composed entirely of islands. The state encompasses nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 islands spread over 1,500 miles (2,400 km). The volcanic archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight main islands are, in order from northwest to southeast: Ni\u02bbihau, Kaua\u02bbi, O\u02bbahu, Moloka\u02bbi, L\u0101na\u02bbi, Kaho\u02bbolawe, Maui, and Hawai\u02bbi. The last is the largest island in the group; it is often called the Big Island or Hawai\u02bbi Island to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. Hawai\u02bbi is the 8th-smallest geographically and the 11th-least populous, but the 13th-most densely populated of the 50 states. It is the only state with an Asian American plurality.",
