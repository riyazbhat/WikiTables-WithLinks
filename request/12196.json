  "/wiki/RA-5C": "The North American A-5 Vigilante was an American carrier-based supersonic bomber designed and built by North American Aviation for the United States Navy. It set several world records, including long-distance speed and altitude records. Until the 1962  unification of Navy and Air Force designations, it was designated the A3J Vigilante.\n The aircraft briefly replaced the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior as the Navy's primary nuclear-strike aircraft, but its RA-5C tactical strike reconnaissance variant saw extensive service during the Vietnam War.",
  "/wiki/RVAH-3": "RVAH-3 was a Reconnaissance Attack (Heavy) Squadron of the U.S. Navy that served as the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for the RVAH community. Originally established as Heavy Attack Squadron Three (VAH-3) on 15 June 1956, it was redesignated as Reconnaissance Attack (Heavy) Squadron Three (RVAH-3) on 1 July 1964. The squadron was disestablished on 17 August 1979.",
  "/wiki/Douglas_A-3_Skywarrior": "The Douglas A-3 Skywarrior was a jet-powered strategic bomber developed and produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company.\n It was designed by Douglas on behalf of the United States Navy, which sought a carrier-capable strategic bomber. During July 1949, Douglas was awarded the contract to produce its design, having bested eight other aircraft companies' submissions. Unlike rival designs, which had aimed for a 100,000\u00a0lb (45,000\u00a0kg) maximum take-off weight, the Skywarrior was developed for a 68,000\u00a0lb (31,000\u00a0kg) take-off weight, facilitating its use from the navy's existing Midway-class aircraft carriers. Large portions of the aircraft were produced by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, including its early Westinghouse J40 turbojet engines, which failed to meet promises and were replaced by the rival Pratt & Whitney J57 engine by mid-1953. On 28 October 1952, the prototype XA3D-1 performed the type's maiden flight.\n On 31 March 1956, the Skywarrior entered squadron service with the Navy. Initially used in the nuclear-armed strategic bomber role, the emergence of effective ballistic missiles led to this mission being deprioritised by the early 1960s. Throughout the majority of its later service life, the Skywarrior was tasked with various secondary missions, which included use as an electronic warfare platform, tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and high capacity aerial refueling tanker. It was among the longest serving carrier-based aircraft in history, having entered service during the mid-1950s and withdrawn from use in 1991. Throughout its service, the Skywarrior was the heaviest operational aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier, which contributed to its nickname of \"Whale\".\n The Skywarrior is one of only two U.S. Navy attack aircraft intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service, the other being its predecessor, the North American AJ Savage. The carrier-based supersonic North American A-5 Vigilante was also originally designed for strategic nuclear strike missions and initially, very briefly, supplanted the A-3 in that role beginning in the early 1960s. A modified derivative of the Skywarrior, the B-66 Destroyer, served in the United States Air Force, where it was operated as a tactical bomber, electronic warfare aircraft, and aerial reconnaissance platform up until its withdrawal during the 1970s.",
  "/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk": "The Douglas A-4 Skyhawk is a single-seat subsonic carrier-capable attack aircraft developed for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps in the early 1950s. The delta-winged, single turbojet engined Skyhawk was designed and produced by Douglas Aircraft Company, and later by McDonnell Douglas. It was originally designated A4D under the U.S. Navy's pre-1962 designation system.\n The Skyhawk is a relatively lightweight aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight of 24,500 pounds (11,100\u00a0kg) and has a top speed of more than 670 miles per hour (1,080\u00a0km/h). The aircraft's five hardpoints support a variety of missiles, bombs and other munitions. It is capable of carrying a bomb load equivalent to that of a World War II\u2013era Boeing B-17 bomber, and can deliver nuclear weapons using a low-altitude bombing system and a \"loft\" delivery technique. The A-4 was originally powered by the Wright J65 turbojet engine; from the A-4E onwards, the Pratt & Whitney J52 engine was used.\n Skyhawks played key roles in the Vietnam War, the Yom Kippur War, and the Falklands War. Sixty years after the aircraft's first flight in 1954, some of the 2,960 produced (through February 1979) remain in service with the Argentine Air Force and the Brazilian Naval Aviation.",

  "/wiki/List_of_inactive_United_States_Navy_aircraft_squadrons": "There are hundreds of US Navy aircraft squadrons which are not currently active dating back to before World War II (the U.S. Navy operated aircraft prior to World War I, but it did not organize them in squadrons until after that war). To be more accurate: there are hundreds of former U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been disestablished and no longer exist and there are approximately 40 or so U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons which have been deactivated and which currently exist only \"on paper\" in an inactive status. These disestablished and/or deactivated squadrons are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"decommissioned\" squadrons, but proper usage prior to 1998, was that squadrons were \"established\" and \"disestablished\" and after 1998, squadrons are \"established\", \"deactivated\" and sometimes \"reactivated\". It has never been correct to refer to U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons as being \"commissioned\" and \"decommissioned\", ships are commissioned and decommissioned, U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons are not."
