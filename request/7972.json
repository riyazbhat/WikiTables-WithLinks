  "/wiki/Robert_Dunstan": "Robert Dunstan (1877 \u2013 1963) was a British doctor and political activist.\n Dunstan qualified as both a barrister and a medical doctor.  He worked as a general practitioner, and was a member of Gray's Inn.  He stood for the Liberal Party, unsuccessfully, in Totnes in December 1910 on a platform of land reform, and the local party again adopted him as their candidate for the General Election expected to take place in 1914/15.\n During World War I, Dunstan served in Mesopotamia as a lieutenant with the Royal Army Medical Corps.  He returned to the UK in 1917, resigned from the Liberal Party, and instead joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP).  Through his membership of the ILP, he was adopted as the Labour Party candidate in Birmingham Moseley at the 1918 general election.  He took 16% of the vote and second place in a campaign notable for the large crowds who came to hear him speak.  He also ran as the Labour candidate for the 1919 Manchester Rusholme by-election.\n Dunstan's wife died in 1921, and the following year, he married Margaret MacCallum, a fellow doctor.\n At the 1922 general election, Dunstan stood in Birmingham Ladywood against Neville Chamberlain.  He focused his campaign on poor health and education for working-class people in the city, calling Birmingham a \"rotten and benighted city\", while also maintaining his focus on land reform.  He came within 2,500 votes of unseating Chamberlain, and improved his vote again at the 1923 general election.\n Early in 1924, Dunstan visited the Soviet Union, and concluded that conditions for workers were better there than in Britain.  Shortly afterwards, he resigned from the ILP and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).  He tried to get the local Labour Party in Ladywood to re-adopt him for the 1924 general election, but they would not.  He instead stood in Birmingham West for the CPGB, describing himself as a \"workers' candidate\"; he gained the backing of several local Labour Party branches, and won 32% of the vote.\n In 1928, the Labour Party banned CPGB activists from holding joint membership.  Despite this, the Edgbaston Labour Party voted not to expel Dunstan; this led the national Labour Party to disaffiliate the branch and form a new one.  Surprisingly, the CPGB decided Dunstan should run in Bethnal Green South West at the 1929 general election; this was closer to his home in Fulham, but he did not perform well, taking only 7.7% of the vote.\n Dunstan remained active in less high-profile roles in communist politics in Birmingham until the end of World War II.  He died in 1963.",

  "/wiki/Alec_Geddes": "Alexander Geddes (born 1878) was Scottish communist activist.\n Geddes was born in Wick, and worked there as a fish smoker.  He then moved to Greenock, where he worked in a torpedo factory during World War I.\n Geddes joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union and, inspired by the Clyde Workers' Committee, Geddes became a prominent figure in the Greenock Workers' Committee.  His first political speech was in the run-up to the 1918 general election, in support of Fred Shaw, the unsuccessful British Socialist Party candidate for Greenock.\n He attended the Communist Unity Convention of 1920 on behalf of the committee, where he argued that there should be an independent Scottish communist party, a view he shared with John Maclean.  As a result, he became a founder member of the Scottish Communist Party, and was appointed as its treasurer.  However, the views of the party's committee were defeated at its founding meeting, which instead voted to seek amalgamation with the new Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and Geddes acceded to this, becoming a member of the CPGB himself.\n Geddes became the chair of the Greenock Unemployed Workers' Committee and was nominated by them to stand at the 1922 general election.  He also had the support of both the CPGB and the local trades and labour council and Independent Labour Party (ILP).  However, he did not try to win the support of the national Labour Party to stand as an official candidate for them.  He took 9,776 votes, coming second with 34.1% of the votes cast.  He was again nominated by the local trades and labour council for the 1923 election; in protest, the ILP withdrew from the council, and it was derecognised by the national Labour Party.  Despite this, he increased his vote in the election to 10,335 votes, 38% of the total.  Around this time, he also won election to Greenock parish council, serving a single term.\n At the 1924 general election, Geddes was again adopted by the local trades council, but this time ran against an official Labour Party candidate, a member of the ILP.  He managed to beat the official candidate, taking second place, with 29.0%.  His final contest came in 1929, again against Labour opposition, when he took 20%.\n Geddes visited the Soviet Union in 1925, where he viewed the Red Army on the Polish border, and received a banner from the Samara Cavalry Division as a gift, which he presented to the CPGB.  His daughter, Effie, became a leading figure in the CPGB's \"British Pioneers\" children's movement.  She led a group of Pioneers on a tour of Russia in 1933, but unexpectedly became ill and died.  Following this, Geddes appears to have withdrawn from activism.",

  "/wiki/William_Paul_(British_politician)": "William Paul (1884\u20131958), often known as Willie or Bill Paul, was a British socialist politician.\n Born in Glasgow, Paul became an active socialist and joined the Socialist Labour Party (SLP).  In 1911, he moved to Derby, where he ran a market stall selling hosiery and drapery.  Moving his stall from city to city, he was able to link SLP members across northern England and the Midlands, and surreptitiously distribute radical literature.\n Paul fully endorsed the SLP's opposition to World War I, and he supported Derby anti-war activist Alice Wheeldon.  In 1917, he authored The State: its Origin and Functions, in which he developed the Marxist theory of the state.  He became co-editor of the SLP's newspaper, The Socialist, and stood for the party in the 1918 general election in Ince, taking 13% of the votes cast.\n Within the SLP, he was a proponent of communist unity, and after this was rejected by the majority of the party, he became a founder member of the Communist Unity Group.  This group joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) at its founding conference, where Paul put the case against affiliation to the Labour Party.  Although the new party voted to affiliate, the Labour Party refused to accept this.\n In 1921, Paul became the editor of the CPGB's publication Communist Review, and he stood for Parliament in Manchester Rusholme at the 1923 and 1924 general elections.  Ironically, his candidacies were supported by the local Labour Party.\n Paul then became the editor of the Sunday Worker, published by the National Left-Wing Movement.

  "/wiki/Alfred_Wall": "Alfred Mervyn Wall (1 November 1889 \u2013 2 October 1957) was a British trade unionist and political activist.\n Born in East Hamlet, Shropshire, Wall moved to London to work as a compositor, and was a member of the British Socialist Party (BSP).  This affiliated to the Labour Party after World War I, and Wall was unexpectedly elected to Wandsworth Metropolitan Borough Council for Clapham North in 1918.  In this role, he frequently clashed with the local socialist preacher and pioneer druid George Watson Macgregor Reid.  He was also sympathetic to anarchism, and chaired the Frank Kitz Appeal Committee.\n Wall represented the BSP's Clapham branch at the meeting which founded the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and subsequently sat as a Communist councillor.  Initially one of the communist's main speakers in London, he stood as a joint Communist Party-Labour Party candidate in Streatham at the 1924 general election, taking 13.8% of the vote.\n Wall represented the London Society of Compositors at the Labour Party conference in 1925, and eventually defected to the party, although he was still a communist in 1927, when he became a joint secretary of the \"Hands Off China\" campaign.  In 1926, he was elected as Secretary of the London Trades Council.  While holding this position, he spent much of his time promoting a trade union for actors, based on a closed shop principle.  This became Equity, and he was elected as its first secretary.  Later in the 1930s, he also served as a vice-president of the Spanish Medical Aid Committee,\n In 1938, Wall was elected as General Secretary of the London Society of Compositors, and stood down from the London Trades Council.  During World War II, he served on the National Arbitration Union, and on Lord Swinton's Security Executive.\n Wall retired from his union posts in 1945, but worked for a while as the secretary and welfare officer of C. and E.
