  "/wiki/Platte_River": "The Platte River /pl\u00e6t/ is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km) long. Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over 1,050 miles (1,690\u00a0km). The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islands\u2014a braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers.[citation needed]",
