Public restrooms, concessions and the press box are located in the South Pavilion. The Central Pavilion contains the ticket booths, Wall of Champions and Recognition Center.\n Track events held in the Center include high jump, pole vault, long jump, and triple jump.

A pro soccer team, the Charlotte Eagles, have also used Transamerica Field for home games.\n Originally considered for expansion to host the Charlotte 49ers new football team, estimates of expansion for football usage made by leading sports design firm Populous were prohibitively expensive due to location restrictions and environmental concerns involving the Toby Creek flood plain. Subsequently, the university chose to build a dedicated football stadium west of Hayes Stadium, named Jerry Richardson Stadium.\n Title IX scholarship requirements related to the addition of the Charlotte 49ers football program will most likely mean that Belk will soon be home to either a potential 49ers future field hockey team or women's lacrosse team. Facilities upgrades, including the possibility of replacing the grass field with artificial turf, might be needed to handle the added usage.",
