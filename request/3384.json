One element of the process of understanding and proclaiming Jesus was the attribution of titles to him. Some of the titles that were gradually used in the early Church and then appeared in the New Testament were adopted from the Jewish context of the age, while others were selected to refer to, and underscore the message, mission and teachings of Jesus. In time, some of these titles gathered significant Christological significance. Christians have attached theological significance to the Holy Name of Jesus.

  "/wiki/Assumption_of_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary": "The Assumption of Mary into Heaven (often shortened to the Assumption) is, according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life. In the churches that observe it, the Assumption is a major feast day, commonly celebrated on 15 August. In many countries, the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory. This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950, in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility. While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God (Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God), whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined. In Munificentissimus Deus (item 39) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis (3:15) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam (Christ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54: then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition, nor of the Assumption of Mary, but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus (see below).",

The bishopric of Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne (since Roman times) and (early medieval) bishopric of M\u00e2con, also suffragans of Lyon, were united to Autun after the French Revolution by the Concordat signed by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, and Pope Pius VII. For a short time, from 1802 to 1822, the enlarged diocese of Autun was suffragan to the Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on. In 1822, however, Autun was again subject to the Archbishop of Lyon. The diocese of Autun is now, since 8 December 2002, suffragan to the Archbishop of Dijon. The current bishop of Autun is Benoit Rivi\u00e8re.",
  "/wiki/Autun": "Autun (French pronunciation: \u200b[ot\u0153\u0303]) is a commune in the Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire department, France. Located in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 region, it was founded during the Principate era of the early Roman Empire by Emperor Augustus as Augustodunum to give a Roman capital to the Gallic people Aedui, who had Bibracte as their political centre. In Roman times the city may have been home to 30,000 to 100,000 people, according to different estimates. Nowadays, Autun has a population of about 15,000.",
  "/wiki/Lazarus_of_Aix": "Saint Lazarus of Aix (French: Lazare d'Aix) (d. 441) was the first verifiable bishop of Aix-en-Provence, in France. He was appointed to his bishopric by the usurper emperor Constantine III in 408, and stripped of his office after Constantine was deposed by the future Constantius II in 411. Together with Heros of Arles, who had likewise been appointed by Constantine and deposed by Constantius, he then spent several years in Palestine before returning to Marseille, where he died on 3 August 441.\n Although never canonised, he is venerated as a saint thanks to a confusion with his namesake, Lazarus, the friend of Jesus. Some of his relics are preserved in the Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille, where his epitaph is also to be found, and others are kept in Autun Cathedral, which is dedicated to him.",
  "/wiki/Nazarius_and_Celsus": "Saints Nazarius and Celsus (Italian: San Nazaro e San Celso) were two martyrs of whom nothing is known except the discovery of their bodies by Saint Ambrose.\n According to Paulinus the Deacon's Vita Ambrosii, Ambrose, at some time within the last three years of his life, after the death of the Emperor Theodosius (d. 395), discovered in a garden outside the walls of Milan the body of Saint Nazarius, with severed head.  Nazarius's blood was reportedly still liquid and red when his body was exhumed by Ambrose.  Ambrose had it carried to the Basilica of the Apostles. In the same garden Ambrose likewise discovered the body of Saint Celsus, which he had transported to the same place. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: Obviously a tradition regarding these martyrs was extant in the Christian community of Milan which led to the finding of the two bodies.",
  "/wiki/List_of_cathedrals_in_France": "This is a list of cathedrals in France and in the French overseas departments, territories and collectivities, including both actual and former diocesan cathedrals (seats of bishops). Almost all cathedrals in France are Roman Catholic, but any non-Roman Catholic cathedrals are listed here as well.\n The list is intended to be complete as far as current cathedrals and co-cathedrals are concerned. It is not yet an exhaustive list of former cathedrals, although it includes most of them.\n A number of large churches in France are known as cathedral as a mark of distinction or historical importance but have never been the seats of bishops. These are not included here."
