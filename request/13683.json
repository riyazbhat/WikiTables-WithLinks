  "/wiki/Botox": "Botulinum toxin (Botox) is a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes flaccid paralysis. Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially for medical and cosmetic purposes. There are seven main types of botulinum toxin, named type A-G. New types are occasionally found. Types A and B are capable of causing disease in humans, and are also used commercially and medically. Types C-G are less common; types E and F can cause disease in humans, while the other types cause disease in other animals. Botulinum toxin types A and B are used in medicine to treat various muscle spasms. Botulinum toxin is the most acutely lethal toxin known. Intoxication can occur naturally as a result of either wound or intestinal infection or by ingesting preformed toxin in food. The estimated human median lethal dose (LD50) of type A toxin is 1.3-2.1 ng/kg intravenously or intramuscularly, 10-13 ng/kg when inhaled, or 1000 ng/kg when taken by mouth. Commercial forms are marketed under the brand names Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), Dysport/Azzalure (abobotulinumtoxinA), Xeomin/Bocouture (incobotulinumtoxinA), and Jeuveau (prabotulinumtoxinA).",

  "/wiki/Microblading": "Microblading is a tattooing technique in which a small handheld tool made of several tiny needles is used to add semi-permanent pigment to the skin. Microblading differs from standard eyebrow tattooing because each hairstroke is created by hand using a blade which creates fine slices in the skin, whereas eyebrow tattoos are done with a machine and single needle. Microblading is typically used on eyebrows to create, enhance or reshape their appearance in terms of both shape and color. It deposits pigment into the upper region of the dermis, so it fades more rapidly than traditional tattooing techniques, which deposit pigment deeper. Microblading artists are not necessarily tattoo artists, and vice versa, because the techniques require different training. Microblading is also sometimes called embroidery, feather touch or hair-like strokes."
