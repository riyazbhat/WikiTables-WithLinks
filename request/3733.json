  "/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_Canada": "The following is a list of the busiest airports in Canada. The airports are ranked by passenger traffic and aircraft movements. For each airport, the lists cite the city served by the airport as designated by Transport Canada, not necessarily the municipality where the airport is physically located.\n Since 2010, Toronto-Pearson and Vancouver International have been the two busiest airports by both passengers served and aircraft movements. Toronto-Pearson's location within the most populous metropolitan region of Canada solidifies its top spot amongst all of Canada's airports, serving more passengers and having more aircraft movements than the top two other airports combined. Given its advantageous position on the west coast of Canada, Vancouver International has long served as Canada's hub for flights bound for Asia and Oceania."
