  "/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.82_Tiger_Moth": "The de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth is a 1930s British biplane designed by Geoffrey de Havilland and built by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. It was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and many other operators as a primary trainer aircraft. In addition to the type's principal use for ab-initio training, the Second World War saw RAF Tiger Moths operating in other capacities, including maritime surveillance and defensive anti-invasion preparations; some aircraft were even outfitted to function as armed light bombers.",
  "/wiki/Fieseler_Fi_103R_Reichenberg": "The Fieseler Fi 103R, code-named Reichenberg, was a late-World War II German crewed version of the V-1 flying bomb (more correctly known as the Fieseler Fi 103) produced for attacks in which the pilot was likely to be killed (as actually intended, for use of the Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service's Ohka rocket-powered kamikaze suicide anti-ship missile) or at best to parachute down at the attack site, which were to be carried out by the \"Leonidas Squadron\", V. Gruppe of the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 200.",

  "/wiki/Interstate_TDR": "The Interstate TDR was an early unmanned combat aerial vehicle \u2014 referred to at the time as an \"assault drone\" \u2014 developed by the Interstate Aircraft and Engineering Corporation during the Second World War for use by the United States Navy. Capable of being armed with bombs or torpedoes, 2000 aircraft were ordered, but only around 200 were built. The type saw some service in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese, but continuing developmental issues affecting the aircraft, along with the success of operations using more conventional weapons, led to the decision being made to cancel the assault drone program in October 1944.",
  "/wiki/UCAV": "An unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), also known as a combat drone or simply a drone, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that usually carries aircraft ordnance such as missiles, ATGMs, and/or bombs and is used for drone strikes. These drones are usually under real-time human control, with varying levels of autonomy. Aircraft of this type have no onboard human pilot. As the operator runs the vehicle from a remote terminal,  equipment necessary for a human pilot is not needed, resulting in a lower weight and a smaller size than a manned aircraft. China, Israel, Turkey and the United States are widely recognized as industry leaders in UCAV technology. Several other countries have operational domestic UCAVs and many more have imported armed drones or have development programs underway.",
  "/wiki/McDonnell_TD2D_Katydid": "The McDonnell TD2D Katydid was a pulsejet-powered American target drone produced by McDonnell Aircraft that entered service with the United States Navy in 1942, and continued in use until the late 1940s.",
  "/wiki/Naval_Aircraft_Factory_TDN": "The Naval Aircraft Factory TDN was an early unmanned combat aerial vehicle - referred to at the time as an \"assault drone\" - developed by the United States Navy's Naval Aircraft Factory during the Second World War. Developed and tested during 1942 and 1943, the design proved moderately successful, but development of improved drones saw the TDN-1 relegated to second-line duties, and none were used in operational service.",
  "/wiki/Naval_Aircraft_Modification_Unit_KDN_Gorgon": "The Naval Aircraft Modification Unit KDN Gorgon, originally designated TD2N, was an early jet-powered target drone developed by the Bureau of Aeronautics and constructed by the Naval Aircraft Modification Unit for use by the United States Navy. First flown near the end of World War II, it was cancelled due to problems with its engine in 1946.",
  "/wiki/Radioplane_OQ-2": "The OQ-2 Radioplane was the first mass-produced UAV or drone in the United States, manufactured by the Radioplane Company. A follow-on version, the OQ-3, became the most widely used target drone in US service, with over 9,400 being built during World War II.",
  "/wiki/V-1_Flying_Bomb": "The V-1 flying bomb (German: Vergeltungswaffe 1 \"Vengeance Weapon 1\"[a])\u2014also known to the Allies as the buzz bomb, or doodlebug,[b] and in Germany as Kirschkern (cherry stone)[c] or Maik\u00e4fer (maybug)[d], as well as by its official RLM aircraft designation of Fi 103\u2014was an early cruise missile and the only production aircraft to use a pulsejet for power.",
  "/wiki/V-2_rocket": "The V-2 (German: Vergeltungswaffe 2, \"Retribution Weapon 2\"), technical name Aggregat 4 (A4), was the world's first long-range guided ballistic missile. The missile, powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine, was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a \"vengeance weapon\", assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities. The V-2 rocket also became the first man-made object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.",

  "/wiki/List_of_aircraft_of_World_War_II": "The List of aircraft of World War II includes all the aircraft used by those countries which were at war during World War II from the period between their joining the conflict and the conflict ending for them. Aircraft developed but not used operationally in the war are in the prototypes section at the end. Prototypes for aircraft that entered service under a different design number are ignored in favour of the service version. The date the aircraft entered service, or was first flown if the service date is unknown or it did not enter service follows the name, followed by the country of origin and major wartime users. Aircraft used for multiple roles are generally only listed under their primary role unless specialized versions were built for other roles in significant numbers. Aircraft used by neutral countries such as Spain, Switzerland and Sweden or countries which did no significant fighting such as most of those in South America (except Brazil), are not included."
