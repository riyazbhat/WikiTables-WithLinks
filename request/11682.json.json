  "/wiki/World_Series_of_Poker_bracelet": "The World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP.  Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as \"bracelets\".  During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year.  In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events.  By 2000, that number increased to 24.  As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased.  In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia. In 2017, 74 for bracelets were awarded at the WSOP and an additional 11 will be awarded at the WSOPE in Czech Republic.",
