  "/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Highway_74": "State Highway 74, usually abbreviated as SH-74 or OK-74 (or simply Highway 74) is the numbering of two different highways maintained by the U.S. state of Oklahoma. These highways were once a single major north\u2013south route, connecting Oklahoma City to more rural parts of the state. The original road stretched from SH-7 near Tatums, Oklahoma to SH-11 west of Deer Creek. Due to encroaching Interstate highways\u2014especially Interstate 35\u2014the middle section of the route through Norman, Moore, and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 for reasons of redundancy. However, some maps show SH-74 as concurrent with I-35, I-240, and I-44, thus linking the two sections. The north section of the route is 91 1\u20442 miles (147.3 km) in length, while the southern section is 52 1\u20442 miles (84.5 km) long. This leads to a total length of 144 miles (232 km).",
