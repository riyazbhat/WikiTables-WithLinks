  "/wiki/Nelson_complexity_index": "The Nelson complexity index (NCI) is a measure to compare the secondary conversion capacity of a petroleum refinery with the primary distillation capacity.  The index provides an easy metric for quantifying and ranking the complexity of various refineries and units. To calculate the index, it is necessary to use complexity factors, which compare the cost of upgrading units to the cost of crude distillation unit.",
  "/wiki/Barrel_(unit)": "A barrel is one of several units of volume applied in various contexts; there are dry barrels, fluid barrels (such as the U.K. beer barrel and U.S. beer barrel), oil barrels and so forth. For historical reasons the volumes of some barrel units are roughly double the volumes of others; volumes in common usage range approximately from 100 to 200 litres (22 to 44\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 26 to 53\u00a0US\u00a0gal). In many connections the term \"drum\" is used almost interchangeably with \"barrel\".",

Encana subsequently spun off oil sands producer Cenovus and ConocoPhillips spun off Phillips 66.  In return for a 49% stake in the refinery, ConocoPhillips gained a joint interest in two Alberta oil sands (bitumen) heavy oil projects: Christina Lake (Alberta) and Foster Creek. ConocoPhillips\u2019 interest was sold to Cenovus in May 2017, leaving Cenovus the sole owner and operator of the assets.
