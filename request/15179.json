When the $100 Film Festival was born in 1992, it showcased eight short films on Super 8.

In following years, the festival dropped the budgetary limit and allowed 16 mm film, which shifted the focus from low budget to quality small-format films. Thus, the name was changed to the Artifact Small Format Film Festival in 2017 so as to better represent the festival's role as an international celebration of creative story telling on celluloid.\n Over the years, Artifact has expanded to include the popular Film/Music Explosion!, commission projects, and various partnerships.\n Artifact is one of only a handful of festivals worldwide that exhibit exclusively on small-format celluloid.",
