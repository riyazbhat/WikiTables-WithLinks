  "/wiki/Louis_Agassiz": "Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (/\u02c8\u00e6\u0261\u0259si/; French: [a\u0261asi]; May 28, 1807 - December 14, 1873) was a Swiss biologist and geologist recognized as an innovative and prodigious scholar of Earth's natural history. Agassiz grew up in Switzerland. He received doctor of philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich, respectively. After studying with Cuvier and Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel. He emigrated to the United States in 1847 after visiting Harvard University. He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, to head its Lawrence Scientific School, and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology. Agassiz is known for his regimen of observational data gathering and analysis. He made vast institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and related areas, including writing multivolume research books running to thousands of pages. He is particularly known for his contributions to ichthyological classification, including of extinct species such as megalodon, and to the study of geological history, including to the founding of glaciology. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Agassiz's resistance to Darwinian evolution, belief in creationism, and the scientific racism implicit in his writings on human polygenism have tarnished his reputation, and led to controversies over his legacy.",
  "/wiki/Ice_age": "An ice age is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Earth's climate alternates between ice ages and greenhouse periods, during which there are no glaciers on the planet. Earth is currently in the Quaternary glaciation, known in popular terminology as the Ice Age. Individual pulses of cold climate within an ice age are termed glacial periods (or, alternatively, glacials, glaciations, glacial stages, stadials, stades, or colloquially, ice ages), and intermittent warm periods within an ice age are called interglacials or interstadials, with both climatic pulses part of the Quaternary or other periods in Earth's history. In the terminology of glaciology, ice age implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres. By this definition, we are in an interglacial period - the Holocene. The amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth's oceans and atmosphere are predicted to prevent the next glacial period, which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more glacial cycles.",

  "/wiki/Louis_Lliboutry": "Louis Lliboutry (born 19 February 1922 in Madrid; died on 21 October 2007 in Grenoble) was a French glaciologist, geophysicist, and mountaineer. While in Chile in the early 1950s, he analysed and explained the formation of snow penitents in the Andes, which marked his first contribution to glaciology. He founded in Grenoble in 1958 the Laboratory of Alpine Glaciology and headed it for 25 years; he also set up at that period a pioneering syllabus in geophysics. His contributions to mechanics of viscous media (such as ice and the Earth's mantle) and to geodynamics are internationally acknowledged.",
  "/wiki/Penitente_(snow_formation)": "Penitentes, or nieves penitentes (Spanish for penitent-shaped snows), are snow formations found at high altitudes. They take the form of elongated, thin blades of hardened snow or ice, closely spaced and pointing towards the general direction of the sun. The name comes from the resemblance of a field of penitentes to a crowd of kneeling people doing penance. The formation evokes the tall, pointed habits and hoods worn by brothers of religious orders in the Processions of Penance during Spanish Holy Week. In particular the brothers' hats are tall, narrow, and white, with a pointed top. These spires of snow and ice grow over all glaciated and snow-covered areas in the Dry Andes above 4,000 metres or 13,120 feet. They range in length from a few centimetres to over 5 metres or 16 feet.",
  "/wiki/Mark_Meier": "Mark F. Meier (1925 - November 25, 2012) was an American glaciologist who was considered a leading expert on the study of rising sea levels due to the melting of glaciers. Meier was the Director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) from 1985 to 1994 and remained the institute's director emeritus until his death in 2012. He was also a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado - Boulder. Meier was born and raised in Iowa. He resided in Boulder, Colorado, since 1985. In 1956, Meier founded the U.S. Geological Survey's department of glaciology. He obtained doctorate in 1957 from the California Institute of Technology. Meier served as the director of the U.S. Geological Survey's Project Office of Glaciology in Tacoma, Washington, until he became the director of INSTAAR in 1985. Meier was one of the first glaciologists to use remote sensing to study glaciers and rates of melting. He headed several studies of tidewater glacier dynamics in the U.S. state of Alaska. Meier organized the systematic measurement and assessment of glacier mass balance within North America to mark the International Geophysical Year and International Hydrological Decade, which was observed from 1965 to 1975. His numerous recognitions and awards included the Seligman Crystal from the International Glaciological Society in 1985, the Robert E.

  "/wiki/Glacier_motion": "Glacial motion is the motion of glaciers, which can be likened to rivers of ice. It has played an important role in sculpting many landscapes. Most lakes in the world occupy basins scoured out by glaciers.

The glacier is classified as polythermal having both cold and warm bottom temperatures. It was on Storglaci\u00e4ren that the first glacier mass balance research program began (immediately after World War II), which continues to the present day; this is the longest continuous study of its type in the world. Storglaci\u00e4ren has had a cumulative negative mass balance of -17 m between 1946-2006. The program began monitoring the Rabots Glaci\u00e4r in 1982, Riukojietna in 1985, and M\u00e5rmaglaci\u00e4ren in 1988.
