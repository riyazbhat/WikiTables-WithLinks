  "/wiki/Canada_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics": "Canada, represented by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. Canadian athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the United States-led boycott. Canada sent a total of 281 athletes to the Games to compete in 24 sports. The COC set a goal of finishing in the top 12 for total medals; but the nation failed to achieve this, finishing with a total of 18 medals. Canada matched its total medal count from Beijing 2008.\n Canada was initially believed to have won only 1 gold medal in London, its lowest count of golds in a Summer Olympic games since 1976; this was awarded to trampoline gymnast Rosannagh MacLennan in the women's event.  Weightlifter Christine Girard, initially the bronze medallist in the 63 kg event for the ladies, was subsequently upgraded to the gold medal position following the disqualification of the gold and silver medallists for doping.  This raised Canada's gold medal count to 2.\n In addition to the gold medals, Canada left London with 5 silver and 11 bronze medals. Diving pair \u00c9milie Heymans and Jennifer Abel won the nation's first medal in the women's synchronized springboard event. Heymans, became the first Canadian athlete to win Olympic medals in four consecutive games. Canada also won the bronze medal match in the women's soccer tournament, the first for the nation since 1904, and the first in a traditional team sport since 1936.  Prior to Girard's being upgraded to the gold medal, Canada's performance was believed to have broken the record for the highest total medal count for a nation with only one gold medal. This was despite several Canadian athletes just missing out of the medal finishes including the men's 4 x 100 m sprint relay team who were disqualified after finishing in third."
