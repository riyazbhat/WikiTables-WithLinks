  "/wiki/County_(New_York)": "The administrative divisions of New York are the various units of government that provide local services, local meaning not statewide, in the State of New York. The New York State Constitution standardized the names and functions of these statewide.[where?][when?] The State is divided into boroughs, counties, cities, townships, called towns, and villages. (The only boroughs, the five boroughs of New York City, except for the Bronx have the same boundaries as their predecessor counties.) They are municipal corporations, chartered (created) by the New York State Legislature, under the New York State Constitution the only body that can create governmental units in the state. All of them have their own governments, sometimes with no paid employees, that provide local services. Centers of population that are not incorporated and have no government or local services are designated hamlets. Whether a municipality is defined as a borough, city, town, or village is determined not by population or land area, but rather on the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York Legislature.",
