  "/wiki/Bratwurst": "Bratwurst (German: [\u02c8b\u0281a\u02d0tv\u028a\u0250\u032fst] (listen)) is a type of German sausage made from veal, beef, or most commonly pork. The name is derived from the Old High German Br\u00e4twurst, from br\u00e4t-, finely chopped meat, and Wurst, sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb braten, to pan fry or roast. Beef and veal are usual in halal and kosher bratwurst, which never include pork for religious reasons.",
  "/wiki/Green_Sauce": "Green sauce is a family of cold, uncooked sauces based on herbs, including the Spanish and Italian salsa verde, the French sauce verte, the German Gr\u00fcne So\u00dfe or Frankfurter Grie So\u00df (Frankfurt dialect), and the Argentinian chimichurri.\n The Mexican salsa verde, though also called a \"green sauce\", is instead based on tomatillos; the New Mexico version uses a green chile base.",
  "/wiki/Frankfurter_W\u00fcrstchen": "A Frankfurter W\u00fcrstchen (German for Frankfurt sausage) is a thin parboiled sausage made of pure pork in a casing of sheep's intestine. The special taste is acquired by a special method of low temperature smoking. For consumption, Frankfurters are not cooked; they are only heated in hot water for about eight minutes which prevents the skin from bursting. They are traditionally served with bread, mustard, horseradish and/or potato salad.",

[g] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area[b] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast.",
  "/wiki/Hot_dog": "The hot dog (also spelled hotdog) or dog is a grilled or steamed sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. It can also refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is the wiener (Vienna sausage) or frankfurter (also frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, and cheese sauce, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, jalape\u00f1os, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, and olives.

  "/wiki/Apfelwein": "Apfelwein ([\u0294apfl\u0329\u02c8va\u026an] Germany, apple wine), or Viez ([fi\u02d0ts] Moselfranken, Saarland, Trier, vice) or Most ([m\u0254st] Austria, Switzerland, South Germany, must) are German words for cider. It is made from a mix of sour tasting apples, such as \"Bohnapfel\" or \"Speierling\", respectively.[citation needed]  It has an alcohol content of 4.8%\u20137.0% and a tart, sour taste.\n Apfelwein is also regionally known as Ebbelwoi, \u00c4ppler, St\u00f6ffsche, Apfelmost (apple must), Viez (from Latin vice, the second or substitute wine), and saurer Most (sour must, S\u00fc\u00dfmost or sweet must is essentially apple juice). Instead of the name \u00c4ppler, restaurants and smaller manufacturers may instead call the beverage Schoppen or Schoppe, which actually refers to the measure of the glass. \n In the Frankfurt area, berries from the service tree (Sorbus domestica) may be added in small quantities to increase astringency, in which case the specific type of Apfelwein is called Speierling. In modern times, the term Speierling is often also used to refer to any more sour variety of Apfelwein, even if it lacks any juice of the service tree.",
  "/wiki/Cider": "Cider (/\u02c8sa\u026ad\u0259r/ SY-d\u0259r) is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples. Cider is popular in the United Kingdom (especially in the West Country) and the Republic of Ireland and widely available. The UK has the world's highest per capita consumption, as well as its largest cider-producing companies. Cider is also popular in many Commonwealth countries, such as India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Aside from the UK and its former colonies, cider is popular in other European countries including Portugal (mainly in Minho and Madeira), France (particularly Brittany and Normandy), northern Italy (Piedmont and Friuli), and northern Spain (especially the Principality of Asturias and the Basque Country). Central Europe also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein. In the U.S., varieties of fermented cider are often called hard cider to distinguish alcoholic cider from non-alcoholic apple cider or \"sweet cider\", also made from apples. In Canada, cider cannot be called cider if there are no apples.",

  "/wiki/Schorle": "Schorle is a German beverage made by diluting juice or wine with carbonated water or lemonade (lemon-lime soda). The most common variety is Apfelschorle (made from apple juice and sparkling mineral water). Large bottles of Schorle can be found at most grocers, stores, supermarkets and anywhere else where carbonated drinks are sold, next to the soda. Due to its dilution it is less sweet or alcoholic than the original beverage, making it better suited as a refreshment on hot summer days or as an alternative to beer at the biergarten or weinstube [de].\n Typical proportions are half seltzer in a high glass and half juice or wine. In the Palatinate, in Germany, a wine schorle may consist of considerably less than 1/2 water if it is ordered 'fett' (German for 'fat').",
  "/wiki/Handk\u00e4se": "Handk\u00e4se (pronounced [\u02c8hantk\u025b\u02d0z\u0259]; literally: \"hand cheese\") is a German regional sour milk cheese (similar to Harzer) and is a culinary speciality of Frankfurt am Main, Offenbach am Main, Darmstadt, Langen, and other parts of southern Hesse. It gets its name from the traditional way of producing it: forming it with one's own hands. It is a small, translucent, yellow cheese with a pungent aroma that some people may find unpleasant. It is sometimes square, but more often round in shape. Often served as an appetizer or as a snack with Apfelwein (Ebbelwoi or cider), it is traditionally topped with chopped onions, locally known as \"Handk\u00e4se mit Musik\" (literally: hand cheese with music). It is usually eaten with caraway on it, but since many people in Germany do not like this spice, in many areas it is served on the side. Some Hessians say that it is a sign of the quality of the establishment when caraway is in a separate dispenser. As a sign of this, many restaurants have, in addition to the salt and pepper, a little pot for caraway seeds.",
  "/wiki/Harzer": "Harzer cheese is a German sour milk cheese made from low fat curd cheese, which contains only about one percent fat and originates in the Harz mountain region south of Braunschweig.\n Harzer is often small and round, in which case it is called Handk\u00e4se or Taler, or cylindrical, in which case it is called Stangenk\u00e4se. Frequently, the small and round variety is sold in a cylindrical package, which is then called Harzer Roller.\n Harzer cheese is typically flavoured with caraway. Some varieties are white mold cheeses, others red mold cheeses. The latter type generally has a stronger flavour, and both types develop a strong aroma after maturing for a few days or weeks. Harzer has a distinctive strong smell and overpowering flavour.\n Harzer contains very little fat (less than 1%) but extremely high protein (usually around 30%) and therefore is often used for special diets and sport nutrition.",
