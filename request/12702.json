  "/wiki/Bratwurst": "Bratwurst (German: [\u02c8b\u0281a\u02d0tv\u028a\u0250\u032fst] (listen)) is a type of German sausage made from veal, beef, or most commonly pork. The name is derived from the Old High German Br\u00e4twurst, from br\u00e4t-, finely chopped meat, and Wurst, sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb braten, to pan fry or roast. Beef and veal are usual in halal and kosher bratwurst, which never include pork for religious reasons.",
  "/wiki/Green_Sauce": "Green sauce is a family of cold, uncooked sauces based on herbs, including the Spanish and Italian salsa verde, the French sauce verte, the German Gr\u00fcne So\u00dfe or Frankfurter Grie So\u00df (Frankfurt dialect), and the Argentinian chimichurri.\n The Mexican salsa verde, though also called a \"green sauce\", is instead based on tomatillos; the New Mexico version uses a green chile base.",
  "/wiki/Frankfurter_W\u00fcrstchen": "A Frankfurter W\u00fcrstchen (German for Frankfurt sausage) is a thin parboiled sausage made of pure pork in a casing of sheep's intestine. The special taste is acquired by a special method of low temperature smoking. For consumption, Frankfurters are not cooked; they are only heated in hot water for about eight minutes which prevents the skin from bursting. They are traditionally served with bread, mustard, horseradish and/or potato salad.",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country consisting of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.[g] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area[b] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City.\n Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783, leading to independence. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century\u2014gradually acquiring new territories, displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states\u2014until by 1848 it spanned the continent.\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power.\n The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower. It was the first country to develop nuclear weapons and the only country to have used them in warfare. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\n A highly developed country, the United States is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, the second-largest by purchasing power parity, and accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods, by value. Although its population is 4% of the world total, it holds 31% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. Despite income and wealth disparities, the United States continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, median income, median wealth, human development, per capita GDP, and worker productivity. It is the foremost military power in the world, making up more than a third of global military spending, and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.",
  "/wiki/Hot_dog": "The hot dog (also spelled hotdog) or dog is a grilled or steamed sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. It can also refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is the wiener (Vienna sausage) or frankfurter (also frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, and cheese sauce, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, jalape\u00f1os, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.\n These types of sausages and their sandwiches were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States, where the \"hot dog\" became a working-class street food sold at stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century, and emerged as an important part of other regional cuisines, including Chicago street cuisine.",
  "/wiki/Apfelwein": "Apfelwein ([\u0294apfl\u0329\u02c8va\u026an] Germany, apple wine), or Viez ([fi\u02d0ts] Moselfranken, Saarland, Trier, vice) or Most ([m\u0254st] Austria, Switzerland, South Germany, must) are German words for cider. It is made from a mix of sour tasting apples, such as \"Bohnapfel\" or \"Speierling\", respectively.[citation needed]  It has an alcohol content of 4.8%\u20137.0% and a tart, sour taste.\n Apfelwein is also regionally known as Ebbelwoi, \u00c4ppler, St\u00f6ffsche, Apfelmost (apple must), Viez (from Latin vice, the second or substitute wine), and saurer Most (sour must, S\u00fc\u00dfmost or sweet must is essentially apple juice). Instead of the name \u00c4ppler, restaurants and smaller manufacturers may instead call the beverage Schoppen or Schoppe, which actually refers to the measure of the glass. \n In the Frankfurt area, berries from the service tree (Sorbus domestica) may be added in small quantities to increase astringency, in which case the specific type of Apfelwein is called Speierling. In modern times, the term Speierling is often also used to refer to any more sour variety of Apfelwein, even if it lacks any juice of the service tree.",
  "/wiki/Cider": "Cider (/\u02c8sa\u026ad\u0259r/ SY-d\u0259r) is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples. Cider is popular in the United Kingdom (especially in the West Country) and the Republic of Ireland and widely available. The UK has the world's highest per capita consumption, as well as its largest cider-producing companies. Cider is also popular in many Commonwealth countries, such as India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Aside from the UK and its former colonies, cider is popular in other European countries including Portugal (mainly in Minho and Madeira), France (particularly Brittany and Normandy), northern Italy (Piedmont and Friuli), and northern Spain (especially the Principality of Asturias and the Basque Country). Central Europe also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein. In the U.S., varieties of fermented cider are often called hard cider to distinguish alcoholic cider from non-alcoholic apple cider or \"sweet cider\", also made from apples. In Canada, cider cannot be called cider if there are no apples. Furthermore, according to the Food and Drug Regulations in Canada, cider cannot contain less than 2.5% or over 13% absolute alcohol by volume.\n The juice of most varieties of apple can be used to make cider, but cider apples are best. The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the ethanol content of the resulting beverage. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% to 8.5% ABV or more in traditional English ciders, and 3.5% to 12% in continental ciders. In UK law, it must contain at least 35% apple juice (fresh or from concentrate), although CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) says that \"real cider\" must be at least 90% fresh apple juice. In the US, there is a 50% minimum. In France, cider must be made solely from apples.\n In 2014, a study found that a 1-US-pint (470 ml) bottle of mass-market cider contained five teaspoons (20.5 g) of sugar, nearly the amount the WHO recommends as an adult's daily allowance of added sugar, and 5\u201310 times the amount of sugar in lager or ale.\nPerry is a similar product to cider made from fermented pear juice.",

  "/wiki/Schorle": "Schorle is a German beverage made by diluting juice or wine with carbonated water or lemonade (lemon-lime soda). The most common variety is Apfelschorle (made from apple juice and sparkling mineral water). Large bottles of Schorle can be found at most grocers, stores, supermarkets and anywhere else where carbonated drinks are sold, next to the soda. Due to its dilution it is less sweet or alcoholic than the original beverage, making it better suited as a refreshment on hot summer days or as an alternative to beer at the biergarten or weinstube [de].\n Typical proportions are half seltzer in a high glass and half juice or wine. In the Palatinate, in Germany, a wine schorle may consist of considerably less than 1/2 water if it is ordered 'fett' (German for 'fat').",
  "/wiki/Handk\u00e4se": "Handk\u00e4se (pronounced [\u02c8hantk\u025b\u02d0z\u0259]; literally: \"hand cheese\") is a German regional sour milk cheese (similar to Harzer) and is a culinary speciality of Frankfurt am Main, Offenbach am Main, Darmstadt, Langen, and other parts of southern Hesse. It gets its name from the traditional way of producing it: forming it with one's own hands.\n It is a small, translucent, yellow cheese with a pungent aroma that some people may find unpleasant. It is sometimes square, but more often round in shape.\n Often served as an appetizer or as a snack with Apfelwein (Ebbelwoi or cider), it is traditionally topped with chopped onions, locally known as \"Handk\u00e4se mit Musik\" (literally: hand cheese with music). It is usually eaten with caraway on it, but since many people in Germany do not like this spice, in many areas it is served on the side. Some Hessians say that it is a sign of the quality of the establishment when caraway is in a separate dispenser. As a sign of this, many restaurants have, in addition to the salt and pepper, a little pot for caraway seeds.\n Strangers to this custom probably ask where the Musik is.  They most likely are told, Die Musik kommt sp\u00e4ter, i.e. the music \"comes later\".  This is a euphemism for the flatulence that the raw onions usually provide.  A more polite, but less likely explanation for the Musik is that the flasks of vinegar and oil customarily provided with the cheese would strike a musical note when they hit each other. Handk\u00e4se is popular among dieters and some health food devotees. It is also popular among bodybuilders, runners, and weightlifters for its high content of protein while being relatively low in fat.",
  "/wiki/Harzer": "Harzer cheese is a German sour milk cheese made from low fat curd cheese, which contains only about one percent fat and originates in the Harz mountain region south of Braunschweig.\n Harzer is often small and round, in which case it is called Handk\u00e4se or Taler, or cylindrical, in which case it is called Stangenk\u00e4se. Frequently, the small and round variety is sold in a cylindrical package, which is then called Harzer Roller.\n Harzer cheese is typically flavoured with caraway. Some varieties are white mold cheeses, others red mold cheeses. The latter type generally has a stronger flavour, and both types develop a strong aroma after maturing for a few days or weeks. Harzer has a distinctive strong smell and overpowering flavour.\n Harzer contains very little fat (less than 1%) but extremely high protein (usually around 30%) and therefore is often used for special diets and sport nutrition.",
  "/wiki/Harz": "The Harz [ha\u02d0\u0250\u032fts] is a Mittelgebirge that has the highest elevations in Northern Germany and its rugged terrain extends across parts of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia.
