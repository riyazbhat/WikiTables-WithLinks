  "/wiki/Jellyfish_(band)": "Jellyfish was an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1989. Led by songwriters Andy Sturmer (drums, vocals) and Roger Manning (keyboards, vocals), the group was known for their blend of 1970s classic rock and XTC-style power pop. They released two albums, Bellybutton (1990) and Spilt Milk (1993), that proved highly influential to artists in a similar vein. Sturmer and Manning met in high school and shared an admiration for jazz, post-punk, and British pop music. Following a stint as members of Beatnik Beatch, they quit the group to continue songwriting with one another and formed Jellyfish with guitarist Jason Falkner, who left after the tour for Bellybutton. The group viewed Spilt Milk as their masterpiece and the fulfillment of their original grandiose vision for the band, emphasizing high-energy moods, vocal harmonies, and studio artifice. Jellyfish broke up in 1994 due to poor record sales, Sturmer's discomfort with his role as frontman, and artistic conflicts between the two songwriters. Manning subsequently formed Imperial Drag and pursued careers as a solo artist and session musician.",
