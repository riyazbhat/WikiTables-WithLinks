At the end of the Middle Ages, it was one of four boroughs in Lancashire established by Royal charter.\n During the Industrial Revolution Wigan experienced dramatic economic expansion and a rapid rise in population. Although porcelain manufacture and clock making had been major industries, Wigan became known as a major mill town and coal mining district. A coal mine was recorded in 1450 and at its peak, there were 1,000 pit shafts within 5 miles (8 km) of the town centre. Mining was so extensive that a town councillor remarked that \"a coal mine in the backyard was not uncommon in Wigan\". Coal mining ceased during the latter part of the 20th century.\n Wigan Pier, a wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, was made famous by the writer George Orwell.

Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893.
