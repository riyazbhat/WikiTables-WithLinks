  "/wiki/International_Avenue,_Calgary": "International Avenue is a Business Revitalization Zone (BRZ) in Calgary, Alberta. The district is centered on 17 Avenue SE in the neighbourhood of Forest Lawn in the east of the city. The district was created in 1993 to celebrate the rich cultural diversity that exists in east central Calgary. The area has since become a popular location for ethnic restaurants and shopping.\n The BRZ was also established to help revitalize the former town of Forest Lawn, which was annexed by the city in 1961. The neighbourhood has long had a reputation for being a haven for crime and drugs. In recent years, however, the area has been recognized for its multi-culturalism and has been slowly developing into a major destination for both Calgary residents and tourists. The city and the BRZ are currently in the process of implementing new urban design and redevelopment initiatives.\n Since 2003, International Avenue has played host to Calgary's large multi-cultural event, GlobalFest. GlobalFest combines both a celebration of diversity known as OneWorld Festival and an International Fireworks Festival at Elliston Park. The event takes place annually in late August.",

  "/wiki/William_Henry_Cushing": "William Henry Cushing (August 21, 1852 \u2013 January 25, 1934) was a Canadian politician.  Born in Ontario, he migrated west as a young adult where he started a successful lumber company and later became Alberta's first Minister of Public Works and the 11th mayor of Calgary.  As Minister of Public Works in the government of Alexander Cameron Rutherford, he oversaw the creation of Alberta Government Telephones.\n Cushing's resignation in 1910 precipitated the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal, which forced Rutherford's resignation.  Though Cushing had hopes of being asked to replace Rutherford, that role fell instead to Arthur Sifton, the province's chief judge.  Left out of Sifton's cabinet, Cushing did not seek re-election in the 1913 election, and did not re-enter politics thereafter.  He was the chairman of Mount Royal College's board of governors for sixteen years.  He died in 1934.",
  "/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway": "The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) (reporting marks CP, CPAA, MILW, SOO), also known formerly as CP Rail between 1968 and 1996, and known as simply Canadian Pacific is a historic Canadian Class I railway incorporated in 1881. The railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001.\n Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, it owns approximately 20,000 kilometres (12,500 mi) of track all across Canada and into the United States, stretching from Montreal to Vancouver, and as far north as Edmonton. Its rail network also serves Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, and New York City in the United States.\n The railway was first built between eastern Canada and British Columbia between 1881 and 1885 (connecting with Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay area lines built earlier), fulfilling a trusty extended to British Columbia when it entered Confederation in 1871. It was Canada's first transcontinental railway, but no longer reaches the Atlantic coast. Primarily a freight railway, the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada. The CPR became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada, a position it held as late as 1975. Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986, after being assumed by Via Rail Canada in 1978. A beaver was chosen as the railway's logo in honour of Sir Donald A Smith (1st. Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal) who had risen from Factor to Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company over a lengthy career in the beaver fur trade. Smith was a principal financier of the C.P.R. staking much of his personal wealth. In 1885, he drove the last spike to complete the transcontinental line.\n The company acquired two American lines in 2009: the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad and the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad. The trackage of the IC&E was at one time part of CP subsidiary Soo Line and predecessor line The Milwaukee Road. The combined DME/ICE system spanned North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Iowa, as well as two short stretches into two other states, which included a line to Kansas City, Missouri, and a line to Chicago, Illinois, and regulatory approval to build a line into the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.

  "/wiki/Deerfoot_Trail": "Deerfoot Trail is a 46.4-kilometre (28.8 mi) freeway segment of Highway 2 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  It stretches the entire length of the city from south to north and links suburbs to downtown via Memorial Drive and 17 Avenue SE.  It also forms part of the CANAMEX Corridor which connects Calgary to Edmonton and Interstate 15 in the United States via Highways 3 and 4.  The freeway begins south of Calgary where it splits from Macleod Trail, crosses the Bow River into city limits, and reaches the Stoney Trail ring road.  Crisscrossing twice more with the river, it intersects Glenmore Trail and Memorial Drive; the former is a major east\u2013west expressway while the latter is a freeway spur into downtown.  In north Calgary, it crosses Highway 1 and passes Calgary International Airport before ending at a second interchange with Stoney Trail.  Highway 2 becomes the Queen Elizabeth II Highway as it continues north into Rocky View County towards Edmonton.\n Originally called Blackfoot Trail Freeway upon the opening of the first section in 1971, it was renamed in 1974 to honour Deerfoot, a late 19th century Siksika Nation (Blackfoot) long distance runner known for his exceptional speed.  Subsequent sections opened in 1975, 1980, 1982 and 2003.  Deerfoot was not entirely a freeway until 2005 when the final of four at-grade intersections in southeast Calgary was converted to an interchange.  Well known for its frequent rush hour congestion and collisions, traffic levels have steadily increased as Calgary's population has tripled to over 1.2 million since 1971.  The mostly six-lane freeway is Alberta's busiest road with volume nearing 169,000 vehicles per day between Highway 1 and Memorial Drive in 2018, more than twice that for which it was designed.  The province of Alberta has been fiscally responsible for the road since 2000 but now seeks to offload maintenance and future improvement costs to the city of Calgary.  The two parties remain at odds over who should operate the road in the long-term but began a joint study in 2016 that has continued into 2019. It offered five short-term recommendations in 2017 and by the end of 2019 will present a long-term strategy for upgrades. In March 2019, Alberta committed $478 million to Deerfoot Trail improvements; the work is scheduled to begin in 2023.",

In Edmonton, it is briefly concurrent with freeway sections of Highways 216 and 16 before bisecting the city of St. Albert and reverting to two lanes en route to Athabasca.
