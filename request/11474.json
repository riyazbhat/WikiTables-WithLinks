  "/wiki/List_of_Washington_Redskins_players": "This is a list of American football players who have played for the Washington Redskins, as well as its predecessors the Boston Braves (1932) and Boston Redskins (1933\u20131936), in the National Football League (NFL).  It includes players that have played at least five games in the NFL regular season.[a]  The Washington Redskins franchise was founded in Boston, Massachusetts as the Boston Braves, named after the local baseball franchise.  The name was changed the next year to the Redskins.  In 1937, the franchise moved to Washington, D.C.\n The Redskins have played over 1,000 games.  In those games, the club won five professional American football championships including two NFL Championships and three Super Bowls.  The franchise captured ten NFL divisional titles and six NFL conference championships.\n Overall, the Redskins have had a total of 23 players and coaches (17 primary, six minor)[b] inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Many Redskins players have also had successful college football careers, including six who were Heisman Trophy winners:  Gary Beban, Desmond Howard, Vic Janowicz, George Rogers, Danny Wuerffel, and Robert Griffin III.  In addition, the Heisman Trophy sculpture was modeled after Ed Smith in 1934, who became a Redskins player in 1936.\n Several former players have become head coach of the Redskins, including Turk Edwards, Dick Todd, and Jack Pardee. In addition, former players have become assistant coaches, such as Earnest Byner, Russ Grimm, Greg Manusky, and Keenan McCardell.  Other players have also become successful in non-sport activities, like acting (Terry Crews and Jamal Duff) and politics (Tom Osborne and Heath Shuler).\n Players on the Redskins have also been related from time to time.  In 1957, Redskins end Joe Walton became the first son of an NFL player to play in the league.  His father, Frank Walton also played on the Redskins.  Joe Krakoski and his son, also named Joe Krakoski, also both played for the Redskins.  In addition, four sets of brothers have played with each other while on the Redskins: Chris and Nic Clemons, Cecil and Ray Hare, Ed and Robert Khayat, and Dan and Matt Turk."
