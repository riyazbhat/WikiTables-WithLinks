Unlike a true roller coaster, the train is powered through the entire course, rather than being allowed to coast after an initial lift or launch.

  "/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster (also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track, taking tight, flat turns (without banking) at modest speeds, yet producing high lateral G-forces. The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops, the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces. When approaching a turn from a straight section, the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight, and thus plunge off of the device, this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach. Almost all Wild Mice feature \"switchback\" sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections. Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0, but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating). Some riders, usually among taller people, report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns.[citation needed]",
