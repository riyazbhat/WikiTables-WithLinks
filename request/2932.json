  "/wiki/Starting_price": "In horse racing, the starting price (SP) is the odds prevailing on a particular horse in the on-course fixed-odds betting market at the time a race begins. The method by which SPs are set for each runner varies in different countries but is generally by consensus of an appointed panel on the basis of their observations of the fluctuation in prices at the racetrack. This is done as follows: \n For each horse the odds offered by the bookmakers are ordered into a list from longest to shortest. This list is then divided into two equal halves and the SP is the shortest odds available in the half containing the longest odds. Thus the SP or a longer price will have been offered by at least half the bookmakers in the sample. Note: This method is slightly different from the method of calculating the median. The principal function of a starting price is to determine returns on those winning bets where fixed odds have not been taken at the time the bet was struck. Typically, on the day of the race, UK bookmakers offer a choice between placing a bet at SP, or taking a fixed price. When viewing future races, SP may be the only option available. Some bookmakers offer best odds guaranteed, meaning that if a punter takes fixed odds on a race when the bet is struck and the SP turns out to be better (that is, higher), then if the punter wins, the payout is calculated using the SP. This is aimed at removing hesitancy among punters prompted by fears of taking what might prove to be a poor (that is, low) price before the race. In the United Kingdom, the stake on an SP bet is returned if the horse is withdrawn before the race starts.",

Bobbyjo was owned by Bobby Burke Mullaghmore, Co. Galway. Humble Beginnings\n In 1991, Bobby Burke and his brother Eugene, who was breeding horses himself, met in Galway with businessman and auctioneer Liam Mulryan. They bought six horses from Liam. One was named Bobbyjo and spent the next few years at Eugene's farm in Mullaghmore before being sent for training with Tommy Carberry in July 1995. Bobbyjo was an Irish bred racehorse by Bustineto and Markup. The name Boobyjo was created by joining Bobby's name with that of his wife Jo. Grand National Success\n Bobbyjo arrived at Aintree having won the Irish Grand National in 1998, however this was not regarded at the time as a good pointe to Grand National success as Irish trained runners had failed to win the race for twenty-four years. On the day Bobbyjo was the subject of a huge gamble that saw him sent off at the short odds of 10/1 with Paul Carberry, the son of the trainer Tommy in the saddle. As coincidence had it, Tommy had been the rider twenty-four years earlier, the last time an Irish trained runner had won the race. The victory signalled an upturn in fortunes for Irish trained runners in the decade that followed, though he himself completed the course well beaten when defending his crown in 1999. Death of Bobbyjo\n Bobbyjo broke a knee at Fairyhouse Racecourse in February 2001 and had to be put down one month later due to his incurable injuries.",

  "/wiki/Papillon_(horse)": "Papillon (1991 - 2017) was an Irish racehorse formerly trained at Greenhills stables, in Kill, County Kildare. His most notable success was winning the 2000 Grand National. Papillon was owned by American Mrs Betty Moran, owner of Brushwood Stable. She was not a fan of the Grand National and it took considerable persuasion before she would allow Papillon to be entered for the race in 2000. Papillon had started the day with odds of 33-1 but was backed down to 10-1 by the time the race began. He was a first ever ride in the race for 20-year-old jockey Ruby Walsh, and was trained by Ruby's father Ted Walsh. When Papillon crossed the finishing line to win the world's richest steeplechase he became an instant punters' favourite. Papillon previously came a very close second in the 1998 Irish Grand National to Bobbyjo under top-weight. In 2001 Papillon returned to Aintree to attempt to defend his winning record. However, conditions were completely different from the previous year, as the race was run on very heavy ground and Papillon carried more weight. He was brought down at the 19th fence but Ruby Walsh realised there would be very few completions and remounted the horse to finish last of the four finishers, earning \u00a325,000 for doing so. Papillon was retired at the end of the 2002/03 season, having earned his connections over \u00a3400,000 in win and place prize money.",

Monty's Pass was bred in 1993 by Montelimar in Ireland and began racing in point-to-points before turning to chasing, finishing fifth in the Mildmay of Fleet chase at Cheltenham and second in the Topham Chase over the Grand National fences in 2002 before landing over \u00a3200,000 for his owners when winning the Kerry National. The horse was lightly raced over hurdles in preparation for the 2003 Grand National in order to protect his handicap and was the subject of a huge gamble by the public on the day of the race, which saw his price tumble from 40/1 to 16/1 at the off. The horse won in what was considered by racing pundits to be one of the strongest Grand National fields of the previous two decades, landing a huge gamble of over \u00a31 million for his owners in the process. His partner in victory, Barry Geraghty, later said of the race, I couldn't believe how easily he did it, he jumped like a cat all the way, it was fantastic! Trainer, Jimmy Mangan said, That was unbelievable, he did everything right. He travelled well all the way and after he passed me with a round to go I said to myself he could win!
