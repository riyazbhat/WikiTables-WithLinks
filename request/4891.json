  "/wiki/Married..._with_Children": "Married... with Children is an American television sitcom that aired on Fox, created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt. Originally broadcast from April 5, 1987 to June 9, 1997, it is the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on Fox and the first to be broadcast in the network's primetime slot. One episode was broadcast on FX on June 18, 2002.\n The show follows the suburban Chicago lives of Al Bundy, a once-glorious high school football player-turned-hard-luck women's shoe salesman; his lazy wife, Peggy; their attractive, dumb and popular daughter, Kelly; and their smart, horny and unpopular son, Bud. Their neighbors are the upwardly mobile Steve Rhoades and his wife Marcy, who later gets remarried to Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her \"trophy husband\" and Al's sidekick. Most storylines involve Al's schemes being foiled by his own cartoonish dim wit and bad luck.\n The series comprises 259 episodes and 11 seasons. Its theme song is \"Love and Marriage\" by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra from the 1955 television production Our Town.\n The first two seasons of the series were videotaped at ABC Television Center in Hollywood. From season three to season eight, the show was taped at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, and the remaining three seasons were taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. The series was produced by Embassy Communications during its first season and half of its second season and the remaining seasons by ELP Communications under the studio Columbia Pictures Television.\n In 2008, the show placed number 94 on Entertainment Weekly's \"New TV Classics\" list.",
  "/wiki/Hood_'n_the_Boyz": "This is a list of episodes for the eighth season (1993\u201394) of the television series Married... with Children.\n This season introduces many of Al's friends, including Aaron, Bob Rooney and Officer Dan (though Officer Dan was not a character in the earlier seasons, the actor who played him also appeared in \"Rock 'n Roll Girl\" as the sheriff who issued Al a ticket for an insulting bumper sticker, \"Weenie Tot Lovers and Other Strangers\" as the police officer who arrested Al, and \"The Egg and I\" as the FBI agent searching for Steve). Al, Jefferson, Bob Rooney, and Officer Dan (along with Griff and Ike, who are introduced in season 9) all become members of NO MA'AM in the episode where the men fight back against a talk show host (played by Jerry Springer) known as \"The Masculine Feminist\". This is also the season where Bud joins a fraternity. The closest explanation for Seven's mysterious disappearance 14 months before is in the episode \"Ride Scare\", where a closeup on a carton of milk reveals a picture of Seven with the word \"Missing\".  Al's plus-sized model friends simply look at it without comment before helping themselves.",
  "/wiki/Dave's_World": "Dave's World is an American sitcom television series created by Fred Barron, that aired on CBS from September 20, 1993 to June 20, 1997. The series is based on the writing of Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry.",
  "/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer is  an American supernatural drama television series based on the 1992 film of the same name. It was created by Joss Whedon under his production tag, Mutant Enemy Productions, with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson, David Fury, David Greenwalt, Doug Petrie, Marti Noxon, and David Solomon.\n The series premiered on March 10, 1997, on The WB and concluded on May 20, 2003, on UPN. The series narrative follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"Slayers\". In the story, Slayers or the 'Chosen Ones' are \"called\" (chosen by fate) to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n The series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings. Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.\n The success of Buffy has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including novels, comics, and video games. The series has received attention in fandom (including fan films), parody, and academia, and has influenced the direction of other television series. The series, as well as its spinoff series Angel, and extensions thereof, have been collectively termed the \"Buffyverse\". As of 2018, a spin-off \"sequel\" of the series is being developed for television, with Monica Owusu-Breen as showrunner.",
  "/wiki/Xander_Harris": "Alexander Lavelle Harris is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997\u20132003). He was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed throughout the television series by Nicholas Brendon and in two episodes by his twin brother, Kelly Donovan. He was conceived as an everyman and a male character for series heroine Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to interact with, and to provide comic relief in the series. Xander is one of several friends of Buffy who assist her in saving the world against numerous supernatural events that plague Sunnydale, California, a town built over a doorway to hell.\n Xander is based in part on Whedon himself, particularly in his high school years; as such, he is often the most geeky as well as witty and verbose of Buffy's characters. The character's overriding arc through the series has been his struggle towards maturity and earning the respect of others. In the canonical comic book continuation of the series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight (2007\u20132011), Xander comes to achieve these goals in becoming the tactical leader of a global army of Vampire Slayers alongside Buffy.\n Academic attention to the character has frequently come in the form of gender studies or with a focus on social class, reflecting Xander's working class home life and his fears of inadequacy. However, Xander's unique position as both outside and within the main group enhances his insight into the other characters, especially as the series continues; in Season Eight, he is Buffy's unofficial \"Watcher\", who watches over her and has a clear perspective. Critics have noted that although Xander frequently exhibits a struggle of masculinity, his storylines often focus on his romantic conquests. Following his unreciprocated love for Buffy, these include the tumultuous relationship with rich girl Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), brief fling with his best friend Willow (Alyson Hannigan) prior to her coming out, and his long-term relationship with ex-demon Anya (Emma Caulfield). \nIn Season Eight, the character's older-brother relationship with Buffy's little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) also develops along romantic lines, too late for Buffy to realize her compatibility with Xander.\n The character of Xander Harris also appears in numerous items in the series Expanded Universe, such as comic books, tie-in novels and video games.",
