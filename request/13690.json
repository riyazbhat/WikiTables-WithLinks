It is the fifth-largest park in New York City by area, covering 843 acres (3.41 km2). Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 37.5\u201338 million visitors annually, as well as one of the most filmed locations in the world. Following proposals for a large park in Manhattan during the 1840s, Central Park was first approved in 1853 as a 778-acre (3.15 km2) park. In 1857, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and architect/landscape designer Calvert Vaux won a design competition to construct the park with a plan they titled the Greensward Plan. Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1876. After a period of decline in the early 20th century, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park.",
