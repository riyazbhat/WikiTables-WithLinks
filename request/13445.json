  "/wiki/Appleton_City_Hall": "Appleton City Hall is a historic municipal building in Appleton, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1895 as one of the few monumental 19th-century buildings in rural western Minnesota. It initially housed Appleton's government offices, fire department, and jail on the ground floor and an auditorium on the upper floor. The city hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for supposedly being an example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture and for its long service as a local government and community center.

  "/wiki/Richardsonian_Romanesque": "Richardsonian Romanesque is a style of Romanesque Revival architecture named after architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838\u20131886). The revival style incorporates 11th and 12th century southern French, Spanish and Italian Romanesque characteristics. Richardson first used elements of the style in his Richardson Olmsted Complex in Buffalo, New York, designed in 1870. Multiple architects followed in this style in the late 1800s; Richardsonian Romanesque later influenced modern styles of architecture as well.",
  "/wiki/Christ_Episcopal_Church_(Benson,_Minnesota)": "Christ Episcopal Church is a historic church building in Benson, Minnesota, United States. It is Benson's oldest church, built in 1879 as part of the Episcopal Church's ambitious expansion into western Minnesota under Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as Christ Church-Episcopal for having local significance in the themes of architecture and religion. It was nominated for its association with Bishop Whipple's missionary program, for symbolizing Benson's English and New Englander settlers, for being Benson's oldest church building, and for its early Gothic Revival architecture. Its board and batten walls, side-entry bell tower, and lancet windows and door are all typical of Carpenter Gothic architecture. The congregation sold the building in 1966 to make way for construction of a high-rise apartment. The 87-year-old church building escaped demolition; it was moved south across the road (at which point it was rotated 180\u00b0 to maintain its street-facing fa\u00e7ade). It was repurposed as a senior center.",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival (also referred to as Victorian Gothic, neo-Gothic, or Gothick) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England. Its momentum grew in the early 19th century, when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture, in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time. Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style, including decorative patterns, finials, lancet windows, hood moulds and label stops. The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England, gaining ground in the 19th. Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism. Ultimately, the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century. Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original, sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods. In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England, interest spread to the rest of Europe, Australia, Sierra Leone, South Africa and to the Americas; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide.",

  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture (sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes. Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque. Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate, or when many French Baroque features are present (Second Empire). The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English Wollaton Hall, Italian Palazzo Pitti, the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, and the Russian Palace of Facets\u2014all deemed Renaissance\u2014illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.",

  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939. It responded to needs for relief, reform, and recovery from the Great Depression. Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), the Farm Security Administration (FSA), the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). They provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth and the elderly. The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs: relief for the unemployed and poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression. The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969) with its base in liberal ideas, the South, traditional[clarification needed] Democrats, big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites.",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic \u2013 sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture \u2013 is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service (NPS) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment. Since its founding in 1916, the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings. The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world, reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture. Architects, landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes. Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures, including entrance gateways, hotels and lodges, park roads and bridges, visitor centers, trail shelters, informational kiosks, and even mundane maintenance and support facilities.
