  "/wiki/USS_Dolphin_(1836)": "The third USS Dolphin was a brig in the United States Navy. Her plans were the basis of other brigs of that time. She was named for the aquatic mammal. She was launched on 17 June 1836 at New York Navy Yard, and commissioned on 6 September 1836. She sailed on 6 October under the command of Lieutenant W. E. McKenney to join the Brazil Squadron after a short cruise on the coast of Africa. She joined her squadron on 21 February 1837 and was employed in the waters along the Atlantic coast of South America to protect the rights and property of American citizens. She set sail from Bahia, Brazil on 17 April 1839, and arrived at New York City on 16 May, where she was decommissioned on 25 May. Dolphin made two cruises off the coast of Africa to suppress the slave trade from 18 December 1839 - 14 July 1840 and again from 5 November 1840 - 25 May 1841. On 7 September, she sailed to join the newly organized Home Squadron cruising on the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies. Aside from a repair period at New York from 31 December 1841 - 4 March 1842, she served with the Home Squadron until October 1843. Dolphin lay at Norfolk, Virginia until 13 November 1845, when she sailed to join the African Squadron, returning to New York on 5 November 1847. She got underway on 6 May 1848 to join the East India Squadron, protecting American citizens in Asiatic waters.",
  "/wiki/Cuba": "Cuba (/\u02c8kju\u02d0b\u0259/ (listen); Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8ku\u03b2a]), officially the Republic of Cuba (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica de Cuba (help\u00b7info)), is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet. It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula (Mexico), south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey. The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers (42,800 sq mi) (109,884 square kilometers (42,426 sq mi) without the territorial waters). The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean, with an area of 105,006 square kilometers (40,543 sq mi), and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century. From the 15th century, it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Open corruption and oppression under Batista's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba. The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.",

Crusader was heavily armed and was used in a gunboat diplomacy role when the United States needed to place political pressure on Paraguay. After completing that mission, she returned to the United States to participate as a gunboat in the blockade of the Confederate States of America.",
  "/wiki/Havana": "Havana (/h\u0259\u02c8v\u00e6n\u0259/; Spanish: La Habana [la a\u02c8\u03b2ana] (listen)) is the capital city, largest city, province, major port, and leading commercial center of Cuba. The city has a population of 2.1 million inhabitants, and it spans a total of 781.58 km2 (301.77 sq mi) - making it the largest city by area, the most populous city, and the fourth largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region. The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain. The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592. Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city. The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish-American War. The city is the center of the Cuban government, and home to various ministries, headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices. The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third highest income in the country. Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Mari melena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay."
