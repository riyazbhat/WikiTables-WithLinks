  "/wiki/Antioch_College": "Antioch College is a private liberal arts college in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection, the college began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution; politician and education reformer Horace Mann became its first president. It was the founding, constituent college of Antioch University System, which Antioch College remained a part of from 1978 until 2008 when it closed. Thereafter, a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name Antioch College. The college remained closed for three years before reopening in 2011 as an independent institution. Antioch is one of only a few liberal-arts institutions in the United States featuring a cooperative education work program mandatory for all students. Democracy and shared governance, especially as a means to activism and social justice, are at the heart of the college. Since 1921 Antioch's educational approach has blended practical work experience with classroom learning, and participatory community governance.",

  "/wiki/Ballard_Road_Covered_Bridge": "The Ballard Road Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Built in the late nineteenth century and since bypassed, the bridge has been named a historic site. Following a design by H.E. Hebble, James E. Brown built the bridge across Caesar's Creek in 1883. He chose to name it for a nearby industrialist, Lyman Ballard, who had constructed a water-powered mill on the creek to grind grain approximately thirty years before. Brown chose a seven-panel Howe truss design for the bridge, which measures 80 feet (24 m) in length. Built of wood with iron elements on abutments of limestone and covered with a metal roof, the single-span bridge is covered with vertical siding and retains the original square shape of its portals. Much of Greene County is underlain by high-quality limestone (the McDonald Farm near Xenia supplied limestone for the Washington Monument) and from this limestone the bridge's abutments were taken; it appears that the quarries for the abutments were located elsewhere in the surrounding New Jasper Township.",

  "/wiki/Bank_of_Xenia": "The Bank of Xenia is a historic former bank building in downtown Xenia, Ohio, United States. Built in 1835, it was the location of Greene County's first bank, which opened on June 1 of that year. For thirty years, the building was used as a bank, becoming the local branch of the State Bank of Ohio in 1846 and changing its name to First National Bank in 1863. After First National moved to a newer building in 1865, it was no longer used as a bank; among its later owners was A.C. Messenger, a physician who used it as his home and office. In the 1880s, the bank was a party to a lawsuit known as Xenia Bank v. Stewart, which was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1885. Built in a heavily Greek Revival style of architecture, upon a stone foundation, the bank is a two-story structure constructed with a rectangular plan. Located along Detroit Street in downtown Xenia, its pilastered appearance is dominated by the entrance porch, which features two columns built in the Doric order. Above the columns is a small second-story balcony, which is protected by a wrought iron railing; the frieze on the balcony's side includes both metopes and triglyphs that alternate in a classical style.",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States. It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the Greek temple, with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency. A product of Hellenism, it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture, which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture. The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 1842. With a newfound access to Greece, or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites, archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders. In each country it touched, the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue, and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy, two countries where the style never really took hold. This was especially the case in Britain, Germany and the United States, where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations. The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design, sometimes called Neo-Grec, was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century, when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical, Empire, Russian Empire, and Regency architecture in Britain.",

A great-nephew of Charles Thomson, secretary of the First Continental Congress, Alexander enlisted in the Continental Army at the age of nineteen. Fighting under the command of Nathanael Greene, Berryhill was wounded as his company was captured at the Battle of Guilford Court House. After two years as a prisoner of war, he was released in a prisoner exchange and returned home. Having married, he moved to Ohio in 1814 with his family.

When Cedarville's was built, the opera house as an institution was a center of social life in rural Ohio: the public sphere was nearly nonexistent except for the village opera house, which typically served as a meeting place for travelling vaudeville acts, political events, musical performances, and graduation ceremonies.  Because the first floor has always been used as offices for the various organizations that used the building, public events were typically held on the second floor, which has been little modified by the years; it is one of Ohio's least changed historic performance halls.\n In 1984, the Cedarville Opera House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in local history.

Born in Ireland circa 1790, Alexander Conner emigrated from Ireland to the United States in young adulthood, and he settled in Xenia in 1816. Engaging in business there, he became prosperous enough to purchase a lot southeast of the county courthouse after twenty years of life in the city. On this lot he erected three buildings facing the street; they are the front portions of the present rowhouse. The rear two buildings were completed between that time and his 1865 death, upon which event the rowhouse was sold. The street-facing portions of the rowhouse are architecturally important to the city of Xenia: although the western and central buildings are Federal and the eastern is Greek Revival, they are together a typical example of housing found in many communities of southwestern Ohio before the Civil War of the 1860s.",

The Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern United States and the Western United States. As American wages grew much higher than those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, the period saw an influx of millions of European immigrants.

In 1904\u201305, the brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III. The Wright brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving the flying problem.
