  "/wiki/Antioch_College": "Antioch College is a private liberal arts college in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  Founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection, the college began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution; politician and education reformer Horace Mann became its first president. It was the founding, constituent college of Antioch University System, which Antioch College remained a part of from 1978 until 2008 when it closed. Thereafter, a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name \"Antioch College\".  The college remained closed for three years before reopening in 2011 as an independent institution.\n Antioch is one of only a few liberal-arts institutions in the United States featuring a cooperative education work program mandatory for all students. Democracy and shared governance, especially as a means to activism and social justice, are at the heart of the college. Since 1921 Antioch's educational approach has blended practical work experience with classroom learning, and participatory community governance. Students receive narrative evaluations and academic letter grades.\n Antioch College is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, the Global Liberal Arts Alliance, and the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education. The college has produced two Nobel Prize winners. Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, the 1996 laureate for Peace, obtained his Master of Arts at Antioch in 1984.

  "/wiki/Ballard_Road_Covered_Bridge": "The Ballard Road Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Built in the late nineteenth century and since bypassed, the bridge has been named a historic site.\n Following a design by H.E. Hebble, James E. Brown built the bridge across Caesar's Creek in 1883.  He chose to name it for a nearby industrialist, Lyman Ballard, who had constructed a water-powered mill on the creek to grind grain approximately thirty years before.  Brown chose a seven-panel Howe truss design for the bridge, which measures 80 feet (24\u00a0m) in length.  Built of wood with iron elements on abutments of limestone and covered with a metal roof, the single-span bridge is covered with vertical siding and retains the original square shape of its portals.  Much of Greene County is underlain by high-quality limestone (the McDonald Farm near Xenia supplied limestone for the Washington Monument) and from this limestone the bridge's abutments were taken; it appears that the quarries for the abutments were located elsewhere in the surrounding New Jasper Township.\n Although the Ballard Road Bridge remains in its original rural setting, its surroundings are no longer as quiet as originally; U.S. Route 35 has been constructed as a controlled-access highway immediately to the south, and Ballard Road now dead-ends at the bridge.  By the 1970s, it was one of just eighteen Howe truss covered bridges remaining in Ohio, although thousands of bridges were built to this design in the 19th century throughout the United States.  As such, it was deemed historically significant enough to qualify to be added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.  The Ballard Road Bridge is one of five covered bridges in Greene County, and the only one open to road traffic.",

  "/wiki/Bank_of_Xenia": "The Bank of Xenia is a historic former bank building in downtown Xenia, Ohio, United States.  Built in 1835, it was the location of Greene County's first bank, which opened on June 1 of that year.  For thirty years, the building was used as a bank, becoming the local branch of the State Bank of Ohio in 1846 and changing its name to First National Bank in 1863.  After First National moved to a newer building in 1865, it was no longer used as a bank; among its later owners was A.C. Messenger, a physician who used it as his home and office.  In the 1880s, the bank was a party to a lawsuit known as Xenia Bank v. Stewart, which was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1885.\n Built in a heavily Greek Revival style of architecture, upon a stone foundation, the bank is a two-story structure constructed with a rectangular plan.  Located along Detroit Street in downtown Xenia, its pilastered appearance is dominated by the entrance porch, which features two columns built in the Doric order.  Above the columns is a small second-story balcony, which is protected by a wrought iron railing; the frieze on the balcony's side includes both metopes and triglyphs that alternate in a classical style.\n In 1973, the Bank of Xenia was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States. It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the Greek temple, with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency.  A product of Hellenism, it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture, which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture. The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 1842.\n With a newfound access to Greece, or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites, archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders.  In each country it touched, the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue, and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy, two countries where the style never really took hold. This was especially the case in Britain, Germany and the United States, where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations.\n The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design, sometimes called Neo-Grec, was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century, when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical, Empire, Russian Empire, and Regency architecture in Britain. Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries, lasting until the Civil War in America (1860s) and even later in Scotland.",

  "/wiki/Berryhill-Morris_House": "The Berryhill-Morris House is a historic farmhouse near the city of Bellbrook in Greene County, Ohio, United States.  Built in the 1830s for an elderly veteran, it has changed little since its early years, and it has been named a historic site.\n Berryhills were among the pioneers of Sugarcreek Township, starting when Alexander and Rachel Berryhill moved from Virginia.  A great-nephew of Charles Thomson, secretary of the First Continental Congress, Alexander enlisted in the Continental Army at the age of nineteen.  Fighting under the command of Nathanael Greene, Berryhill was wounded as his company was captured at the Battle of Guilford Court House.  After two years as a prisoner of war, he was released in a prisoner exchange and returned home.  Having married, he moved to Ohio in 1814 with his family.  He became the patriarch of one of the township's premier old families, composed of eleven children, including a prominent Old School Presbyterian minister.  His property was inherited by his son Samuel, who continued farming until dying in 1840.  Eighteen years later, the Morris family purchased the property and began a tenure of over a century.\n Built in 1832, the Berryhill-Morris House is a two-story building in the Federal style.  Both the walls and the foundation are brick, and it possesses an asphalt roof and elements of stone.  Its floor plan is that of a rectangular central-passage house, and it sits amid a farm of approximately 100 acres (40\u00a0ha) that retains its original rural appearance.

The 88 ABW operates the airfield, maintains all infrastructure and provides security, communications, medical, legal, personnel, contracting, finance, transportation, air traffic control, weather forecasting, public affairs, recreation and chaplain services for more than 60 associate units.\n The base's origins begin with the establishment of Wilbur Wright Field on 22 May and McCook Field in November 1917, both established by the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps as World War I installations. McCook was used as a testing field and for aviation experiments. Wright was used as a flying field (renamed Patterson Field in 1931); Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot; armorers' school, and a temporary storage depot. McCook's functions were transferred to Wright Field when it was closed in October 1927. Wright-Patterson AFB was established in 1948 as a merger of Patterson and Wright Fields.\n In 1995, negotiations to end the Bosnian War were held at the base, resulting in the Dayton Agreement that ended the war.\n The 88th Air Base Wing is commanded by Col.

Built in 1836, this two-story brick building is a physical merger of six buildings constructed in the Greek Revival and Federal styles of architecture.  It is built in the shape of the letter \"U,\" with three buildings facing the street and two to the rear.\n Born in Ireland circa 1790, Alexander Conner emigrated from Ireland to the United States in young adulthood, and he settled in Xenia in 1816.  Engaging in business there, he became prosperous enough to purchase a lot southeast of the county courthouse after twenty years of life in the city.  On this lot he erected three buildings facing the street; they are the front portions of the present rowhouse.

  "/wiki/Dean_Family_Farm": "The Dean Family Farm, listed since 1975 as a historic site on the National Register of Historic Places, has its origins with the immigration of Daniel Dean, a native of Tobermore, County Londonderry, Ireland, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1784 when he was aged 18, according to Dean family histories. Daniel was a son of George Roger Dean, who fought in the Colonial line, and Mary Campbell who was reared with her sister by the Duke of Argyl at Inveraray Scotland, the clan Campbells' ancestral home.[citation needed]\n The National Register and an Ohio Historic Inventory, dated 11 October 1974, list the historic site at 199 N. Ballard Road, Xenia, as having five buildings dating from the 1820s on 157 acres (0.6\u00a0km2) along Caesar's Creek in Greene County, Ohio.  The National Register listing was expanded by a boundary increase adding 199 Ballard in 1994, and renaming as the Dean Family Farm Historic District.\n Daniel Dean, born October 20, 1766 in Ireland was a son of George Roger Dean, whom DAR archival records list as a Pennsylvania sergeant and militiaman in the 1770s, along with his elder brothers James and David Dean. A weaver by trade, Daniel Dean lived briefly in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia before meeting and marrying Jannet \"Jenny\" Steele (1768-November 18, 1841), a Scots-Irish girl of Steele's Tavern in Augusta County, Virginia. The couple relocated near Mount Sterling, Kentucky, where Dean built a mill, a house for the couple and another for his sister and mother, both named Mary, whom he brought from Ireland to Kentucky via Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1790.\n Daniel and Jannet had the first of their 11 children while in Kentucky. But when Ohio became a free state in 1803, Dean, an ardent abolitionist, scouted out the new lands north of the Ohio River with his brother-in-law, Henry Barnes, a skilled builder whose son later would become Greene County's wartime sheriff and treasurer. Dean, shortly thereafter, bought 2,000 acres (8.1\u00a0km2) on Caesar's Creek near the settlement of Xenia, but he spent several years litigating to perfect his title. Once his title was secure, Dean joined Barnes and their families in relocating via Fort Washington (later Cincinnati) to Greene County in September 1812. They first dined using as a table a huge, flat rock\u2014then began a lucrative business in which Dean harvested and milled timber for lumber used by Barnes to build homes in and near Xenia, Ohio. Dean's son, Joseph (1804\u201383), wed Hannah Boggs (1809\u201388)and, according to Dean Family records, Joseph built the first substantial two-story home on the family farm in 1823, a house that still stands.\n Daniel Dean, descended from Covenanter Presbyterians, was a church stalwart. At least 36 of his 111 progeny enlisted and served honorably in the Union Army during the Civil War, according to records read at an 1880 Dean family picnic and reported in The Xenia Gazette of Friday, August 20, 1880.[citation needed] The elder Dean, who died January 24, 1843, at age 77, is buried alongside his wife, Jannet, in the Dean Family Cemetery in New Jasper Township.

  "/wiki/Gilded_Age": "In United States history, the Gilded Age was an era that occurred during the late 19th century, from the 1870s to about 1900. The Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern United States and the Western United States. As American wages grew much higher than those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, the period saw an influx of millions of European immigrants. The rapid expansion of industrialization led to a real wage growth of 60%, between 1860 and 1890, and spread across the ever-increasing labor force. The average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880, to $564 in 1890, a gain of 48%. Conversely, the Gilded Age was also an era of abject poverty and inequality, as millions of immigrants\u2014many from impoverished regions\u2014poured into the United States, and the high concentration of wealth became more visible and contentious.\nRailroads were the major growth industry, with the factory system, mining, and finance increasing in importance. Immigration from Europe, and the eastern states, led to the rapid growth of the West, based on farming, ranching, and mining. Labor unions became increasingly important in the rapidly growing industrial cities. Two major nationwide depressions\u2014the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893\u2014interrupted growth and caused social and political upheavals. The South, after the Civil War, remained economically devastated; its economy became increasingly tied to commodities, cotton, and tobacco production, which suffered from low prices. With the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877, African-American people in the South were stripped of political power and voting rights, and were left economically disadvantaged.\n The political landscape was notable in that despite some corruption, election turnout was very high and national elections saw two evenly matched parties. The dominant issues were cultural (especially regarding prohibition, education, and ethnic or racial groups) and economic (tariffs and money supply). With the rapid growth of cities, political machines increasingly took control of urban politics. In business, powerful nationwide trusts formed in some industries. Unions crusaded for the eight-hour working day, and the abolition of child labor; middle class reformers demanded civil service reform, prohibition of liquor and beer, and women's suffrage. Local governments across the North and West built public schools chiefly at the elementary level; public high schools started to emerge. The numerous religious denominations were growing in membership and wealth, with Catholicism becoming the largest. They all expanded their missionary activity to the world arena. Catholics, Lutherans, and Episcopalians set up religious schools and the larger of those set up numerous colleges, hospitals, and charities. Many of the problems faced by society, especially the poor, gave rise to attempted reforms in the subsequent Progressive Era.\n The \"Gilded Age\" term came into use in the 1920s and 1930s and was derived from writer Mark Twain's and Charles Dudley Warner's 1873 novel The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, which satirized an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding. The early half of the Gilded Age roughly coincided with the mid-Victorian era in Britain and the Belle \u00c9poque in France. Its beginning, in the years after the American Civil War, overlaps the Reconstruction Era (which ended in 1877). It was followed in the 1890s by the Progressive Era.",

In 1904\u201305, the brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III. The Wright brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible.\n The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving \"the flying problem\". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines. Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers. Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.\n The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice. From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.\n The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties. Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators. Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that they were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry.",
