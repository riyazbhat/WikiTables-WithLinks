It features men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles; junior's championships; and wheelchair, legends, and exhibition events. Prior to 1988 it was played on grass courts, but since then three types of hardcourt surfaces have been used at Melbourne Park \u2013 green coloured Rebound Ace up to 2007, blue Plexicushion from 2008 to 2019, and blue GreenSet since 2020.\n First held in 1905 as the Australasian championships, the Australian Open has grown to become one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere. Nicknamed \"the happy slam\" and often referred to as the \"Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific\" the tournament is the highest attended Grand Slam event, with more than 812,000 people attending the 2020 tournament.

  "/wiki/Margaret_Court": "Margaret Court AO MBE (n\u00e9e Smith; born 16 July 1942), also known as Margaret Smith Court, is a retired Australian tennis player and former world No. 1. She amassed more major titles than any other player in history and is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. She is currently a Christian minister in Perth, Western Australia.\n In 1970, Court became the first woman during the Open era (and the second woman in history after Maureen Connolly) to win the singles Grand Slam (all four major tournaments in the same calendar year). She won 24 of those titles (11 in the Open era), a record that still stands. She also won 19 women's doubles and 21 mixed doubles titles, giving her a record 64 major titles overall. Her all surfaces (hard, clay, grass and carpet) singles career-winning percentage of 91.74 is the best of all time according to the Sporteology website. Her Open era singles career winning percentage of 91.37% (593\u201356) is unequalled, as is her Open era winning percentage of 91.7% (11\u20131) in Grand Slam finals. Her win-loss performance in all Grand Slam singles tournaments was 90.12% (210\u201323). She was 95.31% (61\u20133) at the Australian Open, 90.38% (47\u20135) at the French Open, 85.10% (51\u20139) at Wimbledon and 89.47% (51\u20136) at the US Open. She also shares the Open era record for most Grand Slam singles titles as a mother with Kim Clijsters. In 1973, Court set the record for most titles won in a single Grand Slam event, with 11 Australian Open wins. This record was surpassed by Rafael Nadal on June 9, 2019 when he won his 12th French Open title.\n Court is one of only three players in history (all women) to have won the \"Grand Slam Boxed Set\", consisting of every Grand Slam title (the singles, doubles and mixed doubles). Court, however, is the only one in tennis history to complete a Multiple Grand Slam set, twice, in all three disciplines: singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. Uniquely, she won all 12 as an amateur and then after a period of retirement, returned as a professional to win all 12 again. Court is also one of only six tennis players to ever win a Multiple Grand Slam set in two disciplines, matching Roy Emerson, Martina Navratilova, Frank Sedgman, Doris Hart and Serena Williams.\n The International Tennis Hall of Fame states: \"For sheer strength of performance and accomplishment there has never been a tennis player to match (her).\" In 2010, the Herald Sun newspaper of Melbourne, Australia called her the greatest female tennis player of all time, a view supported by Evonne Goolagong Cawley.\n Having grown up as a Roman Catholic, Court became associated with Pentecostalism in the 1970s and became a Christian minister in that tradition in 1991. She later founded Margaret Court Ministries.",
