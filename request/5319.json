  "/wiki/Kevin_Sinfield": "Kevin Sinfield, MBE (born 12 September 1980), also known by the nickname of \"King Kev\", is the Director of Rugby, for the Leeds Rhinos in the Super League, and an English former professional rugby league footballer, who captained the Leeds Rhinos in the Super League. His usual position was loose forward, although he sometimes played both stand-off and hooker.\n Sinfield played his entire professional career with Leeds and is one of the most successful players in the Super League history, having captained the team to seven Super League championships and two Challenge Cup successes. He also earned individual accolades as winner of the Lance Todd Trophy (2005), Harry Sunderland Trophy twice (2009, 2012) and the Golden Boot (2012), one of only four British-based players to win the latter. He holds records as the highest points-scorer in Super League history, the third highest points-scorer in British rugby league history, and Leeds' record points scorer. Sinfield is also the only captain to have led a team to win three consecutive Super League titles.\n He won 26 caps for England, who he captained, and 14 caps for Great Britain.\n Sinfield switched to rugby union in 2015 and played one season for Yorkshire Carnegie. After his playing career ended he joined the Rugby Football League as rugby director.",
  "/wiki/Five-eighth": "Five-eighth or Stand-off is one of the positions in a rugby league football team. Wearing jersey number 6, this player is one of the two half backs in a team, partnering the scrum-half.   Sometimes known as the pivot or second receiver, in a traditional attacking 'back-line' (\u2116 1-7) play, the five-eighth would receive the ball from the scrum half, who is the first receiver of the ball from the dummy-half or hooker following a tackle.\n The role of the five-eighth is often to pass the ball away from the congested area around the tackle, further out along the 'back-line' to the outside backs, the centres and wingers, who have more space to run with it. Furthermore, players in this position typically assume responsibility for kicking the ball for field position in general play. The five-eighth is therefore considered one of the most important positions, often referred to as a 'play maker', assuming a decision-making role on the field.  Over time, however, as the game has evolved, the roles of the two halves have grown more aligned and difficult to distinguish.  Along with other key positions \u2013 fullback, hooker and scrum half \u2013 the five-eighth makes up what is known as a team's spine.\n One book published in 1996 stated that in senior rugby league, the five-eighth and hooker handled the ball more often than any other positions.\n The Rugby League International Federation's Laws of the Game state that the \"Stand-off half or Five-eighth\" is to be numbered 6. However, traditionally players' jersey numbers have varied, and in the modern Super League, each squad's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position.",

  "/wiki/Wing": "A wing is a type of fin that produces lift, while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils. A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing. A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.\n Lifting structures used in water, include various foils, such as hydrofoils. Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics. Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines.",

In September 2012, he was named in Hull Kingston Rovers' greatest ever team.",
  "/wiki/Fullback_(rugby_league)": "Fullback (or full-back) is one of the positions in a rugby league football team. Typically wearing jersey number 1, the fullback is a member of the team's 'back-line' (No. 1-7). The position's name comes from their duty of standing the furthest back in defence, behind the forwards (8-13), half backs (6 and 7) and the three-quarter backs (2-5). Fullbacks are therefore the last line of defence, having to tackle any opposition players and regather the ball from any kicks that make it through their teammates. It is for this reason that the fullback is also referred to as the sweeper or custodian. Being able to secure high bomb kicks is a highly sought quality in fullbacks.\n Fullback is also one of the most important positions in attack, handling the ball nearly every set of six and often running into open space on the field. Therefore, together with the two half backs and hooker, fullback is one of the four key positions that make up what is referred to as a team's 'spine'. Because the fullback makes the most support runs, players in the fullback role complete more very high-intensity running than any other position.\n The Rugby League International Federation's Laws of the Game state that the 'fullback' is to be numbered 1. However, traditionally players' jersey numbers have varied, and in the modern Super League, each squad's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position.",

He shone for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage \u2116 1208) again in 2007, playing 25 games and scoring 208 points during 25 appearances.

  "/wiki/Scrum-half_(rugby_league)": "A rugby league team consists of thirteen players on the field, with four substitutes on the bench. Each of the thirteen players is assigned a position, normally with a standardised number, which reflects their role in attack and defence, although players can take up any position at any time.\n Players are divided into two general types, forwards and backs. Forwards are generally chosen for their size and strength. They are expected to run with the ball, to attack, and to make tackles. Forwards are required to improve the team's field position thus creating space and time for the backs. Backs are usually smaller and faster, though a big, fast player can be of advantage in the backs. Their roles require speed and ball-playing skills, rather than just strength, to take advantage of the field position gained by the forwards. Typically forwards tend to operate in the centre of the field, while backs operate nearer to the touch-lines, where more space can usually be found.",
  "/wiki/England_national_rugby_league_team": "The England national rugby league team represents England in international rugby league.\n The team, largely formed from the Great Britain team which also represented Wales, Scotland and Ireland, is run under the auspices of the Rugby Football League. It participates in the Rugby League World Cup, Four Nations and Test matches.\n The team dates to 1904, when they played against a mixture of Welsh and Scottish players in Wigan. Until the 1950s, they regularly toured Australia and New Zealand and played both home and away matches against neighbours Wales and France, but when it was decided that Great Britain would tour the Southern Hemisphere instead of England, France and Wales became the only regular opponents.\n Their first appearance in the Rugby League World Cup was in 1975. They have been three times runners-up; in 1975, 1995 and 2017. England also competed in the European Nations Cup, and, in 2006, an England 'A' team competed for the Federation Shield.\n England's main rivals historically were Wales and France, with the rivalries stretching back to 1908 and 1934 respectively. England's main rivals now are Australia and New Zealand.\n Traditionally a predominantly white kit is worn including white shorts and socks. However the jersey usually features some form of red, like red stripes, crosses or chevrons. These colours are similar to other English sporting teams and are the colours used on the national flag. In 2008, a new kit was introduced featuring a red cross on the front and red strips down the sides of the jersey, shorts and socks were white too with red strips. Also in 2008, the Rugby Football League chose to abandon the traditional English lion on the badge in favour of a much simpler shield and cross design.\n Currently, the team is ranked third in the world, behind New Zealand and Australia. Wayne Bennett is the head coach, and Sean O'Loughlin the captain.\n From 2020, England will compete against Australia for the Rugby League Ashes. Formerly the Ashes were contested between Great Britain and Australia up until 2003."
