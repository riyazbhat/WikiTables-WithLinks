  "/wiki/Michael_Forbes_(farmer)": "Michael Forbes (born circa 1952) is a farmer, part-time salmon fisherman and quarry worker from near Balmedie in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who became known after his refusal to sell his land to billionaire Donald Trump, who was planning to build an extensive luxury golf course complex in the area with assistance from the governing SNP Alex Salmond. Forbes's farm, which is said by Trump to be in a state of disrepair, has the words NO GOLF COURSE painted on a shed. He attracted media attention in the United States for standing up to Trump. Forbes has insisted that he will never sell his land to Trump despite being offered a payment of \u00a3450,000 in addition to a salary of \u00a350,000 per year for an unspecified job. The plans to build the golf complex were rejected in late November 2007 by Aberdeenshire Council but were later called in by the Scottish Government, who gave approval in November 2008. He has been compared to the beachcomber character in the film Local Hero. In August 2011, contractors hired by Trump fenced off a piece of land belonging to Forbes despite Forbes having the title deeds. The Trump Organization at one point threatened to try to use a compulsory purchase order to forcibly remove him and his family from their land.",

By engaging people from diverse backgrounds, they aim to achieve a powerful and educational experience that will promote the work of restoration to wider audiences and lead to increased support for the return of the forest and its species.",
