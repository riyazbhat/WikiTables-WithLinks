  "/wiki/Elizabeth_H._Boyer": "Elizabeth Hall Boyer (born 1952) is an American fantasy author who produced a number of books in the 1980s and early 1990s. Her stories were deeply influenced by Norse mythology, and are set in a fantasy world whose climate and geography resembles that of the Scandinavia of Norse myths. While Norse mythology has been an influence on the fantasy genre, and many authors such as Tolkien and Lewis were influenced by these myths, Boyer's books followed them much more closely. Her stories are characterized by light and dark elves, dwarves, trolls, sorcerers, ley lines, burial mounds, wizards, and so forth. Boyer tended to follow the Norse versions of these story elements closely without much deviation. Boyer's early books are dominated by the theme of the heroic quest. Boyer attended Brigham Young University where she studied English literature and Scandinavian mythology. She was last reported living near Atlanta on a farm, and no longer writing.",
  "/wiki/Norse_mythology": "Norse mythology is the body of myths of the North Germanic peoples, stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia, and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. The source texts mention numerous gods, such as the hammer-wielding, humanity-protecting thunder-god Thor, who relentlessly fights his foes; the one-eyed, raven-flanked god Odin, who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet; the beautiful, sei\u00f0r-working, feathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among the slain; the vengeful, skiing goddess Ska\u00f0i, who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore; the powerful god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land; the god Freyr, whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity; the goddess I\u00f0unn, who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness; the mysterious god Heimdallr, who is born of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth, and possesses a resounding horn; the j\u00f6tunn Loki, who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess Frigg's beautiful son Baldr; and numerous other deities. Most of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the j\u00f6tnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes or family members of the gods. The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central tree, Yggdrasil. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnar\u00f6k when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew.",

Specialized platforms such as arcade games, which present the game in a large, typically coin-operated chassis, were common in the 1980s in video arcades, but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms became available. These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles, as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop, desktop or handheld computing devices.

  "/wiki/The_Absent-Minded_Professor": "The Absent-Minded Professor is a 1961 American comic science fiction family film produced by Walt Disney Productions based on the short story A Situation of Gravity by Samuel W. Taylor originally published in the May 22, 1943 issue of Liberty magazine. The title character was based in part on Hubert Alyea, a professor emeritus of chemistry at Princeton University, who was known as Dr. Boom for his explosive demonstrations. Directed by Robert Stevenson, the film stars Fred MacMurray as Professor Ned Brainard. The film was a huge success at the box office, and two years later became the first Disney film to have a sequel, 1963's Son of Flubber. The original 1961 film was one of the first Disney films to be colorized (for the 1986 video release), and, along with 1959's The Shaggy Dog and 1963's Son of Flubber, it is one of Disney's few black-and-white films to be produced after 1941.",

  "/wiki/MBA": "The Master of Business Administration (MBA or M.B.A.) degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific management. The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business administration such as accounting, applied statistics, business communication, business ethics, business law, business strategy, finance, managerial economics, management, entrepreneurship, marketing, supply-chain management, and operations management in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. Most programs also include elective courses and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example accounting, finance, and marketing. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about forty to sixty credits (sixty to ninety in a quarter system), much higher than the thirty credits (thirty-six to forty-five in a quarter system) typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the Master of Economics, Master of Finance, Master of Accountancy, Master of Science in Marketing and Master of Science in Management. The MBA is a terminal degree and a professional degree. Accreditation bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, executive (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and distance learning students, many with specialized concentrations.",

  "/wiki/Ph.D.": "A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD, Ph.D., or DPhil; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries. PhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fields. As an earned research degree, those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge, normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation, and defend their work against experts in the field. The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor, researcher, or scientist in many fields. Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may, in many jurisdictions, use the title Doctor (often abbreviated Dr or Dr.) with their name, although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field, culture, or society. Those who teach at universities or work in academic, educational, or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation. Alternatively, holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D., PhD, or DPhil (depending on the awarding institution). It is, however, considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time.",
  "/wiki/Charly": "Charly (marketed and stylized as CHA\u042fLY) is a 1968 American drama film, directed and produced by Ralph Nelson, and written by Stirling Silliphant.

Robertson was reprising his previous portrayal of the same role in a 1961 television adaptation, The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon, an episode of the anthology series The United States Steel Hour. The film received positive reviews, and was a success at the box office and, a generation later, in home media sales."
