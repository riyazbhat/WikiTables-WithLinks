  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales, according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in. Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones, but some alternative scales also exist, such as accumulated cyclone energy, the Power Dissipation Index, the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index, and the Hurricane Severity Index.",

Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Tracking westward, the system attained gale-force winds by 18\u00a0March before striking the Cape York Peninsula. After crossing the area, Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development.

By this time, the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22\u00a0March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system.

Cyclone John developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of Australia on 9 December 1999. As it moved to the west and later south as the result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions, the cyclone was able to rapidly intensify. John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category\u00a05 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale, the highest rating possible. Cyclone John later began interacting with a mid\u2013latitude trough, which slightly weakened the cyclone prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December.
