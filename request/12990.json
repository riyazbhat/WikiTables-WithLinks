  "/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) Finals is the championship series for the NBA and the conclusion of its postseason. All Finals have been played in a best-of-seven format, and are contested between the winners of the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference (formerly Divisions before 1970), except in 1950 when the Eastern Division champion faced the winner between the Western and Central Division champions. From 1946 through 1949, when the league was known as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the playoffs were a three-stage tournament where the two semifinal winners played each other in the finals. The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy.\n The current home-and-away format in the NBA Finals is 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 (the team with the better regular-season record plays on their home court in Games 1, 2, 5, and 7), which has been used in 1947\u20131948, 1950\u20131952, 1957\u20131970, 1972\u20131974, 1976\u20131977, 1979\u20131984, and 2014\u2013present. It was previously in a 2\u20133\u20132 format (the team with the better regular season record plays on their home court in Games 1, 2, 6, and 7) during 1949, 1953\u20131955, and 1985\u20132013, in a 1\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131\u20131 format during 1956 and 1971, and in a 1\u20132\u20132\u20131\u20131 format during 1975 and 1978.\n The Eastern Conference/Division leads the Western Conference/Division in series won (39\u201334). The defunct Central Division, in existence during the 1949\u201350 NBA season when the NBA was divided into three divisions and different from the current Central Division created in 1970 when the then existing Eastern Division was upgraded as a conference, won one championship. The Boston Celtics and the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers alone own almost half of the titles, having won a combined 33 of 73 championships. As of 2019[update], the defending champions are the Toronto Raptors, making history as the first team from outside of the United States to win.",
  "/wiki/List_of_San_Antonio_Spurs_seasons": "The San Antonio Spurs are a professional basketball team based in San Antonio that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 1967, the franchise was founded in Dallas, Texas as the Dallas Chaparrals--one of the eleven charter franchises of the American Basketball Association (ABA). During the 1970\u201371 season, in an attempt to make the team a regional one, the franchise renamed itself the Texas Chaparrals; also, some home games were played in Fort Worth and Lubbock. However, low attendance figures prompted the team to return full-time to Dallas the following season. In 1973, the franchise relocated to San Antonio and was renamed the San Antonio Spurs. Three years later, the Spurs were one of four ABA franchises that joined the NBA as a result of the ABA\u2013NBA merger.\n In 42 seasons since joining the NBA, the Spurs have achieved a winning record 36 times, have appeared in the NBA playoffs 38 times, and have won five NBA Championships. The team won its most recent NBA championship 2014. The only NBA franchises that have won more championships than the Spurs are the Boston Celtics (17 championships), the Los Angeles Lakers (16), the Golden State Warriors (6), and the Chicago Bulls (6).\n As of the end of the 2018\u201319 season, the Spurs owned the NBA's all-time best win percentage; the team had won 62.2 percent of its games since joining the NBA, placing it ahead of the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers (.593), the Boston Celtics (.590), the Seattle SuperSonics/Oklahoma City Thunder (.541), and the Utah Jazz (.539). The 2017\u201318 season is the first time the Spurs have won less than 50 games in a non-lockout season since the 1996\u201397 season. This was the longest such streak in the NBA.",

The Bulls also achieved a second three peat, a goal unrivaled since the Boston Celtics in 1966. The 1998 playoffs was the last involving the Jordan-led Bulls (Chicago didn't make the playoffs again until 2005). Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP for the sixth and final time.\n The Indiana Pacers took the Bulls to the limit in the Eastern Conference Finals, becoming 1 of only 2 teams to force a Game 7 in the Bulls' title years (the Knicks achieved this in 1992). This team was later named by Pacers.com as the greatest in franchise history, even better than the 2000 team that won the Eastern Conference Title, primarily due to their record.\n The New Jersey Nets made the playoffs for the first time since 1994, but did not appear again until 2002. Their presence was a mere asterisk compared to what they accomplished in 2002, getting swept by the eventual champion Bulls.\n The Cleveland Cavaliers lost to Indiana in the first round 3\u20131 and did not appear again until 2006.\n The Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1991.

The franchise has also been based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Oakland and San Jose, California (during a renovation of its home arena). The team is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946 and won the first BAA championship title in the same year, under coach Edward Gottlieb. The Warriors joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26\u201342 in their first NBA season, and they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962\u201363 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. After playing several home games in Oakland from 1967 onward, the team moved to Oakland full-time for the 1971\u201372 NBA season and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors.\n Led by Rick Barry, the Warriors were a strong franchise during the middle 1970s, achieving winning records every season from 1971\u201372 to 1977\u201378, winning two division titles, and winning the 1975 NBA championship. After Barry departed at the end of the 1977\u201378 season, however, the Warriors were not in the hunt for a title for the next 35 seasons. Between 1978\u201379 and 2011\u201312, the Warriors only achieved winning records in eight seasons. The team also suffered the NBA\u2019s fourth-longest postseason appearance drought in history, with no playoff appearances between 1994\u201395 and 2005\u201306; this mark trails only the Braves/Clippers between 1976\u201377 and 1990\u201391, the Timberwolves between 2004\u201305 and 2016\u201317, and the Kings from 2006\u201307 to 2018\u201319 (still active)\n Led by NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry, the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win the 2015 NBA championship. In the following season, the Warriors--boosted by over half a decade of skillful drafting--finished with the best record in NBA history; the team ended the 2015\u201316 season with a mark of 73\u20139, one win better than Michael Jordan\u2019s 1995\u201396 Bulls. The Warriors reached the 2016 NBA Finals but were defeated by the Cavaliers in seven games. After adding Kevin Durant in the off-season, they won 67 games during the 2016\u201317 campaign. The Warriors set another NBA record by winning 207 games during the three-year period ending in 2017. In the 2017 NBA Finals, the Warriors faced the Cavaliers again and won the NBA title in five games.

The Indiana Pacers won the Central Division for the first time since 2004, while the Los Angeles Clippers made franchise history by winning their first Pacific Division title and having a 56-win season, tied with the Memphis Grizzlies, whose 56 wins were also a franchise record.

After drafting Elvin Hayes first overall in the 1968 NBA Draft, they made their first appearance in the playoffs in 1969. After Hayes was traded, Moses Malone replaced him. Malone won two Most Valuable Player awards during his time in Houston, and led the Rockets to the 1977 Eastern Conference finals in his first year with the Rockets. He also led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, but they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics. Two years after advancing to the finals, the Rockets won a franchise-low 14 games.\n In 1984, the Rockets drafted future Hall-of-Famer Hakeem Olajuwon, who led them to the 1986 Finals in his second year, in which they lost again to Boston. In the next seven seasons, they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times. They did not win their first championship until 1994, when Olajuwon led them to a franchise-best 58 wins, and the championship. The Rockets repeated the feat in 1995, but have not advanced to the finals since. They missed the playoffs from 1999 to 2003, and did not reach the playoffs until after they drafted Yao Ming in 2003. They did not advance past the first round of the playoffs for 13 years, until the 2008\u201309 NBA season. After the arrival of James Harden in 2012 and Dwight Howard the following year, the Rockets had their best seasons since the Olajuwon days, culminating in the Southwest Division title and a return to the Western Conference Finals in 2015. The 2017\u201318 Rockets made franchise history by becoming the first Houston team ever to win 60 or more games in a regular season, finishing at 65\u201317.\n The Rockets have played 52 seasons, and advanced to the playoffs in 33 of those seasons.

Kawhi Leonard was named NBA Finals MVP.\n For the first time since 1984, the NBA Finals were played in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format (the higher seed hosts Games 1, 2, 5, and 7, the lower seed hosts Games 3, 4, and 6). They were also the first playoffs overseen by Commissioner Adam Silver.\n The Spurs continued the longest active playoff streak in the NBA at 17 straight appearances. The Toronto Raptors and Washington Wizards made their first playoff appearances since 2008, while the Charlotte Bobcats, in their final playoff appearance before renaming themselves the Hornets, returned after a four-year absence. All three teams from Texas made the playoffs for the first time since 2009. For the first time since 2005, the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks did not qualify for the playoffs in the same year. For the first time since 1994, the Lakers and Celtics missed the playoffs in the same season. In addition, this was the first time in NBA history that the Knicks, Celtics, and Lakers missed the playoffs in the same year (the Celtics last missed the playoffs in 2007) The Denver Nuggets also missed the playoffs for the first time since 2003.\n The first round of the 2014 Playoffs is generally considered one of the greatest postseason rounds in NBA history. The first 11 days of the playoffs saw at least one road team win on its opponent's home floor. That ended on April 30 with the Raptors, Spurs, and Houston Rockets all winning at home against the Brooklyn Nets, Dallas Mavericks, and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively. The 24 road wins is an NBA playoffs record for the first round. In addition, the 2014 playoffs featured a record eight first-round games that went into overtime, including four straight between the Memphis Grizzlies and Oklahoma City Thunder (Games 2\u20135), another NBA record.\n Five of the eight first-round series were extended to game sevens. Three of the series, Atlanta Hawks at Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies at Oklahoma City Thunder, and Golden State Warriors at Los Angeles Clippers, were played on May 3, which marked the first time in NBA history that three Game 7s were played on the same day. Two other game sevens were played on the following day, featuring Dallas at San Antonio and Brooklyn at Toronto. The five game sevens in the first round already tied the record for the most number of game sevens in any NBA playoffs, set in the 1994 NBA Playoffs. However, the NBA only adopted a best-of-seven format for the first round beginning in 2003. The Hawks\u2013Pacers series was the first series to force a Game 7, making this postseason the 15th consecutive postseason to have at least one Game 7. The 1999 NBA Playoffs were the last time a Game 7 wasn't played.\n This postseason and the previous year's postseason marked the first time since the 2000 and 2001 playoffs that both number 5 seeds knocked out both number 4 seeds in back-to-back years.\n This was the first postseason (and the seventh time since 1972, when the current playoff system was put in place) in which the top two seeds played in the Conference Finals both in the East and the West.\n When they defeated Indiana on the road in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat set an NBA record by recording their 15th straight playoff series in which they earned at least one road win. The Heat then extended the record to 16 straight road wins in playoff series by winning Game 2 of the NBA Finals in San Antonio.",

Following this, the Celtics had two major periods of success separated by quite poor seasons during rebuilding. Between 1971\u201372 and 1975\u201376 the Celtics, led by Dave Cowens and John Havlicek, won 294 of 410 regular season games and reached the conference finals in each of those five seasons, winning two more NBA championships, whilst between 1979\u201380 and 1987\u201388 led by the frontcourt of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish the Celtics won 550 of 742 regular season games and reached every Conference Final except for 1982\u201383 when they were swept in the Conference Semifinals by the Milwaukee Bucks. The Celtics have had 13 separate seasons where they won 60 or more regular season contests, the highest number for any franchise.\n Between 1993\u201394 and 2006\u201307 the Celtics had their single sustained period of failure, with an overall win percent of .423 and only twice getting beyond the first playoff round. With the acquisition of Kevin Garnett for 2007\u201308, the Celtics achieved a record single-season rise in win percentage to claim their first title in twenty-two seasons, in the process achieving the best average point differential between the 1995\u201396 Bulls and the 2015\u201316 Warriors.

The Pacers were led during the ABA days by two-time MVP Mel Daniels and by head coach Bobby Leonard.\n The 1976\u201377 season marked the first season of NBA play for the Pacers and the team struggled early, compared to their ABA success. The Pacers only made it to the NBA playoffs three times in their first 13 seasons. The Pacers would not win their first playoff series until the 1993\u201394 season, which came against the Orlando Magic.

Since 1996, the Sixers have played home games at Wells Fargo Center.\n In 1937, owner Daniel Biasone founded the franchise as the Syracuse Nationals, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs three times then joined the NBA in 1949, one of seven NBL teams to merge with the rival Basketball Association of America (BAA). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs in every season played in Syracuse, advancing to three Finals and Losing. For the 1963\u201364 season, the year following the departure of the Philadelphia Warriors for San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia as the 76ers.\n The franchise has played fifty-three seasons as the Philadelphia 76ers, with thirty-three playoff appearances and zero championships. The Sixers acquired Philadelphia-native Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 from the Warriors and defeated Chamberlain's former team in the 1967 Finals, but suffered a sharp fall from grace due to the loss of Chamberlain to retirement and Billy Cunningham to the ABA: in 1972\u201373 the team won only nine games, the fewest in an 82-game NBA season. Under coaches Gene Shue and Cunningham, and the on-court leadership of forward Julius Erving, the 76ers returned as a power quite rapidly, achieving winning records in all but one season from 1975\u201376 to 1990\u201391.

The 76ers were a middle-of-the-road team on-court during the following dozen seasons, but by the early 2010s financial problems led incoming general manager Sam Hinkie to clean out any expensive players in order to save money and gain draft choices for the future. Lacking on-court talent, the 76ers set many records for ineptitude in the following three seasons, becoming the second NBA team after the 1995\u201396 to 1998\u201399 Grizzlies to suffer three consecutive seasons winning fewer than twenty games.

  "/wiki/List_of_Detroit_Pistons_seasons": "This is a list of seasons completed by the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association. The franchise was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons in the National Basketball League and as the Fort Wayne Pistons joined the Basketball Association of America, which was the precursor to the NBA. However, the games won and lost in the NBL are not included in the franchise total.\n The Pistons have had three main periods of success. In the early years of the NBA the team reached the NBA Finals twice in consecutive years before falling to the Lakers and then to the St. Louis Hawks. Following an extended era of mediocrity the Pistons, led by the Hall of Fame backcourt of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and nicknamed the \"Bad Boys\" for their intimidating defence, posted winning records every seasons from 1983\u201384 to 1991\u201392, and after narrowly losing in 1988, ended the Lakers dynasty of the 1980s the following season and repeated the following year. The Pistons\u2019 third period of success, with former on-court star Dumars serving as general manager and building a top team from other franchises\u2019 discards, occurred between 2001\u201302 and 2007\u201308 when the team won fifty games or more during every season, including a third NBA title in 2003\u201304 and a franchise record total of wins two seasons later.\n The Pistons have experienced two major periods of failure. Between 1956\u201357 and 1982\u201383, the Pistons had just three winning seasons and overall had a winning percentage of .417, culminating in a combined record of 37\u2013127 (win percent .226) in the 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381 seasons, after which the drafting of Isiah Thomas completely revitalized the franchise. Since 2009\u201310, the Pistons have only once finished out of the bottom two in their division or had a winning record. In the six seasons starting in 2009\u201310 the franchise had an overall record of 172 wins from 476 games or a winning percentage of .361.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Los_Angeles_Clippers_seasons": "The Los Angeles Clippers are a professional basketball team based in Los Angeles, California. They play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and are a member of the NBA Western Conference's Pacific Division. The Clippers were founded in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves. They were one of three franchises that joined the NBA as an expansion team in the 1970\u201371 season. The Braves moved to San Diego, California after the 1977\u201378 season, and became known as the San Diego Clippers. For the 1984\u201385 NBA season, the Clippers moved north to Los Angeles and became known as the Los Angeles Clippers.\n On October 14, 1970, the Braves beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 107\u201392 in their first game. In the 1972 NBA Draft, the Braves selected Bob McAdoo, who later won such awards as Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player. During McAdoo's years (1972\u201376) with the franchise, the Braves reached the post-season three times and had a record of nine wins and 13 losses during that time.\n Overall, the Clippers have qualified for the post-season fourteen times; most recently in the 2018-19 season.

In their 45-year history they have never been to a Western Conference Finals, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history. They also have only eleven seasons with a winning percentage of .500 or better, and as a result, in their April 17, 2000 issue, the Sports Illustrated had three Clippers fans on the cover that stated \"The worst franchise in sports history\". However, with the additions of Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, they made steady progress as a title contender in recent years. They won their first division title in the 2012-13 season, their 43rd year in the league, and repeated the following year. Chris Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets for eight players and a 2018 draft pick, after the 2017 season.",
