  "/wiki/Pink_Floyd": "Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a psychedelic rock group, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. They are one of the most commercially successful and influential bands in popular music history.\n Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979), and The Final Cut (1983). The band also composed several film scores.\n Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. The three produced two more albums\u2014A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)\u2014and toured both albums before entering a long period of inactivity. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions.\n Pink Floyd were one of the first British psychedelia groups, and are credited with influencing genres such as progressive rock and ambient music. Four albums topped US or UK record charts; the songs \"See Emily Play\" (1967) and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979) were their only top 10 singles in either territory. The band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall two of the best-selling albums of all time.",
  "/wiki/The_Wall": "The Wall is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released 30 November 1979 on Harvest and Columbia Records. It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rockstar whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society is symbolized by a wall. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks, and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later came to be considered one of the greatest albums of all time.\n Bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In The Flesh tour, modeling the character of Pink after himself and former bandmate Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. Producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. The Wall is the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet; keyboardist Richard Wright was fired by Waters during production, but stayed on as a salaried musician. Three singles were issued from the album: \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (the band's only US number-one single), \"Run Like Hell\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects.\n The Wall was adapted into a 1982 feature film of the same name and remains one of the best-known concept albums.. The album has sold more than 24 million copies, is the second best-selling in the band's catalog, and is one of the best-selling of all time. Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were later used on the group's next album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000 it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, Rolling Stone listed The Wall at number 87 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician.",

  "/wiki/Michael_Jackson": "Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 \u2013 June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the \"King of Pop\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers in the history of music. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres.\n The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall (1979). By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his sixth studio album Thriller (1982), are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity helped propel the television channel MTV into a significant factor of 1980s pop culture. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 26th Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson continued to innovate with videos including \"Leave Me Alone\" and \"Smooth Criminal\" from  Bad (1987), \"Black or White\" and \"Remember the Time\" from Dangerous (1991), \"Scream\" from HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995) and \"Ghosts\" from the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997). Jackson forged a reputation as a global touring artist. With songs such as \"Man in the Mirror\", \"Black or White\", \"Heal the World\", \"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration, environmentalism and fighting against prejudice and injustice. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. \n Starting in the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of sedatives administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's public memorial service was broadcast live. In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide, and Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in February 2010. Nine years later, the documentary Leaving Neverland, which detailed posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse, led to an international backlash against Jackson.\n Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide.[nb 1] His albums Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), rank among the best-selling of all time. Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 66 million copies worldwide. Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997) is the best-selling remix album of all time. Bad was the first album to produce five Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 2] Jackson had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era, and was also the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He won more awards than any other artist in the history of popular music, has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, and is the only recording artist to have been inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame.

  "/wiki/Thriller_(Michael_Jackson_album)": "Thriller is the sixth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released on November 30, 1982 by Epic Records. Reunited with Off the Wall producer Quincy Jones, Jackson was inspired to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". With the ongoing backlash against disco, Jackson moved in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Thriller features a single guest appearance, with Paul McCartney becoming the first artist to be featured on Jackson's albums. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of $750,000. Thriller explores genres including pop, R&B, post-disco, rock and funk. \n Thriller became Jackson's first number one album on the Billboard 200. It produced seven singles: \"The Girl Is Mine\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\u2009\", \"Human Nature\", \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"Thriller\". All the singles reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, setting the record for the most top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one on the chart.

It spent a record 37 weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, from February 26, 1983 to April 14, 1984, and has spent 400 weeks on the chart and counting.\n Thriller's success set the standard for the music industry with its songs, music videos and promotion strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers. In 1984, a pop art of Jackson designed by Andy Warhol was featured on the cover of Time who acclaimed the impact of the album, writing, \"The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'.\" Thriller broke racial barriers in popular music, enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" and the short film Michael Jackson's Thriller all received regular rotation on MTV and are credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, with the latter also popularizing short films in the music industry. \n Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 66 million copies worldwide. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States and was the first to reach 30\u00d7 Platinum or 3\u00d7 Diamond. As of February 2017, it has sold 33 million certified album-equivalent units in the US. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 26th Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year (for \"Beat It\").

In addition to playing various instruments on the album, Michael wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"Look at Your Hands\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. A \"black\" inspired pop-R&B album, Faith's songs include introspective lyrics, which generated controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time.\n By 1986, Michael had spent five years as the lead singer of the popular duo Wham! and had grown tired of accusations that the group, which featured his best friend Andrew Ridgeley, was nothing more than a teenybopper group. After the success of Make It Big, Michael had grown weary of continuing the duo, and expressed to Ridgeley the desire that they should split up which eventually happened. Following the split, Michael began to work on songs that would make his first solo album, which would be titled Faith.\nFaith peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart and US Billboard 200. It stayed for 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the Billboard 200 top 10, including 12 weeks at number one. It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit number one on the Billboard Top Black Albums chart. Faith spawned four number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Faith\", \"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\", and \"Monkey\", making Michael the only British male solo artist to have four number one hits from one album on the Billboard Hot 100. Michael embarked on the The Faith Tour to promote Faith in February 1988, opening at Tokyo's Budokan arena, before going on to dates in Australia, Europe and North America.\nFaith is one of the best-selling albums of all time having sold over 20 million copies worldwide and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1996. The album won several awards, including Album of the Year at the 31st Grammy Awards. Michael won three awards at the 1989 American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Album for Faith. He was also honoured with the MTV Video Vanguard Award. Often ranked as one of the best albums of the 1980s, Faith was ranked number 472 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.",
  "/wiki/Bobby_Brown": "Robert Barisford Brown (born February 5, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, dancer and actor. Brown, alongside frequent collaborator Teddy Riley, is noted as a pioneer of new jack swing; a fusion of hip hop and R&B. Brown started his career in the R&B and pop group New Edition, from its inception in 1981 until his exit from the group in December 1985. \n Starting a solo career, Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album Don't Be Cruel (1988) which spawned five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles including the number one hit \"My Prerogative\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Every Little Step\". In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II. In 1992, Brown married singer Whitney Houston, with whom he had a daughter named Bobbi Kristina Brown. The couple's drug abuse and domestic disputes made them tabloid fodder. \n Brown's next album Bobby (1992) spawned several hit singles including \"Humpin' Around\", \"Get Away,\" and \"Good Enough.\" However, sales of Bobby did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\n Brown also starred in films such as A Thin Line Between Love and Hate and Two Can Play That Game. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005. Brown and Houston starred in the 2005 reality show Being Bobby Brown, and divorced two years later in 2007.",
  "/wiki/Don't_Be_Cruel_(album)": "Don't Be Cruel is the second studio album by American singer Bobby Brown. It was released in the United States on June 20, 1988 by MCA Records.

  "/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums_by_year_in_the_United_States": "This is a list of the best-selling albums by year in the United States. Billboard magazine began publishing year-end lists for album sales in 1956. Until 1991, the Billboard album chart was based on a survey of representative retail outlets that determined a ranking, not a tally of actual sales. Weekly surveys and year-end charts by Billboard and other publications such as now defunct Cash Box magazine sometimes differed. For instance, during the 1960s and 1970s, the number-one album as determined by these two publications differed in 10 out of 20 years. From 1992 onwards, the Billboard year-end and weekly charts were calculated by Nielsen SoundScan. Note that this slightly differs from prior Billboard year-end album charts, which were a measure of chart performances over twelve months from around December to November (cutoff determined by Billboard\u00b4s publication schedule) rather than actual total sales."
