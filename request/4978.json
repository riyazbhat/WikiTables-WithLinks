It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula. The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic, including its standard form, Modern Standard Arabic, also referred to as Literary Arabic, which is modernized Classical Arabic. This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic, but rather refer to both as al-\u02bfarabiyyatu l-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 (\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670, the purest Arabic) or simply al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 (\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670). Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government and the media. Arabic, in its standard form, is the official language of 26 states, as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam, since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic. During the Middle Ages, Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy.",
