  "/wiki/Brera_(district_of_Milan)": "Brera is a district (quartiere) of Milan, Italy. It is located within the Zone 1 (the historical core of the city) and it is centered on Brera street. The name stems from Medieval Italian braida or brera, derived from Old Lombardic brayda (often Latinized as praedium), meaning a land expanse either cleared of trees or naturally lacking them. This is because around the year 900, the Brera district was situated just outside Milan's city walls and was kept clear for military reasons. The root of the word is the same as that of the Dutch city of Breda's name and the English word broad. Brera houses the Brera Academy of Fine Arts and the Brera Art Gallery, which prominently contributed to the development of Brera as an artists' neighborhood and a place of bohemian atmosphere, sometimes referred to as the milanese Montmartre. Both the Academy and the Gallery are located in Palazzo Brera, the main historical building of the area; this same building also houses Milan's botanical garden as well as an astronomical observatory and the Braidense National Library.

  "/wiki/Porta_Genova": "Porta Genova is a neighborhood (quartiere) of Milan, Italy, located within the Zone 6 administrative division. The name Porta Genova means Genoa gate; the district is named after a city gate of the old Spanish Walls of Milan, namely that leading to Genoa, that used to be in what is now Piazza Cantore. The only remnants of the old gate are the small buildings that used to house the customs offices, which replaced the Spanish gate in the 19th Century. As for all Milanese quartieri, the boundaries of Porta Genova are not formally defined; yet, they are usually thought of as comprising Via Solari, Via Bergognone, the Naviglio Grande canal and the Darsena. The district is centered in Piazza Cantore, where the city gate used to be, and the Porta Genova railway station, the oldest Milanese railway station to be still in operation. The station is the terminus of the railway connecting Milan and Mortara. Since the station is in the centre of Porta Genova, the district is divided in two parts by the railway; an old iron bridge connecting the two sides known as la scaletta (the ladder), located next to the station, is one of the traditional landmarks of the district.",
  "/wiki/Porta_Ticinese": "Porta Ticinese (formerly known as Porta Cicca, and during Napoleonic rule as Porta Marengo) is a former city gate of Milan, Italy. The gate, facing south-west, was first created with the Spanish walls of the city, in the 16th century, but the original structure was later demolished and replaced in the early 19th century. The name Porta Ticinese is used both to refer to the gate proper and to the surrounding district, part of the Zone 6 administrative division. In the same district there is also a homonymous medieval gate, although in common speech the name Porta Ticinese is usually assumed to refer to the 19th century gate. The gate of Porta Ticinese is one of the landmark buildings of Milan and a popular tourist attraction. The name Porta Ticinese means Gate to the Ticino, referred to the Ticino river, that traverses the Po Valley south-west of Milan. The name Porta Cicca came about during the Spanish rule of Milan in the 16th century, Cicca being a distortion of the Spanish word chica, i.e., small. The name Porta Marengo, which was used in the 19th century, refers to the village of Marengo located south-west of Milan, now called Spinetta Marengo, scene of the Battle of Marengo between the French army commanded by Napoleon and an Austrian army.",
  "/wiki/Ronchetto_sul_Naviglio": "Ronchetto sul Naviglio is a district (quartiere) of Milan, Italy, part of the Zone 6 administrative division of the city. Before being annexed to Milan (in 1923), it has been an autonomous comune until 1870, and a frazione of Buccinasco between 1870 and 1923. Ronchetto is probably named after an ancient cascina (farmhouse) by that name; in turn, the name of the cascina is derived from the Lombard word ronch, which refers to different types of cultivated areas. The original structure of the once rural settlement of Ronchetto is almost completely unrecognizable in the modern district, which has experienced a massive urbanization process in the 20th century and is now seamlessly connected to the urban agglomeration of Milan. A landmark of Ronchetto is a modern, 700-metre-long (2,300 ft) bridge that crosses both the Naviglio Grande canal and the Milan-Mortara railway, connecting Ronchetto to the Giambellino-Lorenteggio district. The district has been experiencing a long period of decay and is often described as a degraded area. The Duomo Connection trial of the late 1980s revealed the extensive activity of the Mafia in the district. Ronchetto sul Naviglio is also remembered as the scene of a battle between Italian partisans and the German army, occurred on 25 April 1945, i.e., the very day when Italy proclaimed its liberation from the German rule.",

Although administratively part of Milan, Assiano is quite isolated from the urban area and has maintained its rural character. A distinctive feature of Assiano and nearby rural areas is the presence of several ancient fontanili, i.e., artificial water springs. The most important historic building in Assiano is the eponymous cascina (farmhouse), i.e., Cascina Assiano. In the past, the cascina has been the property of several notable Milanese families, including the Agnelli, the Feltrinelli, and the Migliavacca.

Quarto Cagnino is a formerly rural, now urban district, with the last period of quick urban development having occurred in the late 1960s in so called GESCAL projects. The GESCAL acronym stands for Gestione Case per i Lavoratori, i.e., Housing for Workers; these projects were meant to realize vast low-income apartment blocks in rationally organized, satellite city neighbourhoods. Example of GESCAL apartment flats are found along Via Carlo Marx, close to the San Carlo hospital.

In the following decades, as most of the Milanese rural outskirts, Quinto experienced a quick urbanization process as a consequence of the economic boom of northern Italy and immigration from the south, which caused a quick expansion of Milan and other industrial cities. As is the case with other outskirts that have experienced this rapid development in those decades, Quinto gained the reputation of a socially and economically degraded district.
