  "/wiki/Computer_animation": "Computer animation is the process used for digitally generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation only refers to moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well. Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to stop motion techniques, but using 3D models, and traditional animation techniques using frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer-generated animations are more controllable than other, more physically based processes, like constructing miniatures for effects shots, or hiring extras for crowd scenes, because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces, or props. To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer monitor and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it but advanced slightly in time (usually at a rate of 24, 25, or 30 frames/second).",

  "/wiki/Infomercials_(TV_specials)": "Infomercials is an umbrella title for a project of quarter-hour American television comedy specials airing on Adult Swim. Unlike actual paid programming, all of the programs are fictitious, and for the most part maintain no continuity with each other. Most of them lampoon the format of actual infomercials, while others parody tropes and cliches in niche media such as closed-circuit hotel information channels, industrial films, sitcoms, older reality television formats of the past, and public-access television. A number of the titles may be purposefully filmed to have a standard definition look and framing to go with the aesthetics of those works. The specials typically air at 4 a.m. ET/PT. There is no title card or common identifier to any of the specials, and on some electronic program guide listings, it can be confused as an actual segment of paid programming; if there is a description, it is generic or blank, with no season or episode numbers. Every title has a different look and feel as outside the common Williams Street/Adult Swim production logos (and most of the time, state tax credit-funded productions with the Georgia Department of Economic Development's card because they were filmed in the network's home state), there are no common directors, production companies or crew between all of them, although some have returned to make additional (and unrelated) programs. One in particular, \"Too Many Cooks\", is notable for gathering media interest in November 2014.",
  "/wiki/Infomercial": "An infomercial is a form of television commercial, which generally includes a toll-free telephone number or website. Most often used as a form of direct response television (DRTV), long-form infomercials are typically 28:30 or 58:30 minutes in length. Infomercials are also known as paid programming (or teleshopping in Europe). This phenomenon started in the United States, where infomercials were typically shown overnight (usually 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), outside peak prime time hours for commercial broadcasters. Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off. Some channels air infomercials 24 hours. Some stations also choose to air infomercials during the daytime hours mostly on weekends to fill in for unscheduled network or syndicated programming. By 2009, most infomercial spending in the U.S. occurred during the early morning, daytime and evening hours, or in the afternoon.",
  "/wiki/Graveyard_slot": "A graveyard slot (or death slot) is a time period in which a television audience is very small compared to other times of the day, and therefore broadcast programming is considered far less important. Graveyard slots are usually in the early morning hours of each day, when most people are asleep.\n With little likelihood of a substantial viewing audience during this daypart, providing useful television programming during this time is usually considered unimportant; some broadcast stations go off the air during these hours, and some audience measurement systems do not collect measurements for these periods. Some broadcasters may do engineering work at this time. Others use broadcast automation to pass-through network feeds unattended, with only broadcasting authority-mandated personnel and emergency anchors/reporters present at the local station overnight.  A few stations use \"we're always on\" or a variant to promote their 24-hour operation as a selling point, though as this is now the rule rather than the exception it was in the past, it has now mainly become a selling point for a station's website instead.",
