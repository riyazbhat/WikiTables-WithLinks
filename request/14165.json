  "/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis": "Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax\u2014a common disease of livestock and, occasionally, of humans\u2014and the only obligate pathogen within the genus Bacillus. This disease can be classified as a zoonosis, causing infected animals to transmit the disease to humans.  B. anthracis is a Gram-positive, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, with a width of 1.0\u20131.2 \u00b5m and a length of 3\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m. It can be grown in an ordinary nutrient medium under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.",
  "/wiki/Bacilli": "Bacilli is a taxonomic class of bacteria that includes two orders, Bacillales and Lactobacillales, which contain several well-known pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis (the cause of anthrax). Bacilli are almost exclusively gram-positive bacteria.",
  "/wiki/Bacillus_cereus": "Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic, motile, beta-hemolytic, spore forming bacterium commonly found in soil and food. The specific name, cereus, meaning \"waxy\" in Latin, refers to the appearance of colonies grown on blood agar. Some strains are harmful to humans and cause foodborne illness, while other strains can be beneficial as probiotics for animals. The bacteria is classically contracted from fried rice dishes that have been sitting at room temperature for hours. B. cereus bacteria are facultative anaerobes, and like other members of the genus Bacillus, can produce protective endospores. Its virulence factors include cereolysin and phospholipase C.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/Bacillus_clausii": "Bacillus clausii is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, motile and spore-forming bacterium that lives in the soil. It is classified as probiotic microorganism that maintains a symbiotic relationship with the host organism. It is currently being studied in respiratory infections and some gastrointestinal disorders. Bacillus clausii, has been found to produce antimicrobial substances that are active against gram positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Clostridium difficile. It is sold by Sanofi as Enterogermina.",
  "/wiki/Bacillus_halodurans": "Bacillus halodurans is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, motile and spore-forming bacterium found in soil.  In a genomic comparison with Bacillus subtilis, B. halodurans strain C-125 - originally an unclassified Bacillus strain - was found to contain unique genes and sigma factors that may have aided its adaptation to more alkaline environments.",
  "/wiki/Bacillus_licheniformis": "Bacillus licheniformis is a bacterium commonly found in the soil. It is found on bird feathers, especially chest and back plumage, and most often in ground-dwelling birds (like sparrows) and aquatic species (like ducks).",
  "/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis": "Bacillus subtilis, known also as the hay bacillus or grass bacillus, is a Gram-positive, catalase-positive bacterium, found in soil and the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants and humans. A member of the genus Bacillus, B. subtilis is rod-shaped, and can form a tough, protective endospore, allowing it to tolerate extreme environmental conditions. B. subtilis has historically been classified as an obligate aerobe, though evidence exists that it is a facultative anaerobe. B. subtilis is considered the best studied Gram-positive bacterium and a model organism to study bacterial chromosome replication and cell differentiation. It is one of the bacterial champions in secreted enzyme production and used on an industrial scale by biotechnology companies.",
  "/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis": "Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, commonly used as a biological pesticide. B. thuringiensis also occurs naturally in the gut of caterpillars of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities. It has also been observed to parasitize other moths such as Cadra calidella\u2014in laboratory experiments working with C. calidella, many of the moths were diseased due to this parasite.",
  "/wiki/Carboxydothermus_hydrogenoformans": "Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is an extremely thermophilic anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that has the interesting property of producing hydrogen as a waste product while feeding on carbon monoxide and water.  It also forms endospores.",
  "/wiki/Clostridia": "The Clostridia are a highly polyphyletic class of Firmicutes, including Clostridium and other similar genera.  They are distinguished from the Bacilli by lacking aerobic respiration. They are obligate anaerobes and oxygen is toxic to them. Species of the class Clostridia are often but not always Gram-positive (see Halanaerobium hydrogenoformans) and have the ability to form spores. Studies show they are not a monophyletic group, and their relationships are not entirely certain.  Currently, most are placed in a single order called Clostridiales, but this is not a natural group and is likely to be redefined in the future.",
  "/wiki/Clostridium_acetobutylicum": "Clostridium acetobutylicum, ATCC 824, is a commercially valuable bacterium sometimes called the \"Weizmann Organism\", after Jewish-Russian-born Chaim Weizmann. A senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, England, he used them in 1916 as a bio-chemical tool to produce  at the same time,  jointly, acetone, ethanol, and butanol from starch. The method has been described since as the ABE process,  (Acetone Butanol Ethanol fermentation process), yielding 3 parts of acetone, 6 of butanol, and 1 of ethanol. Acetone was used in the important wartime task of casting cordite. The alcohols were used to produce vehicle fuels and synthetic rubber.",
  "/wiki/Clostridium_difficile_(bacteria)": "Clostridioides difficile (syn. Clostridium difficile), also known as Peptoclostridium difficile, C. difficile, or C. diff (/si\u02d0 d\u026af/),  is  Gram-positive species of spore-forming bacteria.",
  "/wiki/Clostridium_perfringens": "Clostridium perfringens (formerly known as C. welchii, or Bacillus welchii) is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming pathogenic bacterium of the genus Clostridium. C. perfringens is ever-present in nature and can be found as a normal component of decaying vegetation, marine sediment, the intestinal tract of humans and other vertebrates, insects, and soil.  It has the shortest reported generation time of any organism at 6.3 minutes in thioglycolate medium.",
  "/wiki/Clostridium_tetani": "Clostridium tetani is a common soil bacterium and the causative agent of tetanus. When growing in soil, C. tetani is rod-shaped and up to 2.5 \u03bcm long. However, when forming spores, C. tetani becomes substantially enlarged at one end, resembling a tennis racket or drumstick. C. tetani spores are extremely hardy and can be found globally in soil or in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. If inoculated into a wound, C. tetani can grow and produce a potent toxin, tetanospasmin, which interferes with motor neurons, causing tetanus. The toxin's action can be prevented with tetanus toxoid vaccines, which are often administered to children worldwide.",

  "/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis": "Enterococcus faecalis \u2013 formerly classified as part of the group D Streptococcus system \u2013 is a Gram-positive, commensal bacterium inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other mammals. Like other species in the genus Enterococcus, E. faecalis is found in healthy humans, but can cause life-threatening infections, especially in the nosocomial (hospital) environment, where the naturally high levels of antibiotic resistance found in E. faecalis contribute to its pathogenicity.\nE. faecalis has been frequently found in reinfected, root canal-treated teeth in prevalence values ranging from 30% to 90% of the cases. Re-infected root canal-treated teeth are about nine times more likely to harbor E. faecalis than cases of primary infections.",
