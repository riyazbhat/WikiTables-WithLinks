It was strongly influenced by Taoist philosophy, especially Neo-Daoist thought, and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Ch\u00e1n spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n, northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism, and east to Japan, becoming Japanese Zen. The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa (Ch\u00e1n), which traces its roots to the Indian practice of dhy\u0101na (meditation). [note 1] Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation-practice, insight into the nature of mind (Ch. jianxing, Jp. kensho, perceiving the true nature) and nature of things, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others.
