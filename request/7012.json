  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_mottos": "All of the United States' 50 states have a state motto, as do the District of Columbia, and 3 U.S. territories. A motto is a phrase intended to formally describe the general motivation or intention of an organization. State mottos can sometimes be found on state seals or state flags. Some states have officially designated a state motto by an act of the state legislature, whereas other states have the motto only as an element of their seals. The motto of the United States itself is In God We Trust, proclaimed by Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 30, 1956. The motto E Pluribus Unum (Latin for One from many) was approved for use on the Great Seal of the United States in 1782, but was never adopted as the national motto through legislative action. South Carolina has two official mottos, both of which are in Latin. Kentucky, North Dakota, and Vermont also have two mottos, one in Latin and the other in English.",
  "/wiki/Friendship": "Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association, and has been studied in academic fields such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.\n Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include affection; kindness, love, virtue, sympathy, empathy, honesty, altruism, loyalty, generosity, forgiveness, mutual understanding and compassion, enjoyment of each other's company, trust, and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend. Friendship is an essential aspect of relationship building skills.",

Growth continues over the mild winter, and then in the spring takes off, rapidly grow larger, before sending up a 20\u2013 to 50-cm-tall plume of blue flowers (with bits of white and occasionally a tinge of pinkish-red).

Other official state dogs also are indigenous to their state, including the Boston Terrier (Massachusetts) and the Alaskan Malamute (Alaska). Pennsylvania selected the Great Dane not because of its origin, but because it was introduced by early settlers in the state to be used as a hunting and working dog; it was chosen over the Beagle, which was also proposed around the same time.
