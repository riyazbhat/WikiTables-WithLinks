Like previous seasons, this season showcases a lineup of 8 couples. Ron MacLean returns as the show's host. Former co-host Kurt Browning assumes judging duties on a new judging panel, along with Olympic figure skating gold medalist and season one champion Jamie Sal\u00e9, and former NHL player and season two competitor P.J. Stock. This season does not feature rotating guest judges every week. The show venue for this season continues to be at the MasterCard Centre in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario. There are no Monday night results show this season; therefore, elimination takes place at the end of each Sunday night performance show from Week 2 onwards."
