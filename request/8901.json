He later coached  Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, OGC Nice and FC Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n During his playing career with FC Barcelona he scored 184 official goals and currently is the club's all time fifth top goalscorer behind Luis Su\u00e1rez, who scored 187 goals; Ladislao Kubala, who scored 194 goals; C\u00e9sar, who scored 232 goals and Lionel Messi, who scored 613 goals. As a player, he pioneered the midfield general role and was nicknamed Surrealista (The Surrealist) and Home Magosta (The Grasshopper Man) due to his style. As a manager, he led Barcelona to a La Liga title in 1945 and as a scout he recruited another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala. However, he was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano  and in the 1960s he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di St\u00e9fano affair, twice defecting to Real Madrid and his friendship with Francisco Franco, he remained a legendary figure at FC Barcelona.[citation needed] When he died in 1972 he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.",
