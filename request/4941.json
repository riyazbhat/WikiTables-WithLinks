  "/wiki/Nondestructive_testing": "Nondestructive testing (NDT) is a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.\nThe terms nondestructive examination (NDE), nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.\nBecause NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing. NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art. Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound impact on medical imaging, including on echocardiography, medical ultrasonography, and digital radiography.",
  "/wiki/Acoustics": "Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound.

  "/wiki/MOCVD": "Metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE), also known as organometallic vapour-phase epitaxy (OMVPE) or metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), is a chemical vapour deposition method used to produce single- or polycrystalline thin films. It is a process for growing crystalline layers to create complex semiconductor multilayer structures.  In contrast to molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), the growth of crystals is by chemical reaction and not physical deposition.  This takes place not in vacuum, but from the gas phase at moderate pressures (10 to 760\u00a0Torr). As such, this technique is preferred for the formation of devices incorporating thermodynamically metastable alloys,[citation needed] and it has become a major process in the manufacture of optoelectronics. It was invented in 1968 at North American Aviation (later Rockwell International) Science Center by Harold M. Manasevit.",
