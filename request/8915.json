  "/wiki/Rodney_Alcala": "Rodney James Alcala (born Rodrigo Jacques Alcala Buquor; August 23, 1943) is an American convicted rapist and serial killer who was sentenced to death in California for five murders committed in that state between 1977 and 1979, and received an additional sentence of 25 years to life after pleading guilty to two homicides committed in New York in 1971 and 1977. Alcala's true victim count remains unknown, and could be much higher.\n Alcala compiled a collection of more than 1,000 photographs of women and teenage boys, many in sexually explicit poses. In 2016, he was charged with the 1977 murder of a woman identified in one of his photos. Alcala is known to have assaulted one other photographic subject, and police have speculated that others could be rape or murder victims as well.\n Prosecutors have said that Alcala \"toyed\" with his victims, strangling them until they lost consciousness, then waiting until they revived, sometimes repeating this process several times before finally killing them. One police detective described Alcala as \"a killing machine\", and others have compared him to Ted Bundy.\n Alcala is sometimes called the \"Dating Game Killer\" because of his 1978 appearance on the television show The Dating Game in the midst of his murder spree.",

Davis abducted Klaas on October 1, 1993, from her Petaluma, California, home. A San Jose, California, Superior Court jury returned a verdict of death on August 5, 1996. After the verdict was read, Davis stood and made an obscene finger gesture at the courtroom camera with both hands. Later, at his formal sentencing, Davis read a statement claiming that Klaas had said to Davis, \"Just don't do me like my dad,\" just before Davis killed her, implying that Klaas's father was a child molester.

  "/wiki/Albert_Greenwood_Brown": "Albert Greenwood Brown, Jr. (born August 18, 1954) is an American who has been convicted of sexual molestation with force of a minor, two counts of first-degree rape with force, and the first-degree murder of a teen girl in Riverside, California. He was scheduled to die by lethal injection at 9 p.m. on September 30, 2010, in California's first use of capital punishment since the lifting of a court-ordered moratorium. The use of lethal injection had been suspended in the state since February 2006 because of objections of cruel and unusual punishment for shortcomings of the facilities and procedures previously in use at San Quentin State Prison. Brown's lawyers appealed to block their client's execution, with the execution initially planned to be carried out in a new facility at the prison that is certified to use either a single or three-drug protocol. The US Ninth Court of Appeals ordered US District Judge Jeremy D. Fogel to review the case and noted that the execution date may have been influenced by the fact that the prison's inventory of sodium thiopental, one of the drugs required for lethal injection, would expire on October 1, 2010. Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections. On September 29, 2010, the Supreme Court of California unanimously denied an appeal by the state to proceed by the end of the month. Brown's execution was then delayed because the prison's supply of the lethal injection drug had expired.",

The evidence in the case has been reviewed during the original trial, by the California Supreme Court, by the United States District Court, and by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2007, two judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that \"As the district court, and all state courts, have repeatedly found, evidence of Cooper's guilt was overwhelming. The tests that he asked for to show his innocence 'once and for all' show nothing of the sort.\" In a concurring opinion, however, Judge Margaret McKeown said she was troubled that the court could not resolve the question of Cooper's guilt \"once and for all\" and noted that significant evidence bearing on Cooper's culpability has been lost, destroyed or left unpursued.",
