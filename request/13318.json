  "/wiki/Miss_Venezuela_2008": "Miss Venezuela 2008 was the 55th Miss Venezuela pageant, was held in Caracas, Venezuela, on September 10, 2008, after weeks of events.  The winner of the pageant was Stefan\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez, Miss Trujillo.\n The pageant was broadcast live on Venevisi\u00f3n from the Poliedro de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. At the conclusion of the final night of competition, outgoing titleholder Dayana Mendoza (Miss Venezuela 2007 and Miss Universe 2008) crowned Stefania Fern\u00e1ndez of Trujillo as the new Miss Venezuela.\n The contest, whose winner will attempt to become the first woman to win a Miss Universe title for her country in consecutive years, was marked by the elimination of the titles of Costa Oriental and Peninsula Goajira (now represented solely by Zulia state) and the consequent reduction to 28 delegates.  On July 29, Osmel Sousa assumed further control of the selection process by directly appointing the 28 final contestants from a pool of 73 candidates.  Although winners of regional and state contests have never been guaranteed participation in the final Miss Venezuela pageant, this direct selection resulted in the unprecedented elimination of the representatives of Falc\u00f3n, Lara, Sucre, Vargas and Nueva Esparta.  In addition to the two aforementioned titleholders from Zulia, a total of seven state winners were consequently stripped of their titles, which will be carried in the final pageant by other candidates."
