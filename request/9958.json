  "/wiki/Roy_Orbison": "Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 \u2013 December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician known for his impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads.

He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses. Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band in high school. He was signed by Sam Phillips, of Sun Records, in 1956, but his greatest success came with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the Billboard Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"Only the Lonely\" (1960), \"Running Scared\" (1961), \"Crying\" (1961), \"In Dreams\" (1963), and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964).
