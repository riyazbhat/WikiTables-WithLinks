Since statehood, there have been 36 governors, serving 41 distinct terms. The longest-serving governors were Richard Dick Lamm (1975-1987) and Roy Romer (1987-1999), who each served 12 years over three terms. The shortest term occurred in March 16 and 17, 1905, when the state had three governors in the span of 24 hours: Alva Adams won the election, but soon after he took office, the legislature declared his opponent, James Hamilton Peabody, governor, but on the condition that he immediately resign, so that his lieutenant governor, Jesse McDonald, could be governor. Thus, Peabody served less than a day as governor. The current governor is Democrat Jared Polis, who took office on January 8, 2019."
