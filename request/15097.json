As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels.\n In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels (abbreviated NVL, derived from novel), which consist predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG, or ADV derived from adventure), a form of adventure game which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as visual novels by international fans. Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.\n Visual novels are often produced for video game consoles, and the more popular games have occasionally been ported to such systems.
