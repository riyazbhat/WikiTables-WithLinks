Almost all Wild Mice feature \"switchback\" sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections. Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0, but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating).
