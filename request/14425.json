In 2014 it was voted as the best theme park in the United Kingdom and the ninth-best park in Europe by the Travelers' Choice Awards.\n The park is host to many records, including the largest number of roller coasters of any park in the United Kingdom with ten, of which four are wooden: the Big Dipper, Blue Flyer, Grand National and Nickelodeon Streak. Many of the roller coasters in the park are record-breaking attractions. When it opened in 1994, the Big One was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world. It was also the steepest, with an incline angle of 65\u00b0 and one of the longest, measuring 5,497 feet (1,675 m). Currently, the ride holds the record as the tallest roller coaster in the United Kingdom, standing at 213 ft (65 m), with a first drop of 205 ft (62 m).\n The park was the first in Europe to introduce a fully inverting steel coaster, Revolution and is the last remaining park in the world to still operate a Steeplechase roller coaster. The Grand National is one of only three M\u00f6bius loop coasters in existence, where a singular track \"loops\" around itself, offering a facsimile out-and-back layout and creating a \"racing\" effect on two parallel tracks.

Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0, but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating). Some riders, usually among taller people, report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns.[citation needed]\n The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself, giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out, thus giving it the name \"wild\".\n Some may include trick-track \u2014 a \"straight\" piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right.

The Gravity Group designed the Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer in Erie, Pennsylvania, which was opened at the start of the 2008 season. In 2009 the Fireball was opened at Happy Valley in China, becoming China's first wooden roller coaster. In 2011 Quassy Amusement Park opened Wooden Warrior, the company's sixth wooden roller coaster. The Gravity Group was also involved in the rebuilding of Libertyland's Zippin Pippin at Bay Beach Amusement Park in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n In 2008, members of The Gravity Group announced the development of their own wooden coaster trains called Timberliners.  They are being produced by Gravitykraft Corporation, a sister company to The Gravity Group.  The Gravity Group promotes their trains as the only wooden coaster trains capable of steering through curves, resulting in a more comfortable and maintenance friendly ride.  Timberliners were planned to debut on The Voyage at Holiday World for the 2010 season, but after four years of delays, Holiday World officially cancelled the project on August 16, 2013.  However, in 2011, the Timberliners appeared on Wooden Warrior at Quassy Amusement Park in Connecticut and on Twister at Gr\u00f6na Lund in Sweden, and in 2013 were added to Hades as part of its transformation to Hades 360.",
