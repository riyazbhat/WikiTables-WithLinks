  "/wiki/List_of_print_media_in_New_Zealand": "This is a list of print media in New Zealand. New Zealand once had several daily newspapers in each major city, usually a morning paper (which had a wider circulation into rural areas) and an evening paper)  As in other countries, the print medium has been damaged by radio, then television and then the internet. The major cites now have only one daily newspaper.\n There are no truly national newspapers, although The New Zealand Herald and to a lesser extent The Dominion Post are both available outside their core areas. The four main centres of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin are served by The New Zealand Herald, The Dominion, The Press, and the Otago Daily Times, respectively. There are also several weekly newspapers with a national scope, including two tabloids, the Sunday News and the Herald on Sunday. There are also numerous low-budget and free weekly newspapers catering for particular suburbs or for subcultures including the gay and farming communities and various ethnic groups.\n The ownership of New Zealand newspapers is dominated by Fairfax New Zealand and NZME, with Fairfax having 48.6 per cent of the daily newspaper circulation."
