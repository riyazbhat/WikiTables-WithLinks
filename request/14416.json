There was an accompanying book of the same title. The documentary was also published by BBC in 2004 as a two part documentary of 50 minutes each and was narrated by Andrew Sachs.\n Like previous Walking with... documentaries, Walking with Cavemen is produced in the style of a nature documentary, featuring a voice-over narrator (Robert Winston in the British release, Alec Baldwin in the North American release) who describes the recreations of the prehistoric past as if they were real. As with the predecessors, this approach necessitated the presentation of speculation as if it were fact, and some of the statements made about the behaviour of the creatures are more open to question than the documentary may indicate. The style is different in UK and US versions, as Robert Winston travels through time to the location of drama taking place, while Alec Baldwin remains ever in the present day in a lit room with skulls representative of ancestral hominid species highlighted in each drama.\n Each segment takes the form of a short drama featuring a group of the particular hominid in question going about their daily lives (the search for food, protecting territory, and caring for the sick and injured). The intent is to get the human viewer to feel for the creatures being examined, almost to imagine being one of them (a trait that the documentary links to the modern human brain).",

  "/wiki/Wheel_of_Time_(film)": "Wheel of Time is a 2003 documentary film about Tibetan Buddhism by German director Werner Herzog. The title refers to the Kalachakra sand mandala that provides a recurring image for the film.\n The film documents the two Kalachakra initiations of 2002, presided over by the fourteenth Dalai Lama. The first, in Bodhgaya India, was disrupted by the Dalai Lama's illness. Later that same year, the event was held again, this time without disruption, in Graz, Austria. The film's first location is the Bodhgaya, the site of the Mahabodhi Temple and the Bodhi tree. Herzog then turns to the pilgrimage at Mount Kailash, after which the film then focuses on the second gathering in Graz.\n Herzog includes a personal interview with the Dalai Lama, as well as Tibetan former political prisoner Takna Jigme Zangpo, who served 37 years in a Chinese prison for his support of the International Tibet Independence Movement.",

He has published more than a dozen books of prose, and directed as many operas.\n French filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once called Herzog \"the most important film director alive.\" American film critic Roger Ebert said that Herzog \"has never created a single film that is compromised, shameful, made for pragmatic reasons, or uninteresting. Even his failures are spectacular.\"\n He was named one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2009.",
