He won the FA Cup with Barnsley and the Football League Second Division with Leeds United. He started his managerial career with Barnsley, being there between 1898 until 1901. He was replaced by John McCartney until 1904, when he came back as manager until 1912, and won the FA Cup with them in his last season in charge(of his 2nd spell). After his success at Barnsley, he was persuaded to join Huddersfield where he laid the groundwork for the success to be achieved by Herbert Chapman. When Huddersfield chairman Hilton Crowther decided that a Leeds-based team would be a better vehicle for his attentions, he persuaded his manager to move with him, and so Fairclough took over from Dick Ray as Leeds United manager for the club's first full season in the Football League. Fairclough put together a useful team, and in 1923-24 he saw his side win promotion to the First Division. The following year saw the signing of the goal-scoring talents of Tom Jennings and Russell Wainscoat, to stand alongside the defensive abilities of Ernest Hart and Tom Townsley.",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north. The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain, which lies in the North Atlantic, and includes over 100 smaller islands, such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight. It is the largest country of British Isles. The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period, but takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century, and since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world.",
