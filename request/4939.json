  "/wiki/George_P._\"Bud\"_Peterson": "George P. \"Bud\" Peterson (born Sept. 1, 1952) is the former president of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Peterson is a graduate of Kansas State University, where he earned B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics and an M.S. in Engineering, and Texas A&M University, where he earned a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering. On Jan. 7, 2019, Dr. Peterson announced his upcoming retirement from Georgia Tech, effective summer of 2019. His successor, \u00c1ngel Cabrera, assumed the office Sept. 1, 2019, after serving for seven years as president of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. In September 2019, the University System of Georgia Board of Regents voted to name Peterson President Emeritus and Regents Professor of Mechanical Engineering for the standard three-year term. The Board of Regents also awarded him tenure.\n Prior to his position as Georgia Tech's 11th president, Peterson served as the chancellor of the University of Colorado at Boulder, the provost of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and associate vice-chancellor and executive associate dean of Engineering of Texas A&M University.\n Peterson was named as the sole finalist for the position of president of Georgia Tech on Feb. 2, 2009, and was accepted Feb. 25, 2009. He succeeded G. Wayne Clough and Gary Schuster (interim) when he took the position April 1, 2009. He was officially installed as president at a Sept. 3, 2009, investiture ceremony. Peterson shares his first name and middle initial with Georgia Tech's famous fictional student, George P. Burdell.\n On Oct. 17, 2009, Dr. Peterson accepted the north end-zone goalposts from students and fans on his lawn after the No. 19 Yellow Jackets upset the fourth-ranked Hokies in Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field. This was the first time Georgia Tech beat a top 5 team at Grant Field (The Jackets beat No. 3 Miami on the road in 2005) since the 1962 Alabama game.\n Peterson presided during a time of great momentum at Georgia Tech. By 2016, freshman applications had tripled since his arrival, resulting in the best-qualified and one of the most diverse freshman classes in Georgia Tech history for eight consecutive fall semesters. During his 10 years, enrollment increased by 69 percent (24 percent, undergraduates; 159 percent, graduate students). Under Peterson\u2019s leadership, the Institute expanded collaborations and strategic partnerships with organizations such as Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, and the CDC, as well as with business, industry, and government. Georgia Tech and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta have established a Pediatric Technology Center, located in the Roger A. and Helen B. Krone Engineered Biosystems Building, which opened in 2015. The building has more than 200,000 square feet of multidisciplinary research space and is expected to drive innovation in the areas of biomedical science and human health.\n Under Peterson, Georgia Tech created innovation neighborhoods around the campus. The most notable is Tech Square, which has become home to innovation centers for numerous Fortune 500 companies. In 2015-16, companies including Anthem, The Home Depot, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Delta Air Lines, Emerson, Southern Company, NCR, and Worldpay opened innovation centers in or near Tech Square, joining AT&T Mobility and Panasonic, among others. These innovation centers provide an opportunity for large companies to interact with the talent, expertise, and technologies at Georgia Tech, including students, faculty, and staff researchers, as well as startups.\n Another project completed during Peterson's tenure is Coda, a collaborative building with John Portman & Associates in which Georgia Tech is the anchor tenant. The 750,000-square-foot facility houses Tech\u2019s high-performance computing center, which is expected to draw even more expertise and enterprise to Tech\u2019s mixed-use community of innovation and education. Excavation was completed in August 2017, and Coda officially opened May 23, 2019, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n The largest single scholarship endowment fund in Georgia Tech\u2019s history has been established to honor Peterson and first lady Valerie H. Peterson. Totaling $17 million, the G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson and Valerie H. Peterson Scholarship Endowment Fund was announced at the June 2019 meeting of the Georgia Tech Foundation. The Fund was established to help students with demonstrated financial need from across the nation.",

  "/wiki/Southern_United_States": "The Southern United States, also known as the American South or simply the South, is a geographic and cultural region of the United States. It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States, with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south.\n The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner. California, Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia, permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations; however, the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions.\n Usually, the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States. The region is known for its culture and history, having developed its own customs, musical styles, and cuisines, which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States. The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European (mostly English, Italian, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, Irish, German, French, Portuguese and Spanish American), African and some Native American components.\n Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population; support for the doctrine of states' rights, and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era, as seen in thousands of lynchings (mostly from 1880 to 1930), the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as \"Jim Crow laws\", that lasted until the 1960s, and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s. Since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, black people have held many offices in Southern states, especially in the coastal states of Virginia and South Carolina. Black people have also been elected or appointed as mayors and police chiefs in the metropolises of Baltimore, Charlotte, Raleigh, Birmingham, Richmond, Columbia, Memphis, Houston, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Jackson, and New Orleans, and serve in both the U.S. Congress and state legislatures. Scholars have characterized pockets of the Southern United States as being \"authoritarian enclaves\" from Reconstruction until the Civil Rights Act.\n Historically, the South relied heavily on agriculture, and was highly rural until after 1945. It has since become more industrialized and urban and has attracted national and international migrants. The American South is now among the fastest-growing areas in the United States. Houston is the largest city in the Southern United States. Sociological research indicates that Southern collective identity stems from political, demographic, and cultural distinctiveness from the rest of the United States. The region contains almost all of the Bible Belt, an area of high Protestant church attendance (especially evangelical churches such as the Southern Baptist Convention) and predominantly conservative, religion-influenced politics.  Indeed, studies have shown that Southerners are more conservative than non-Southerners in several areas, including religion, morality, international relations, and race relations. This is evident in both the region's religious attendance figures and in the region's usually strong support for the Republican Party in political elections since the 1960s, and especially since the 1990s. Apart from its climate, the living experience in the South increasingly resembles the rest of the nation.",

  "/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Research_Institute": "The Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is the nonprofit applied research arm of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. GTRI employs around 2,400 people, and is involved in approximately $600 million in research annually for more than 200 clients in industry and government.\n Initially known as the Engineering Experiment Station, (EES) the organization was proposed in 1929 by W. Harry Vaughan as an analogue to the agricultural experiment stations; the Georgia General Assembly passed a law that year creating the organization on paper, but did not allocate funds to start it. To boost the state's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression, funds were found, and the station was finally established with US$5,000 (equivalent to $80,000 in 2018) in April 1934.\n GTRI's research spans a variety of disciplines, including national defense, homeland security, public health, education, mobile and wireless technologies, and economic development. Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies, the state of Georgia, non-defense federal agencies, and private industry. Overall, contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI's total research funding. Since it was established, GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science, economics, policy, and other areas that leverage GTRI's partnership with Georgia Tech. GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents.",
