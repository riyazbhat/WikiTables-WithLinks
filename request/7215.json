  "/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team": "The New Zealand national rugby union team, commonly known as the All Blacks, represents New Zealand in men's international rugby union, which is considered to be the country's national sport. The team won the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and 2015, as well as the inaugural tournament in 1987.\n New Zealand has a 77 per cent winning record in test match rugby, and is the only international men's side to have secured more wins than losses against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have played test matches against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the All Blacks. The team has also played against three multinational all-star teams, losing only eight of 45 matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. They jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation, along with England.\n The All Blacks compete with Argentina, Australia and South Africa in The Rugby Championship, and have won the trophy sixteen times in the competition's 23-year history. The team has completed a Grand Slam tour, against the four nations of the United Kingdom, four times (1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010). New Zealand has been named the World Rugby Team of the Year ten times since the award was created in 2001, and an All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award ten times over the same period. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame.\n The team's first match was in 1884 in New South Wales, and their first international test match was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year, they hosted their first-ever home test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington.[a] This was followed by a 34-game tour of Europe and North America in 1905 (which included five test matches), where New Zealand suffered only one defeat: their first ever test loss, against Wales.\n New Zealand's early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. By the 1905 tour, they were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and the name \"All Blacks\" dates from this time. The team performs a haka before every match; this is a M\u0101ori challenge or posture dance, which has traditionally been Te Rauparaha's Ka Mate, although Kapa o Pango has also been performed since 2005.",

Like their Polynesian neighbours, the Tongans start their matches with a war dance \u2013 the Sipi Tau. They are members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) along with Fiji and Samoa. The Ikale Tahi achieved a historic 19\u201314 victory over France in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, but having lost to New Zealand and Canada, were unable to achieve what would have been their first ever presence at the quarter-finals.",

On 3 October, it was announced that New Zealand winger Richard Kahui had been voted official Player of Pool A.",
  "/wiki/Japan_national_rugby_union_team": "The Japan national rugby union team (often known as the Cherry Blossoms, Sakura, and, more recently, The Brave Blossoms), is traditionally the strongest rugby union power in Asia and has enjoyed and endured mixed results against non-Asian teams over the years. Rugby union in Japan is administered by the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU), which was founded in 1926. They compete annually in the Pacific Nations Cup and previously in the Asia Rugby Championship. They have also participated in every Rugby World Cup since the tournament began in 1987.\n Rugby was first played in Japan's treaty ports as early as 1866. Popular participation by local university teams was established in 1899 and Japan's first recorded international match was a match against a Canadian team in 1932. Notable games for Japan include a victory over the Junior All Blacks in 1968, and a narrow 6\u20133 loss to England in 1971. Famous wins by Japan include a 28\u201324 victory over a Scotland XV in 1989 and a 23\u20138 victory over Wales in 2013. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Japan drew 12\u201312 against Canada. In 2011, Japan displayed its progress by winning the 2011 IRB Pacific Nations Cup, played against Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. Further progress was displayed in 2014 when Japan completed a string of ten consecutive test wins (a record for a tier 2 team) to rank in the world's top 10 teams. This continued into 2015 where they produced the first of their three biggest upsets when, in a Rugby World Cup pool match against the Springboks, they won 34\u201332. \n In the years between, Japan faced quality opposition, playing relatively well with solid results including a tie against France, and a narrow loss to Wales at Cardiff. Their second shock win was a 19\u201312 defeat of world number-two ranked Ireland in a 2019 Rugby World Cup pool game. Emerging undefeated from the tournament's pool stage after a 28-21 victory over Scotland, Japan made their first ever World Cup quarter-final appearance, going down 3-26 to South Africa.",

The national team came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first Five Nations title outright in 1959. They won their first Grand Slam in 1968. Since then they have won the title outright 17 times, including nine grand slams, and shared it eight times.\n France has competed in every Rugby World Cup since it began in 1987, and qualified for the knock-out stage each time.

Following the schism of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. They first played against New Zealand in 1905, South Africa in 1906, and Australia in 1909.

The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys with white shorts, and their emblem is the native antelope springbok. The team has been representing South Africa in international rugby union since 30 July 1891, when they played their first test match against a British Isles touring team.\n Although South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition, the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 because of international anti-apartheid sporting boycotts. The team made its World Cup debut in 1995, when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament. The Springboks defeated the All Blacks 15\u201312 in the final, which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa's sporting history, and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process. South Africa regained the title as champions 12 years later, when they defeated England 15\u20136 in the 2007 final. As a result of the 2007 World Cup tournament the Springboks were promoted to first place in the IRB World Rankings, a position they held until July the following year when New Zealand regained the top spot.

Argentina has achieved several upset victories, are tough contenders when playing in Buenos Aires, and are capable of regularly defeating Six Nations sides. A surprise victory over the hosts France in the first game of the 2007 World Cup took Argentina to fourth in the IRB World Rankings.

They were defeated 37\u201313 by eventual winners South Africa in the semi-finals, but followed this up with a second win over France to claim third place overall. By the end of the competition, the team had reached an all-time high of third in the World Rankings.\n After their advances in competitiveness and performance during the 2000s, coupled with their location in the Southern Hemisphere, Argentina was the only tier 1 nation that had no regular competition, and some, among them former Pumas captain Agust\u00edn Pichot, had even spoken of them joining the Six Nations.

The match took place on 23 October 2011 at Eden Park, in Auckland, New Zealand. New Zealand won the match 8\u20137, the slimmest margin by which any Rugby World Cup final has been decided.\n New Zealand were favourites, as they went into the final unbeaten and the French had lost two pool games, including one to New Zealand. The French team also experienced a player revolt against their coach Marc Li\u00e8vremont, confirmed after the tournament by veteran back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy. The match was a close-fought and tight contest with few line-breaks. Each side scored one try and the outcome was determined by kicks \u2013 the All Blacks kicked a penalty goal while the French managed only the conversion of their try. The result was the lowest score of any World Cup final.\n The match echoed the 1987 Rugby World Cup Final which was also held at Eden Park between the same teams. As in the 2007 final, both teams had progressed from the same pool.\n New Zealand's victory marked the first time that a nation had held both the men's World Cup and Women's Rugby World Cup, as the Black Ferns had won the 2010 tournament.",

He become famous after his feeding behaviour was used to correctly predict the winner of each of the New Zealand national rugby union team's matches at the 2011 Rugby World Cup. His role at the 2011 Rugby World Cup has been compared to that of Paul the Octopus at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n Sonny Wool\u2019s owner is Beverley Dowling. His agent is Dan Boyd, who also designed the sheep\u2019s prediction process. The prediction process was designed so that Sonny Wool was presented with two boxes containing feed in the form of hay, each box marked on the outside with the flag of a national rugby union team in a forthcoming match. His choice of which hay to eat first was interpreted as indicating his prediction of a win for the country whose flag was on that box. Selections by the sheep have been correct in all of New Zealand\u2019s matches in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, though predictions for the other three quarter-finals turned out to be incorrect.\n Sonny Wool has his own website, Facebook and Twitter accounts. He was reported to be under 24-hour security watch after receiving death threats."
