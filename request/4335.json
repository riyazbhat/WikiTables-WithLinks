  "/wiki/Wind_of_Change_(Scorpions_song)": "Wind of Change is a power ballad by the German rock band Scorpions, recorded for their eleventh studio album, Crazy World (1990). The song was composed and written by the band's lead singer Klaus Meine and produced by Keith Olsen and the band. The lyrics were composed by Meine during the band's visit to the USSR at the height of perestroika, when the enmity between the communist and capitalist blocs subsided concurrently with the promulgation of large-scale socioeconomic reforms in the USSR. It was released as the album's third single in January 1991 and became a worldwide hit, just after the failed coup that would eventually lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The song topped the charts in Germany and across Europe and peaked at number four in the United States on August 31, 1991 and number two in the United Kingdom. It later appeared on the band's 1995 live album Live Bites, their 2000 album with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Moment of Glory, and on their 2001 unplugged album Acoustica. The band also recorded a Russian-language version of the song, under the title \u0412\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d (Veter Peremen)\n\n and a Spanish version called Vientos de Cambio. With estimated sales of 14 million copies sold worldwide, Wind of Change is one of the best-selling singles of all time.",
