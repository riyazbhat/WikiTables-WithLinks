Mizraab's debut album is considered by many to be the first progressive rock album in Pakistan.\n The album was recorded and composed by founder, lead vocalist and guitarist Faraz Anwar. According to Faraz, the album was an experiment in exploring new musical styles, as the album contains fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship blending with eastern classical music like the use of tablas and traditional Pakistani folk music elements. Panchi was not a commercial success. However, the release of the album earned the band a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim and thus the album was regarded as the first progressive rock album in the country.",
