  "/wiki/James_Chadwin": "James Armstrong Chadwin QC (7 June 1930 \u2013 16 January 2006) was a prominent British barrister, whose cases included defending Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. Chadwin was born in Glasgow and educated at the High School of Glasgow, Glasgow University (where he read modern languages and met the woman he was to marry) and Jesus College, Oxford. Whilst at Oxford, he was active as an actor and director in university theatre and also joined the Oxford University Air Squadron. He then spent six years in the Royal Air Force as an education officer at RAF Sandwich, his eyesight not being good enough to enable him to be a pilot. He was then called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1958 and joined chambers in Newcastle upon Tyne where his contemporaries included Peter Taylor, later Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Chadwin practised mainly in the field of criminal law and became a Queen's Counsel in 1976. He also became a Recorder in the same year, presiding over some trials at the Old Bailey. He was later appointed a Bencher of Gray's Inn and, in 1988, Leader of the Northern Circuit.",
  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Barristers are distinguished from solicitors, who have more direct access to clients, and may do transactional-type legal work. It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges, and they are rarely hired by clients directly. In some legal systems, including those of Scotland, South Africa, Scandinavia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title. In a few jurisdictions, barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation, and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor, who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court, and drafting court documents. In England and Wales, barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation.",
  "/wiki/Yorkshire_Ripper": "Peter William Sutcliffe (born 2 June 1946), also known as Peter William Coonan, is a prolific English serial killer who was dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper by the press. On 22 May 1981, Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, which was increased to a whole life order in 2010. All except two of his murders took place in West Yorkshire; the others were in Manchester. Sutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas, but appears to have moved to red light districts because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes. Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. He carried out murders over five years, including women who were not prostitutes. After his arrest in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police for driving with false number plates in January 1981, he was transferred to West Yorkshire Police, who questioned him about the killings.",

  "/wiki/Serjeant-at-law": "A Serjeant-at-Law (SL), commonly known simply as a Serjeant, was a member of an order of barristers at the English and Irish bar. The position of Serjeant-at-Law (servientes ad legem), or Sergeant-Counter, was centuries old; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France before the Norman Conquest. The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England, having been brought into existence as a body by Henry II. The order rose during the 16th century as a small, elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts. With the creation of Queen's Counsel (or Queen's Counsel Extraordinary) during the reign of Elizabeth I, the order gradually began to decline, with each monarch opting to create more King's or Queen's Counsel. The Serjeants' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century and, with the Judicature Act 1873 coming into force in 1875, it was felt that there was no need to have such figures, and no more were created. The last appointed was Nathaniel Lindley, later a Law Lord, who retired in 1905 and died in 1921. The number of Irish Serjeants-at-law was limited to three (originally one, later two).",
