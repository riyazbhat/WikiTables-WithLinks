  "/wiki/James_Chadwin": "James Armstrong Chadwin QC (7 June 1930 \u2013 16 January 2006) was a prominent British barrister, whose cases included defending Peter Sutcliffe, the \"Yorkshire Ripper\".\n Chadwin was born in Glasgow and educated at the High School of Glasgow, Glasgow University (where he read modern languages and met the woman he was to marry) and Jesus College, Oxford.  Whilst at Oxford, he was active as an actor and director in university theatre and also joined the Oxford University Air Squadron. He then spent six years in the Royal Air Force as an education officer at RAF Sandwich, his eyesight not being good enough to enable him to be a pilot.\n He was then called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1958 and joined chambers in Newcastle upon Tyne where his contemporaries included Peter Taylor, later Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Chadwin practised mainly in the field of criminal law and became a Queen's Counsel in 1976. He also became a Recorder in the same year, presiding over some trials at the Old Bailey. He was later appointed a Bencher of Gray's Inn and, in 1988, Leader of the Northern Circuit.\n Chadwin represented Peter Sutcliffe in 1981. Sutcliffe had admitted killing 13 women and attempting to kill seven others. Four psychiatrists reported on Sutcliffe and diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia, and Sir Michael Havers QC, the Attorney-General, was prepared to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. However, the trial judge, Mr Justice Boreham, refused to accept this plea and so Sutcliffe was tried for murder. Chadwin's attempts to secure a manslaughter verdict failed, although the jury returned a majority verdict of 10:2 reflecting doubts that two jurors had.\n Apart from Sutcliffe, his clients included Anthony Arkwright, who committed four murders in an apparent attempt to emulate Sutcliffe. He also represented Donna Anthony, who was convicted of killing her two children. The prosecution relied on evidence from Professor Sir Roy Meadow, whose evidence was later discredited. Chadwin appeared unsuccessfully for Donna Anthony on her first appeal, but illness prevented him representing her on her second, successful, appeal. Amongst his civil cases, Miller v. Jackson was a Court of Appeal decision on whether a cricket club was liable in nuisance and negligence to neighbouring residents when sixes were hit by players into their garden. Chadwin represented the neighbours and obtained an award of damages, although the injunction that had been granted at trial against the cricket club was overturned on appeal.\n Chadwin, who was married with four children, died in 2006. His obituary in The Times described him in this way:",
  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions.\n Barristers are distinguished from solicitors, who have more direct access to clients, and may do transactional-type legal work. It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges, and they are rarely hired by clients directly. In some legal systems, including those of Scotland, South Africa, Scandinavia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title.\n In a few jurisdictions, barristers are usually forbidden from \"conducting\" litigation, and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor, who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court, and drafting court documents. In England and Wales, barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation. This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity', fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor.\n In some countries with common law legal systems, such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia, lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors, but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister.",
  "/wiki/Yorkshire_Ripper": "Peter William Sutcliffe (born 2 June 1946), also known as Peter William Coonan, is a prolific English serial killer who was dubbed the \"Yorkshire Ripper\" by the press. On 22 May 1981, Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, which was increased to a whole life order in 2010. All except two of his murders took place in West Yorkshire; the others were in Manchester.\n Sutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas, but appears to have moved to red light districts because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes. Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. He carried out murders over five years, including women who were not prostitutes. After his arrest in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police for driving with false number plates in January 1981, he was transferred to West Yorkshire Police, who questioned him about the killings. He confessed to being the perpetrator, saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. At his trial, Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility, but he was convicted of murder on a majority verdict. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother's maiden name of Coonan. \n West Yorkshire Police were criticised for their failure to catch Sutcliffe despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of their five-year investigation. Because of the sensational nature of the case, the police handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading (including the Wearside Jack hoax recorded message and letters purporting to be from the \"Ripper\"). Following Sutcliffe's conviction, the government ordered a review of the investigation, conducted by Lawrence Byford, known as the \"Byford Report\". The findings were made fully public in 2006 and confirmed the validity of the criticism against the force. The report led to changes to investigative procedures which were adopted across UK police forces. In 2019, The Guardian described the manhunt as \"stunningly mishandled\".\n Sutcliffe was transferred from prison to a high-security psychiatric hospital in March 1984 after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The High Court dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life order and never be released from custody. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and he was transferred that month to HM Prison Frankland in Durham.",

The position of Serjeant-at-Law (servientes ad legem), or Sergeant-Counter, was centuries old; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France before the Norman Conquest. The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England, having been brought into existence as a body by Henry II. The order rose during the 16th century as a small, elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts. With the creation of Queen's Counsel (or \"Queen's Counsel Extraordinary\") during the reign of Elizabeth I, the order gradually began to decline, with each monarch opting to create more King's or Queen's Counsel. The Serjeants' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century and, with the Judicature Act 1873 coming into force in 1875, it was felt that there was no need to have such figures, and no more were created. The last appointed was Nathaniel Lindley, later a Law Lord, who retired in 1905 and died in 1921. The number of Irish Serjeants-at-law was limited to three (originally one, later two). The last appointment was A. M. Sullivan in 1912; after his 1921 relocation to the English bar he remained \"Serjeant Sullivan\" as a courtesy title.\n The Serjeants had for many centuries exclusive jurisdiction over the Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed to argue a case there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath.
