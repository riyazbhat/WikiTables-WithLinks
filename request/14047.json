  "/wiki/Chinworth_Bridge": "The bridge is significant locally as the only Pratt through truss bridge remaining in Kosciusko County, and is important regionally as one of the few surviving spans built by the Bellefontaine Bridge and Iron Company. Just west of the bridge was a ford across the Tippecanoe River. The Yellowstone Trail passed on the south side of the river. A marker has been maintained at this location. A post with yellows bands and a \"Y\" in a black circle In 1884, a new bridge across the Tippecanoe River was requested to connect Warsaw, on the south with a to Atwood and Etna Green on the north. It crossed the property of Robert Chinworth. Capt. David Braden working for the Bellefontaine Bridge and Iron Company agreed to erect a 140 feet (43 m) span over the Tippecanoe River, at a total cost of $2520.00.",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_30": "U.S. Route 30 or U.S. Highway 30 (US 30) is an east\u2013west main route in the system of the United States Numbered Highways, with the highway traveling across the northern tier of the country. With a length of 3,073 miles (4,946 km), it is the third longest U.S. highway, after U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 6. The western end of the highway is at US 101 in Astoria, Oregon; the eastern end is at Virginia Avenue, Absecon Boulevard, and Adriatic Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Despite long stretches of parallel and concurrent Interstate Highways, it has not been decommissioned unlike other long haul routes such as U.S. Route 66. The \"0\" as the last number in the digit indicates that it is a coast-to-coast route and a major east-west route. Much of the historic Lincoln Highway, the first road across America (from New York City to San Francisco), became part of US 30; it is still known by that name in many areas. US 30 and US 20 break the general U.S. Route numbering guidelines in Oregon, since US 20 actually starts south of US 30 in Newport, Oregon and US 30 runs parallel to the north throughout the state (the Columbia River and Interstate 84). The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell, Idaho.",
  "/wiki/Tippecanoe_River": "The Tippecanoe River (/\u02cct\u026apik\u0259\u02c8nu\u02d0/ TIP-ee-k\u0259-NOO) is a gentle, 182-mile-long (293 km) river in the Central Corn Belt Plains ecoregion in northern Indiana. It flows from Big Lake in Noble County to the Wabash River near what is now Battle Ground, about 12 miles (19 km) northeast of Lafayette. The name \"Tippecanoe\" was derived from a Miami-Illinois word for buffalo fish, reconstructed as */kiteepihkwana/ or as kiteepihkwana siipiiwi.\n The Tippecanoe River is fed by 88 natural lakes and has a drainage area of 1,250,000 acres (5,100 km2), spanning 14 counties. It supports more numerous imperiled species and overall species diversity than most streams of the upper Midwest. The Nature Conservancy has identified it as one of the top ten rivers in the United States to preserve due to its ecological diversity and the high proportion of endangered species found in it.",

  "/wiki/Conrail": "Conrail (formally the Consolidated Rail Corporation, with reporting mark CR) was the primary Class I railroad in the Northeastern United States between 1976 and 1999. The trade name Conrail is a portmanteau based on the company's legal name, and while it no longer operates trains, it continues to do business as an asset management and network services provider in three Shared Assets Areas that were excluded from the division of its operations during its acquisition by CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Railway. The Federal Government created Conrail to take over the potentially-profitable lines of multiple bankrupt carriers, including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway. After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act, Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987. The two remaining Class I railroads in the East, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts (alongside three residual shared-assets areas), returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central. Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board, CSX and NS took control in August 1998, and on June 1, 1999, began operating their respective portions of Conrail. The old company remains a jointly-owned subsidiary, with CSX and NS owning respectively 42 percent and 58 percent of its stock, corresponding to how much of Conrail's assets they acquired.
