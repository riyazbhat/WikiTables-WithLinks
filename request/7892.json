  "/wiki/Acraman_crater": "Acraman crater is a deeply eroded impact crater in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia. Its location is marked by Lake Acraman, a circular ephemeral playa lake about 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) in diameter. The discovery of the crater and independent discovery of its ejecta were first reported in the journal Science in 1986. The evidence for impact includes the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz in shattered bedrock on islands within Lake Acraman.",
  "/wiki/South_Australia": "South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres (379,725\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories by area, and fifth largest by population. It has a total of 1.7\u00a0million people, and its population is the second most highly centralised in Australia, after Western Australia, with more than 77 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small; Mount Gambier, the second largest centre, has a population of 28,684.",
  "/wiki/Amelia_Creek_crater": "Amelia Creek crater is an impact structure (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant of a former impact crater, located in the Davenport Range, Northern Territory, Australia. It lies within a low range of Paleoproterozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which are extensively folded and faulted, thus making an eroded impact crater difficult to recognize. It was only discovered by the identification of shatter cones near its centre. The central shatter cone locality is surrounded by a 20 by 12\u00a0km (12.4 by 7.5\u00a0mi) area of anomalous deformation, the asymmetry being possibly related to very oblique impact, but may be at least partly due to the pre-existing structural complexity of the rocks. This deformed zone gives the best estimate for the original size of the crater. Impact took place after folding of the Paleoproterozoic rocks but before deposition of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian rocks which overlie them, thus constraining the impact event to the interval between about 1660 and 600 Ma.",
  "/wiki/Northern_Territory": "The Northern Territory (NT; formally the Northern Territory of Australia) is an Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory looks out to the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria, including Western New Guinea and other Indonesian islands. The NT covers 1,349,129 square kilometres (520,902\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world.

  "/wiki/Boxhole_crater": "Boxhole is a young impact crater located approximately 180\u00a0km (265\u00a0km by road) north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia. It is 170 metres in diameter and its age is estimated to be 5,400 \u00b1 1,500 years based on the cosmogenic 14C terrestrial age of the meteorite, placing it in the Holocene. The crater is exposed to the surface.",

It lies adjacent to the Talawana Track 45\u00a0km west of the junction (Windy Corner) with the Gary Highway, but is difficult to access due to the remoteness of the area. It was originally thought to be a diapir (salt dome); an impact origin was first proposed in 1985.,",

  "/wiki/Dalgaranga_crater": "Dalgaranga crater is a small meteorite impact crater located on Dalgaranga pastoral station 75\u00a0km northwest of Mount Magnet (or north of Yalgoo) in Western Australia. It is only 24 m in diameter and 3 m deep, making it Australia's smallest impact crater (with exception of the smallest members of the Henbury crater field). Though discovered in 1921, it was not reported in the scientific literature until 1938. The bedrock at the site is weathered Archaean granite of the Yilgarn Craton. The discovery of fragments of mesosiderite stony-iron meteorite around the crater confirms an impact origin, making this crater unique as the only one known to have been produced by a mesosiderite projectile.",

  "/wiki/Foelsche_crater": "Foelsche is a partly buried impact structure (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant of a former impact crater. It is situated about 85\u00a0km southeast of Borroloola in the Northern Territory, Australia, and named after the nearby Foelsche River. Although little of it is exposed at the surface, and no crater shaped topography is evident, the circular nature of the feature is obvious on aeromagnetic images, a factor that led to its discovery.",
  "/wiki/Glikson_crater": "Glikson crater is an impact structure (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant of a former impact crater, situated in the Little Sandy Desert of central Western Australia. A possible impact structure was first reported in 1997, and named after Australian geologist A. Y. Glikson, attention to the site being drawn by the presence of a prominent 14\u00a0km diameter ring-shaped aeromagnetic anomaly. The area within the ring contains sparse outcrop of uplifted and deformed Neoproterozoic sandstone, but is largely covered by sand dunes. The recent discovery of shatter cones and microscopic shock effects is reliable evidence for an impact origin. Deformation of the sandstone consistent with an impact origin extends out to a diameter of 19\u00a0km, which is the best estimate for the original diameter of the original crater. The ring-shaped aeromagnetic anomaly was probably caused by disruption of a horizontal layer of magnetic igneous rock, known as a sill, by the impact event. Nearby outcrops of dolerite have been dated at 508 \u00b1 5 Ma (Middle\nCambrian), and if this is the same rock causing the aeromagnetic anomaly, then the impact must be younger, probably of Paleozoic age.",
  "/wiki/Goat_Paddock_crater": "Goat Paddock is a 5\u00a0km-diameter near-circular bowl-shaped depression in a range of gently dipping Proterozoic sandstone in  the Kimberley Region of northern Western Australia, 106\u00a0km west-southwest of Halls Creek. It is interpreted  as an ancient meteorite impact crater, the evidence including breccia containing melted rocks, silica glass, shatter cones and shocked quartz. Drilling shows that the crater is filled with about 200 m of ancient lake sediments containing Early Eocene pollen, this age thus giving a minimum estimate for the age of the crater itself. The crater is not perfectly circular, but slightly elongated in a north\u2013south direction, suggesting that the projectile struck at low angle from either the north or south.",
  "/wiki/Gosses_Bluff_crater": "Gosses Bluff (or Gosse's Bluff) is thought to be the eroded remnant of an impact crater.

  "/wiki/Goyder_crater": "Goyder is an impact structure (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant of a former impact crater. It is situated in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Australia, and was named after the nearby Goyder River. The impact occurred into Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the McArthur Basin. The deformed area is exposed at the surface and marked by a 3\u00a0km diameter ring of fractured and faulted sandstone, which is interpreted as the eroded relic of a central uplift (material that rebounded within the crater to once form a central peak); the original crater rim, long since removed by erosion, being estimated at approximately 9\u201312\u00a0km diameter. Evidence for an impact origin includes the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz in outcrops of deformed sandstone at the center of the site.",

  "/wiki/Mount_Toondina_crater": "Mount Toondina crater is an impact structure (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant of a former impact crater, located in northern South Australia in the locality of Allandale Station about 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) south of the town of Oodnadatta. Mount Toondina is the high point of a circular topographic feature rising out of an otherwise relatively flat desert area of the Eromanga Basin. An impact origin was first suggested in 1976, challenging the earlier diapir (salt dome) hypothesis, and strongly supported by subsequent studies. A geophysical survey using gravity methods indicates an internal structure typical of complex impact craters, including an uplifted centre, and suggests that the original crater was about 3\u20134\u00a0km in diameter. The crater must be younger than the Early Cretaceous age of the rocks in which it is situated, but otherwise is not well dated. It has clearly undergone significant erosion since the impact event.",
