Located in Exeter, New Hampshire, it is one of the oldest secondary schools in the United States. Exeter is based on the Harkness education system, a conference format of student interaction with minimal teacher involvement. It has the largest endowment of any New England boarding school, which as of 2018 was valued at $1.3 billion. On January 25, 2019, William K.

He is the 4th alumnus of Exeter to serve as Principal Instructor, after Gideon Lane Soule (1838\u20131873), Harlan Amen (1895 \u20131913), and William Saltonstall (1946\u20131963).\n Phillips Exeter Academy has educated several generations of the New England establishment and prominent American politicians, but has introduced many programs to diversify the student population, including need-blind admission. In 2018, over 45% of students received financial aid from grants totaling over $22 million. The school has been historically highly selective, with an acceptance rate of 15% for the 2019\u20132020 school year, and approximately 30% of graduates attend an Ivy League university, Stanford University, or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n Management of the school's financial and physical resources is overseen by trustees drawn from alumni. Day-to-day operations are headed by a principal, who is appointed by the trustees. The faculty of the school are responsible for governing matters relating to student life, both in and out of the classroom.\n The school's first enrolled class counted 56 boys; in 1970, when the decision was made to implement co-education, there were 700 boys. The 2018 academic year saw enrollment at 1,096 students, with 883 boarding students and 213 day students. The students comprise roughly equal numbers of males and females, who are housed in 25 single-sex and two mixed-sex dormitories.

Ernest Hemingway never met Baker, according to Hemingway's fourth wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway, who also asserts in her 1976 book \"How It Was\" that Hemingway deliberately chose someone who never knew him.  Mary does not offer a specific reason for this choice, but Baker had published \"Hemingway: The Writer as Artist\" in 1952, which favorably treated Hemingway's work to that date.\n Baker's other major works include biographies of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n Baker taught biographer A. Scott Berg while Berg was an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1960s.  Berg recalled that Baker \"changed my life,\" and convinced him to quit acting to concentrate on his thesis, a study of editor Maxwell Perkins.

  "/wiki/Colonial_America": "The colonial history of the United States covers the history of European colonization of America from the early 16th century until the incorporation of the colonies into the United States of America. In the late 16th century, England, France, Spain, and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in America. The death rate was very high among those who arrived first, and some early attempts disappeared altogether, such as the English Lost Colony of Roanoke. Nevertheless, successful colonies were established within several decades. \n European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups, including adventurers, farmers, indentured servants, tradesmen, and a few from the aristocracy.  Settlers included the Dutch of New Netherland, the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden, the English Quakers of the Province of Pennsylvania, the English Puritans of New England, the English settlers of Jamestown, Virginia, the English Catholics and Protestant non-conformists of the Province of Maryland, the \"worthy poor\" of the Province of Georgia, the Germans who settled the mid-Atlantic colonies, and the Ulster Scots people of the Appalachian Mountains. These groups all became part of the United States when it gained its independence in 1776. Russian America and parts of New France and New Spain were also incorporated into the United States at various points. The diverse groups from these various regions built colonies of distinctive social, religious, political, and economic style.\n Over time, non-British colonies East of the Mississippi River were taken over and most of the inhabitants were assimilated. In Nova Scotia, however, the British expelled the French Acadians, and many relocated to Louisiana. No civil wars occurred in the thirteen colonies. The two chief armed rebellions were short-lived failures in Virginia in 1676 and in New York in 1689\u201391. Some of the colonies developed legalized systems of slavery, centered largely around the Atlantic slave trade. Wars were recurrent between the French and the British during the French and Indian Wars. By 1760, France was defeated and its colonies were seized by Britain.\n On the eastern seaboard, the four distinct English regions were New England, the Middle Colonies, the Chesapeake Bay Colonies (Upper South), and the Southern Colonies (Lower South). Some historians add a fifth region of the Frontier, which was never separately organized. A significant percentage of the Indians living in the eastern region had been ravaged by disease before 1620, possibly introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors (although no conclusive cause has ever been established).",

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863, it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents, known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, spread throughout most of the world's countries and territories.\n It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion, whose founder (the B\u00e1b) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h (1817\u20131892) announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine. Following Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (1844\u20131921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897\u20131957). Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community, which sits in Haifa, Israel, near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b.\n Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is considered single and all-powerful. However, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings is the goal of a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.\n Letters written by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h to various individuals, including some heads of state, have been collected and assembled into a canon of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture that includes works by his son \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, and also the B\u00e1b, who is regarded as Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's forerunner.

  "/wiki/Trigonometry": "Trigonometry (from Greek trig\u014dnon, \"triangle\" and metron, \"measure\") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. The Greeks focused on the calculation of chords, while mathematicians in India created the earliest-known tables of values for  trigonometric ratios (also called trigonometric functions) such as sine.\n Throughout history, trigonometry has been applied in areas such as geodesy, surveying, celestial mechanics, and navigation.\n Trigonometry is known for its many identities, which are equations used for rewriting trigonometrical expressions to solve equations, to find a more useful expression, or to discover new relationships.",
