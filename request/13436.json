These codes, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization and published in ICAO Document 7910: Location Indicators, are used by air traffic control and airline operations such as flight planning. ICAO codes are also used to identify other aviation facilities such as weather stations, International Flight Service Stations or Area Control Centers, whether or not they are located at airports. Flight information regions are also identified by a unique ICAO-code.",
  "/wiki/IATA_airport_code": "An IATA airport code, also known as an IATA location identifier, IATA station code or simply a location identifier, is a three-letter geocode designating many airports and metropolitan areas around the world, defined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The characters prominently displayed on baggage tags attached at airport check-in desks are an example of a way these codes are used. The assignment of these codes is governed by IATA Resolution 763, and it is administered by the IATA's headquarters in Montreal. The codes are published semi-annually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory. IATA also provides codes for railway stations and for airport handling entities. A list of airports sorted by IATA code is available. A list of railway station codes, shared in agreements between airlines and rail lines such as Amtrak, SNCF French Railways, and Deutsche Bahn, is available. Many railway administrations have their own list of codes for their stations, such as the list of Amtrak station codes.",
  "/wiki/B\u00e9tou": "B\u00e9tou is a town on the right bank of the Ubangi River in the Likouala Department, Republic of the Congo. B\u00e9tou is a sous-prefecture and has its own mayor. It is the border town with the Central African Republic (CAR), approximately 90 km (56 mi) from the border by road or 45 km (28 mi) by river. The town is linked to Bangui, the capital of CAR, by a relatively good road but suffers from very poor road access to the south of the Republic of Congo, with the vast majority of travelers arriving by river. The town has a disused air-strip (IATA: BTB, ICAO: FCOT). The town is dominated by a large Italian-run timber factory which is the area's major employer. Since late 2009, according to the UNHCR, the district of B\u00e9tou accommodates around 57,000 refugees who have fled the Dongo conflict in the \u00c9quateur Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (directly opposite across the Ubangi River), of whom just over 10,000 live in the town of B\u00e9tou, with the rest spread throughout small riverside villages.

Rumours abound of a police force and sets of soldiers more corrupt than in other parts of the Congo, probably due to its remoteness, in addition to being so close to the Democratic Republic of Congo over the river. Soldiers from the DR Congo have been known to cross and harass the population on occasion, making people here more on edge than usual.
