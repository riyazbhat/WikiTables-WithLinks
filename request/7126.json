  "/wiki/Wesley_United_Methodist_Church_(Austin,_Texas)": "The Wesley United Methodist Church in Austin, Texas, United States, was founded in 1865, at the end of the American Civil War.  Its original members were Austin-area freedmen, and it remains a predominantly African-American congregation. On March 4, 1865, the Reverend Joseph Welch, Presiding Elder of the Texas District of the Mississippi Mission Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, presided over the meeting at which Wesley was founded.  This historical meeting was held in the basement of the old Tenth Street M. E. Church, South in Austin, Texas.\n The day following the founding of Wesley, the first Quarterly Conference of the new church was held. The first trustees were Milton Wright, Thomas Merridy, Tom King, Simon Dedrick, Grant Woods, Henry Shelly, Samuel Hamilton, and Reverend Isaac Wright.  Isaac Wright was also the first pastor of Wesley.  This tenure of service covered the formative period from March 1865 to January 1868.\n The West Texas Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized on January 22, 1874.  Included among the ministers present at the organizational meeting of the Conference was the first pastor of Wesley, Isaac Wright.\n When the church was opened for membership at least 275 persons joined. Assisting Wright were the ministers Friend, Spencer Hardwell, and John Boyd, each of whom subsequently served as pastor of Wesley. These ministers and the Rev. B. F. Williams led the congregation during the nine years from the founding of the church until the organization of the West Texas Conference in 1874.\n The first church building was erected under the leadership of Bishop Abraham Grant and the Rev. B. F. Williams, who served as pastor in 1874-75.  This church was located in what is now downtown Austin, on the corner of Fourth Street and Congress Avenue.  One historical account of the Wesley of that day includes the following  description:\n \"The dimensions were about 40x60 feet.\"  The floor was of dirt.  The steps were logwood.  The seating capacity was small.  The benches were made of slab board. There was a lamp irregularly kept, fastened to the side of the wall.  When this lamp was installed in place of the individual candles, there was great rejoicing.\"\n As Wesley progressed, it broadened its scope and attracted new members, and in less than two decades a larger building was needed; in the spring of 1882, the cornerstone was laid for a new church at the corner of Ninth and Neches Streets.  This building, containing approximately twice the floor space of the \"First Wesley,\" was completed at an estimated cost of US$22,000, exclusive of church furniture valued at over $2,500.\n The new church had a pastor's study, a library for Sunday School books and literature, choir materials, and a six-room parsonage for the minister.  For several years Samuel Huston College (now Huston\u2013Tillotson University) held most of its classes in the church.\n By the end of the second decade of the 20th century, not only had Wesley Methodist Church grown, but also the city of Austin had become a major urban community in Central Texas.  There was a need to expand the facilities of the Austin Public Schools.  Therefore, in 1928, the Austin School Board acquired the properties of the church for $17,500.  Earlier, under the ministerial leadership of the Reverend L. H. Richardson, the church purchased a plot of ground facing Hackberry, Navasota, and San Bernard Streets for future use.\n Under the pastoral administration of the Rev. W. L. Turner, a new church (\"Greater Wesley\") was built at this East Austin location at a cost of approximately $50,000, supported by the members of the church with the cooperation of the citizens of Austin.  \n Wesley Methodist Church became Wesley United Methodist Church in 1968 at the time of the general church merge.\n Wesley United Methodist Church was the founding institution for the Austin Area Urban League, incorporated in the mid 1970s under the leadership of the Rev. Freddie B. Dixon, Sr., First Board Chairman, Bertrand Adam, Linda Moore Smith, and Wesley members who served on the founding committee.  A Special Task Force was set up to help alleviate the high suspension rate of African-American students in the Austin Independent School District.  The Task Force met with the Austin Independent School District Officials and offered to do a joint venture project to alleviate the suspension problem in the public schools.  Wesley obtained a private grant from the Kellogg Foundation and started the Wesley Center housed on the church grounds in co-operation with the Austin Independent School District.  Texas Legislatures passed new laws regarding suspension centers in the public schools.  The Wesley Center relocated to the Rosewood Elementary School, later renamed the F. R.Rice School.\n The Church continued formed another Special Task Force in the 1980s headed by the Rev. Freddie B Dixon, Sr., members of Wesley and community leaders, under the auspices of the Forming the Future Bond Project of the Austin Independent School District.  The purpose of the Task Force was to address the Court Order Decision for a new Kealing Junior High School in the Austin community.  The African-American community of Austin did not want the African-American junior high to be closed, so the task force was responsible for developing a plan of action for the construction of a new Kealing Junior High School.  The Task Force presented a detailed Master Plan for the construction of a new Kealing Junior High on the site of the existing facility.  The Master Plan for a new Kealing was adopted by the Austin Independent School District Trustees to be included in the Forming the Future Bond Package which was approved and passed by the voters of the Austin community.  A new Kealing Junior High School was built.\n Wesley United Methodist Church during the 1970s and 1980s developed a Church Master Plan for renovating the historical church structure and acquisition of adjacent land.  This Master Plan was begun in the early 1980, extending beyond 2000. The task was completed without borrowing, to the extent that over ten years, over $200,000 was raised in cash by Wesley members.  Adjacent properties were acquired during this period, and membership grew.\n Bishop Ernest T. Dixon was named the first African-American leader of the Southwest Texas Conference. His son, Dr. Freddie B, Dixon, Sr., pastor of Wesley United Methodist Church, led the dedication ceremonies on February 13, 1983.\n In 1985 Wesley United Methodist Church was recognized as a National Site by the National Register of Historic Places. The United Methodist Church (Site No.126) recognized Wesley United Methodist Church as a Historic Structure.\n In 1988 the Wesley Endowment Fund was established to provide educational stipends to Wesley youth graduating from high school and preparing to enter higher education.  As of 2011[update] approximately 55 students had received stipends of $500 each. The scholarship program provides scholarships to children and grandchildren of members of Wesley.\n In 2003 Wesley United Methodist Church was designated a Five Star Church by the Southwest Texas Conference. New ministries were added, and an educational director named to develop programs for the youth and children of the church.\n WESLEY'S PASTORS",

The community of 209.3 square miles (542\u00a0km2), with a population of 47,743 in 2010, is the county seat of surrounding Galveston County and second-largest municipality in the county. It is also within the Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.\n Galveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez y Madrid, Count of G\u00e1lvez (1746\u20131786), who was born in Macharaviaya, M\u00e1laga, in the Kingdom of Spain. Galveston's first European settlements on the Galveston Island were built around 1816 by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury to help the fledgling Republic of Mexico fight for independence from Spain, along with other colonies in the  Western Hemisphere of the Americas in Central and South America in the 1810s and 1820s. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the  Republic of Texas.\n During the 19th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest ports in the United States. It was for a time, Texas' largest city, known as the \"Queen City of the Gulf\". It was devastated by the unexpected Galveston Hurricane of 1900, whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which nearly wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed barrier island is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the Prohibition era of 1919\u20131933 as a leading tourist hub and a center of illegal gambling, nicknamed the Free State of Galveston until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development.\n Much of Galveston's economy is centered in the tourism, health care, shipping, and financial industries. The 84-acre (34\u00a0ha) University of Texas Medical Branch campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city.

With an estimated 2018 population of 1,345,076, it is the ninth most-populous city in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. Located in North Texas, the city of Dallas is the main core of the largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States and the largest inland metropolitan area in the U.S. that lacks any navigable link to the sea.[a] It is the most populous city in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country at 7.5 million people.\n Dallas and nearby Fort Worth were initially developed due to the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to cotton, cattle and later oil in North and East Texas. The construction of the Interstate Highway System reinforced Dallas's prominence as a transportation hub, with four major interstate highways converging in the city and a fifth interstate loop around it. Dallas then developed as a strong industrial and financial center and a major inland port, due to the convergence of major railroad lines, interstate highways and the construction of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. In addition, Dallas has DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) with different colored train lines that transport throughout the metroplex.\n Dominant sectors of its diverse economy include defense, financial services, information technology, telecommunications, and transportation.

  "/wiki/List_of_Methodist_churches_in_the_United_States": "This is a list of Methodist churches in the United States.  It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense).  It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings.  This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard.  Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain.  In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray.  The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings.\n In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment.  The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches."
