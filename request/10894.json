  "/wiki/Alouatta_palliata": "The mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), or golden-mantled howling monkey, is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, from Central and South America. It is one of the monkey species most often seen and heard in the wild in Central America. It takes its \"mantled\" name from the long guard hairs on its sides.\n The mantled howler is one of the largest Central American monkeys, and males can weigh up to 9.8 kg (22 lb).  It is the only Central American monkey that eats large quantities of leaves; it has several adaptations to this folivorous diet. Since leaves are difficult to digest and provide less energy than most foods, the mantled howler spends the majority of each day resting and sleeping. The male mantled howler has an enlarged hyoid bone, a hollow bone near the vocal cords, which amplifies the calls made by the male, and is the reason for the name \"howler\". Howling allows the monkeys to locate each other without expending energy on moving or risking physical confrontation.\n The mantled howler lives in groups that can have over 40 members, although groups are usually smaller. Most mantled howlers of both sexes are evicted from the group they were born in upon reaching sexual maturity, resulting in most adult group members being unrelated. The most dominant male, the alpha male, gets preference for food and resting places, and mates with most of the receptive females. The mantled howler is important to the rainforest ecology as a seed disperser and germinator. Although it is affected by deforestation, it is able to adapt better than other species, due to its ability to feed on abundant leaves and its ability to live in a limited amount of space.",

The species definitely occurs in the Atlantic lowlands of Panama close to the Costa Rica border.\n The exact classification of the Panamanian Night Monkey is uncertain. While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey, A. lemurinus, other authors follow a study by Thomas Defler from 2001, which concluded that it is a separate species, A. zonalis.\n The Panamanian night monkey is a relatively small monkey, with males weighing approximately 889 grams (31.4 oz) and females weighing about 916 grams (32.3 oz).  The fur on the back ranges from grayish brown to reddish brown.  The belly is yellow.  The hair on the back of the hands and feet is black or dark brown, which is a key distinguishing feature from other northern \"gray-necked\" Aotus species; also, its hair is shorter.  Other distinguishing features relate to its skull, which has a broad braincase, a depressed interorbital region, and large molariform teeth.\n Like other night monkeys, the Panamanian night monkey has large eyes, befitting its nocturnal lifestyle.  But unlike many nocturnal animal species, its eyes do not have a tapetum lucidum. Also like other night monkeys, it has a short tail relative to the body size.\n The Panamanian night monkey is arboreal and nocturnal.  It and the other members of the genus Aotus are the only nocturnal monkeys.  It is found in several types of forest, including secondary forest and coffee plantations.  It lives in small groups of between two and six monkeys, consisting of an adult pair and one infant and several juveniles and/or subadults.  Groups are territorial, and groups occupy ranges that overlap only slightly.\n Vocal, olfactory and behavioral forms of communication have all been recorded.  At least nine vocal calls have been reported, including various types of grunts, screams, squeals, moans and trills.  Males develop a scent gland near their tail at the age of about one year that is used for scent marking. Urine washing, in which urine is rubbed on the hands and feet, is also used.  Behavioral communication appears to be less important than vocal and olfactory communication, but certain behavioral displays, including arched back displays, stiff legged jumping, urination, defecation and piloerection have been noted.\n The Panamanian night monkey generally walks on all four legs, although it is capable of leaping or running when necessary.  It eats a variety of foods.  In one study, on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, its diet was found to consist of 65% fruits, 30% leaves and 5% insects.\n In common with other night monkeys, the Panamanian night monkey is one of the few monogamous monkeys.  The monogamous pair generally gives birth to a single infant each year, although twins occasionally occur.  The gestation period is about 133 days.  The father carries the infant from the time it is one or two days old, passing it to the mother for nursing.\n Although viewing monkeys is popular with tourists visiting Panama, the Panamanian night monkey's nocturnal habits make it less often seen than the other Panamanian monkey species.

  "/wiki/Callitrichidae": "The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets, tamarins and lion tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.\n This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive lineage, from which all the larger-bodied platyrrhines evolved. However, some works argue that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage.\n Ancestral stem-callitrichids likely were \"normal-sized\" ceboids that were dwarfed through evolutionary time. This may exemplify a rare example of insular dwarfing in a mainland context, with the \"islands\" being formed by biogeographic barriers during arid climatic periods when forest distribution became patchy, and/or by the extensive river networks in the Amazon Basin.\n All callitrichids are arboreal. They are the smallest of the simian primates. They eat insects, fruit, and the sap or gum from trees; occasionally they take small vertebrates. The marmosets rely quite heavily on tree exudates, with some species (e.g. Callithrix jacchus and Cebuella pygmaea) considered obligate exudativores.\n Callitrichids typically live in small, territorial groups of about five or six animals. Their social organization is unique among primates and is called a \"cooperative polyandrous group\". This communal breeding system involves groups of multiple males and females, but only one female is reproductively active. Females mate with more than one male and each shares the responsibility of carrying the offspring.\n They are the only primate group that regularly produces twins, which constitute over 80% of births in species that have been studied. Unlike other male primates, male callitrichids generally provide as much parental care as females. Parental duties may include carrying, protecting, feeding, comforting, and even engaging in play behavior with offspring. In some cases, such as in the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), males, particularly those that are paternal, will even show a greater involvement in caregiving than females. The typical social structure seems to constitute a breeding group, with several of their previous offspring living in the group and providing significant help in rearing the young.",

Geoffroy's tamarin is the smallest Panamanian monkey, with an average size of about 0.5 kilograms (1.1 lb).\n One Panamanian monkey, the black-headed spider monkey, is considered to be critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and Geoffroy's spider monkey is considered to be endangered.  The Central American squirrel monkey was once considered endangered, but its conservation status was upgraded to vulnerable in 2008.  The Coiba Island howler is also considered to be vulnerable.  Three species, the mantled howler, the white-faeced capuchin and Geoffroy's tamarin are rated as \"least concern\" from a conservation standpoint."
