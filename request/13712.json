  "/wiki/As_the_World_Turns": "As the World Turns (often referred to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010. Irna Phillips created As the World Turns as a sister show to her other soap opera Guiding Light. Running for 54 years, As the World Turns holds the third-longest continuous run of any daytime network soap opera on American television, surpassed only by General Hospital and Guiding Light.[a] As the World Turns was produced for the first 43 years in Manhattan and in Brooklyn from 2000 until 2010.\n Set in the fictional town of Oakdale, Illinois, the show debuted on April 2, 1956, at 1:30 pm EST, airing as a 30-minute serial. Prior to that date, all serials had been 15 minutes in length. As the World Turns and The Edge of Night, which premiered on the same day at 4:30 pm EST, were the first two to be 30 minutes in length from their premiere. At first, viewers were indifferent to the new half-hour serial, but ratings picked up in its second year, eventually reaching the top spot in the daytime Nielsen ratings by fall 1958. In 1959, the show started a streak of weekly ratings wins that was not interrupted for over 12 years. The show switched to color on August 21, 1967, and expanded from a half-hour in length to one hour starting on December 1, 1975, when The Edge of Night moved to ABC. In the year-to-date ratings, As the World Turns was the most-watched daytime drama from 1958 until 1978, with ten million viewers tuning in each day. At its height, core actors such as Helen Wagner, Don MacLaughlin, Don Hastings, and Eileen Fulton became nationally known. Three of these actors \u2013 Wagner, Hastings, and Fulton \u2013 are also the three longest serving actors in the history of American soap operas.\n The show passed its 10,000th episode on May 12, 1995, and celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 2, 2006. On September 18, 2009, As the World Turns became the last remaining Procter & Gamble-produced soap opera for CBS after Guiding Light aired its final episode on the network.\n On December 8, 2009, CBS announced that it was canceling As the World Turns after a run of almost 54 years due to low ratings. The show taped its final scenes on June 23, 2010, and with a dramatic storyline finale, its final episode on the network aired on September 17, 2010. On October 18, 2010, CBS replaced As the World Turns with new talk show The Talk.",

  "/wiki/Fast_&_Furious_(2009_film)": "Fast & Furious (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 4) is a 2009 American-Japanese action adventure film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. The fourth installment in The Fast Saga, it is a direct sequel to The Fast and the Furious (2001), and stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz and Laz Alonso. Fast & Furious follows Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Brian O'Conner (Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Diesel) who are forced to work together to avenge the murder of Toretto's lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga (Ortiz).\n Fast & Furious marked the first film in the series since the original installment, The Fast and the Furious, to feature the main cast. As a result, this spawned a shift within the series' chronological order, with developers setting Fast & Furious between the second and third installments, to account for their absences. Casting began in July 2007, after Universal Studios confirmed the returns of Walker and Diesel, while principal photography began in Los Angeles in February 2008, with the film being shot in California.\nFast & Furious was released in the United States on April 3, 2009. The film achieved financial success, setting box office records for its opening-weekend and spring opening-weekend gross. It quickly became the highest-grossing film in the franchise, and eventually grossed over $363 million worldwide. The film was also the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2009.\n Despite its commercial success, Fast & Furious received negative reviews, with some critics singling out the performances of Diesel and Walker. The film's soundtrack and production were praised. A sequel, Fast Five, was released in April 2011 to box office success, surpassing Fast & Furious as the highest-grossing film in the franchise.",

A sequel to 2009's Fast & Furious, it is the fifth installment in The Fast Saga franchise and stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker,  Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson and Joaquim de Almeida. Fast Five follows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster) as they plan a heist to steal $100\u00a0million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes (de Almeida) while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).\n While developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist of $100\u00a0million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers and at NASCAR races.\n Fast Five was released first in Australia on April 20, 2011, and then in the United States on April 29, 2011. The film achieved financial success, breaking box office records for the highest-grossing April opening weekend and the second-highest spring opening weekend, and surpassing Fast & Furious to become the highest-grossing film in the franchise. Fast Five grossed over $625 million worldwide, making it number 66 on the all-time worldwide list of highest-grossing films, in unadjusted dollars, and the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2011.\n Fast Five received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the combination of comedy and \"action sequences that toy idly with the laws of physics\"; some labeled it the best film in the series. Johnson was singled out for praise in numerous reviews for his performance, with critics calling him \"the best thing, by far, in Fast Five\" and remarking that scenes shared by Johnson and Diesel were often the \"best moments\". Despite the positive response, many were critical of the film's running time, considering it too long, and others criticized the treatment of women, stating \"[Women] cameo strikingly in buttock form. Others actually have first names.\" South American reviewers were critical of the film's portrayal of Rio de Janeiro as a haven for drug trafficking and corruption, labeling it a \"stereotype\". A sequel, Fast & Furious 6, was released in May 2013 to box office success, surpassing Fast Five as the highest-grossing film in the franchise. Another sequel, Furious 7, released in April 2015, soon surpassed Fast & Furious 6, grossing over $1.5 billion worldwide.",
