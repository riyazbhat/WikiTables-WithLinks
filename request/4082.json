In 1911, Kinloch became the election agent for Josiah Wedgwood, Liberal Party MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, and immediately began setting up permanent organisation committees in each ward in Wedgwood's constituency. He built links with the local Labour Party, which encouraged its members to attend meeting where Wedgwood spoke on progressive issues, thereby reducing the influence of the right of the Liberal Party, who were hostile to Wedgwood. He became increasingly interested in the labour movement, and in 1914 joined the Independent Labour Party, principally due to its anti-war stance. Wedgwood, for the time being, remained with the Liberals, so Kinloch returned to Scotland, and became a schoolteacher.

The area had an ever-expanding population after 1945 as prosperous suburbs of Derby were built outside the city boundaries. Lord George-Brown, who represented the seat at the time, wrote in 1971 after his defeat in the 1970 general election that The electorate had increased by over 10,000 since 1966, mainly from the growth of middle-class housing estates, so that most of the new electors could be expected to vote Tory. Since my majority in 1966 was 4,274, an influx of 10,000 new voters, mainly Tory, obviously imperilled the seat.
