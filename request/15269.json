  "/wiki/Nameplate_capacity": "Nameplate capacity, also known as the rated capacity, nominal capacity, installed capacity, or maximum effect, is the intended  full-load sustained output of a facility such as a power plant, electric generator, a chemical plant, fuel plant, metal refinery, mine, and many others. Nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the power output of a power station usually expressed in megawatts (MW). Power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high capacity factor.",
  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \nk\ng\nm\n2\ns\n\u2212\n3\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",
  "/wiki/Wind_turbine": "A wind turbine, or alternatively referred to as a wind energy converter, is a device that converts the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy. Wind turbines are manufactured  in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs. Larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent  renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. One assessment claimed that, as of 2009[update], wind had the lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions, the least water consumption demands and... the most favourable social impacts compared to photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal and gas.",

The first V90-3MW was erected in northern Germany in May 2002. 15 test turbines were deployed around the world in different climatic conditions, so that when it went into production, the V90-3MW had been tested in more sites than the V80-2MW. Following a number of gearbox problems, the V90-3MW was withdrawn for offshore sales in early 2007 before being reissued for offshore use in May 2008."
