  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales, according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in. Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones, but some alternative scales also exist, such as accumulated cyclone energy, the Power Dissipation Index, the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index, and the Hurricane Severity Index.\n Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales. Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms. Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane, then it will be classified on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period. In the Western Pacific, the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin, which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period.\n The India Meteorological Department's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean, and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds. Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales, which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds: The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin. The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories, including New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft). However, the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) above the surface. The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.\n Within all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds reach at least 35\u00a0kn (40\u00a0mph; 65\u00a0km/h).",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Mahina": "Cyclone Mahina was the deadliest cyclone in recorded Australian history, and also likely the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. Mahina struck Bathurst Bay, Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, on 4 March 1899, and its winds and enormous storm surge combined to kill more than 300 people.\n While the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center of the basin, estimates Mahina's peak central pressure to be 914\u00a0hPa (26.99\u00a0inHg), the World Meteorological Organization is currently considering an application from Queensland scientists and researchers to have this value upgraded to 880\u00a0hPa (25.99\u00a0inHg), based on data from post-storm analysis. This would officially make Mahina the most intense cyclone recorded to have hit the Australian mainland, and the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, a title currently held by Cyclone Winston. Cyclone Mahina also produced the largest storm surge on record, generating a 13-metre (43-foot)-high surge.",

Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Tracking westward, the system attained gale-force winds by 18\u00a0March before striking the Cape York Peninsula. After crossing the area, Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development. On 22\u00a0March, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) with ten-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph). By this time, the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22\u00a0March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system. Once over land, Kathy rapidly degraded, losing gale-force winds within 24\u00a0hours; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24\u00a0March.\n Moving through the Pellew Islands as a powerful cyclone, Kathy generated a maximum storm surge of 4.2\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) and winds exceeding 232\u00a0km/h (144\u00a0mph). Offshore, 20 vessels were affected, one of which sank and resulted in the death of its captain. In mainland Australia, the system struck a relatively sparsely populated area, with only Borroloola being significantly impacted by the cyclone. Additionally, mangroves at along the McArthur River sustained substantial damage. Overall, losses from the storm were placed at A$12\u00a0million (A$30.5\u00a0million 2011\u00a0AUD; US$24.1\u00a0million 2011\u00a0USD).

Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28\u00a0December south of Nauru. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands, crossing the 160th\u00a0meridian east from the South Pacific basin into the Australian region. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category\u00a04\u00a0tropical cyclone on 2\u00a0January. It maintained this intensity for about 12\u00a0hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3\u00a0January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4\u00a0January, before it passed over New Caledonia between 5\u20136\u00a0January. After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10\u00a0January.\n Over the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea. Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay, Queensland, the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level trough on 18\u00a0January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20\u00a0January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to New Zealand three days later.\n The cyclone caused the deaths of 22\u00a0people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Eastern Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana dinghy en route to Rossel Island went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island.

Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2\u00a0April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. On 4\u00a0April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda.

As it moved to the west and later south as the result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions, the cyclone was able to rapidly intensify. John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category\u00a05 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale, the highest rating possible. Cyclone John later began interacting with a mid\u2013latitude trough, which slightly weakened the cyclone prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December. Increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in the cyclone's rapid weakening, before it dissipated during  the next day.\n Cyclone John extensively affected areas of Western Australia, but damage was not as bad as expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140\u00a0windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25\u00a0houses and caused rivers to overflow.

  "/wiki/List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones": "Winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds. However, variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult. In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damages, and tornadoes can vary significantly in storms with similar wind speeds. Pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because the measurements are easier and use consistent methodology. Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth. However, although there is a strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds, storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds, as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.\n In the most recent and reliable records, most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (mbar) (26.56\u00a0inHg) or less have occurred in the Western North Pacific Ocean. The strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central pressure, was Typhoon Tip, which reached a pressure of 870\u00a0hPa (25.69\u00a0inHg) on October 12, 1979. The following list is subdivided by basins. Data listed are provided by the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre, unless otherwise noted.
