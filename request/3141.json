  "/wiki/Jackson_Lake": "Jackson Lake is in Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming. This natural lake was enlarged by the construction of the Jackson Lake Dam, which was originally built in 1911, enlarged in 1916 and rebuilt by 1989. As part of the Minidoka Project the top 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) of the lake is used by farmers in Idaho for irrigation purposes under water rights legislation that was enacted prior to the establishment of Grand Teton National Park. The lake is the remnant of large glacial gouging from the neighboring Teton Range to the west and the Yellowstone Plateau to the north.  The lake is primarily fed by the Snake River, which flows in from the north, and empties at Jackson Lake Dam. Jackson Lake is one of the largest high altitude lakes in the United States, at an elevation of 6,772\u00a0ft (2,064\u00a0m) above sea level. The lake is up to 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) long, 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) wide and 438\u00a0ft (134\u00a0m) deep. The water of the lake averages below 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C), even during the summer.\n Numerous species of fish inhabit the lake including nonnative brown and lake trout and the native Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and mountain whitefish.\n There are over 15 islands in the lake, including the largest, Elk Island, and Donoho Point.\n John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway is located near the northern end of Jackson Lake and extends to the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. This roadway combines with the roads in Grand Teton National Park that follow the eastern side of the lake, and provides access for boating and fishing. There are several marinas and lodges along the eastern shore such as Leeks marina, Colter Bay Village, Jackson Lake Lodge and Signal Mountain Lodge. All of these except Jackson Lake Lodge have boat access points and ramps. The western shore of Jackson Lake is primitive, with only hiking trails and a handful of primitive campground spots.",

Situated just southeast of Mount Moran, the lake is at the terminus of both Paintbrush and Leigh Canyons.

  "/wiki/Yellowstone_Lake": "Yellowstone Lake is the largest body of water in Yellowstone National Park. The lake is 7,732 feet (2,357\u00a0m) above sea level and covers 136 square miles (350\u00a0km2) with 110 miles (180\u00a0km) of shoreline.

Yellowstone Lake is the largest freshwater lake above 7,000\u00a0ft (2,100\u00a0m) in North America.\n In winter, ice nearly 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) thick covers much of the lake except where shallow water covers hot springs. The lake freezes over by early December and can remain frozen until late May or early June.",
  "/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)": "The Green River, located in the western United States, is the chief tributary of the Colorado River. The watershed of the river, known as the Green River Basin, covers parts of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. The Green River is 730 miles (1,170\u00a0km) long, beginning in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming and flowing through Wyoming and Utah for most of its course, except for 40 miles (64\u00a0km) into western Colorado. Much of the route is through the Colorado Plateau and through some of the most spectacular canyons in the United States. It is only slightly smaller than the Colorado when the two rivers merge, but typically carries a larger load of silt. The average yearly mean flow of the river at Green River, Utah is 6,121 cubic feet (173.3\u00a0m3) per second.\n The status of the Green River as a tributary of the Colorado River came about for mainly political reasons.  In earlier nomenclature, the Colorado River began at its confluence with the Green River. Above the confluence the Colorado was called the Grand River.  In 1921, Colorado U.S. Representative Edward T. Taylor petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River. On July 25, 1921, the name change was made official in House Joint Resolution 460 of the 66th Congress, over the objections of representatives from Wyoming and Utah and the United States Geological Survey which noted that the drainage basin of the Green River was more extensive than that of the Grand River, although the Grand carried a higher volume of water at its confluence with the Green.",

  "/wiki/North_Platte_River": "The North Platte River  is a major tributary of the Platte River and is approximately 716 miles (1,152\u00a0km) long, counting its many curves. In a straight line, it travels about 550 miles (890\u00a0km), along its course through the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.\n The head of the river is essentially all of Jackson County, Colorado, whose boundaries are the continental divide on the east and south and the mountain drainage peaks on the east\u2014the north boundary is the state of Wyoming border. The rugged Rocky Mountains surrounding Jackson County have at least twelve peaks over 11,000 feet (3,400\u00a0m) in height. From Jackson County the river flows north about 200 miles (320\u00a0km) out of the Routt National Forest and North Park (Colorado basin) near what is now Walden, Colorado, to Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after passing Casper, the river turns to the east-southeast and flows about 350 miles (560\u00a0km) to the city of North Platte, Nebraska.\n The North Platte and South Platte River join to form the Platte River in western Nebraska near the city of North Platte, Nebraska. The Platte River flows to the Missouri River, which joins the Mississippi River to flow to the Gulf of Mexico. The river provides the major avenue of drainage for northern Colorado, eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska.
