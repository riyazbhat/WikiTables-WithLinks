  "/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award": "The National Basketball Association's Coach of the Year is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1962\u201363 NBA season.

The winner is selected at the end of the regular season by a panel of sportswriters from the United States and Canada, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The person with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award. Since its inception, the award has been given to 40 different coaches. The most recent award winner is current Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer. Gregg Popovich, Don Nelson and Pat Riley have each won the award three times, while Hubie Brown, Budenholzer, Mike D'Antoni, Bill Fitch, Cotton Fitzsimmons, and Gene Shue have each won it twice.",

After he retired from coaching, he served as president and front office executive of the Celtics until his death. As a coach, he won 938 games (a record at his retirement) and nine National Basketball Association (NBA) championships in ten seasons (a number surpassed only by Phil Jackson, who won 11 in eighteen seasons). As general manager and team president of the Celtics, he won an additional seven NBA titles, for a grand total of 16 in a span of 29 years, making him one of the most successful team officials in the history of North American professional sports. Auerbach is remembered as a pioneer of modern basketball, redefining basketball as a game dominated by team play and defense and for introducing the fast break as a potent offensive weapon. He groomed many players who went on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Additionally, Auerbach was vital in breaking down color barriers in the NBA. He made history by drafting the first African-American NBA player, Chuck Cooper in 1950, introduced the first African-American starting five in 1964, and hired the first African-American head coach in North American sports (Bill Russell in 1966).",
