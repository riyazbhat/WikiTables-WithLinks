The chassis was a strengthened and slightly longer version of that used in the J-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles. Steering was initially by a Marles Weller and later a Bishop Cam system.  The two-seat car had a wheelbase of 87 inches (2210\u00a0mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067\u00a0mm).  Most cars were open two seaters, but streamlined Airline coup\u00e9 bodies were also made.
