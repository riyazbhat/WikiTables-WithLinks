  "/wiki/Alamo_bolide_impact": "The Alamo bolide impact occurred 367 million years ago, when one or more hypervelocity objects from space slammed into shallow marine waters at a site that is now the Devonian Guilmette Formation of the Worthington Mountains and Schell Creek Range of southeastern Nevada; the event is named for breccias of metamorphosed crushed rock deposits, found as far as the town of Alamo, Nevada (the Alamo Breccia). This catastrophic impact event resulted in what is one of the best-exposed and has become the most accurately dated impact events; it occurred within the Frasnian age of the Devonian at about 367 Ma, a moment in time that was about 3.5 Ma prior to the Frasnian/Famennian extinction events, which it is unlikely to have affected.",

Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the Silver State because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the Battle Born State because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words Battle Born also appear on the state flag); as the Sagebrush State, for the native plant of the same name; and as the Sage-hen State. Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid, much of it within the Great Basin.",
  "/wiki/Bow_City_impact_crater": "The Bow City crater is a potential meteorite impact crater located in southern Alberta, Canada. The 8-kilometre-wide (5.0 mi) crater was discovered in 2012 by Wei Xie of the University of Alberta. The crater is estimated to have formed approximately 70 million years ago. The crater is not directly visible from the surface, as it is buried under approximately a kilometer of overburden. Petrochemical seismic studies provided the first clues to the existence of the crater.",

  "/wiki/Gatun_structure": "The Gatun structure is a possible eroded impact crater. It is named after the nearby Gatun Lake in Panama. It was first discovered in 1972 by geologist Bob Stewart and later studied by Livio L. Tornabene from the University of South Florida Department of Geology. The structure is estimated to have formed about 20 million years ago, during the Miocene epoch. Despite the considerable erosion, it was possible to estimate the original diameter to have been 2.7 to 3 km, assuming the impact hypothesis is correct. Although diagnostic evidence of impact has not been reported, evidence favoring an impact origin include the recovery of possible impact glass at the site. Alternatively, the site may be of volcanic origin.",

It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914.

At approximately 3,720 feet (1,130 m) in elevation, it is the 18th highest in the range. A combination of factors has led geologists to believe the mountain is on the site of an ancient meteorite impact crater. Its proximity to Slide Mountain, the highest Catskill peak, the relatively short distance required to climb the mountain from the south and the excellent views available from the mountain and nearby Giant Ledge have made Panther one of the most popular hikes in the range.

It is listed by the Impact Field Studies Group as a probable impact structure. The structure consists of an area of severe structural deformation and extensive brecciation that was poorly understood and had been thought to be the result of either thrusting over a dome or a cryptoexplosive event. A 12 mi (19 km) circular structure was discovered by geologist Kevin R. Evans through examination of digital elevation data. The structure was originally called the Weaubleau-Osceola structure after Weaubleau Creek and Osceola. It is now known as the Weaubleau structure. Because the site was covered by later Pennsylvanian Period sediments, and only partially exposed to erosion relatively recently, its structure is well preserved, and its age can be determined with fair accuracy.",
