It runs 481 miles (774 km) from the South Florida Metropolitan Area northwest to the Tallahassee Metropolitan Statistical Area. Throughout the state, US 27 has been designated the Claude Pepper Memorial Highway by the Florida Legislature. It was named after long-time Florida statesman Claude Pepper, who served in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The stretch running from Miami to South Bay was originally designated the Thomas E. Will Memorial Highway by the Florida Legislature in 1937 when that portion was known as Florida State Road 26. Will, the founder of Okeelanta, Florida, had worked for almost twenty years to get the state to build a road from Miami to the area south of Lake Okeechobee. For most of its length in the state, US 27 is a divided highway.

  "/wiki/Florida_State_Road_832": "In the mid-1970s, the Florida Department of Transportation (formerly the State Road Department) started a sequence of events that eventually resulted in the transferral of hundred of miles of roadway from State of Florida maintenance to county control.  The first step was the addition of an \"S-\" or \"C-\" prefix onto the original FDOT designation (\"S\" represented \"secondary\"; \"C\" represented \"county\"). State Road signs started disappearing from the \"C\" roads and were replaced by Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) compliant county road signs in the early 1980s; the transition of \"S\" roads to county control took a bit longer. Many roads that were decommissioned in later years skipped the prefix step.\n While the transition occurred throughout the State of Florida, the area most dramatically affected by this process was Florida south of State Road 70 (SR 70) (which runs from Bradenton to Fort Pierce).[citation needed] Several state roads had portions turned over to their respective county jurisdiction and there were cases where entire state roads segments were turned over to the respective county jurisdiction.
