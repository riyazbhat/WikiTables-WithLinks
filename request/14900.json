The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as Shu after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu.

  "/wiki/Cao_Wei": "Wei (220\u2013266), also known as Cao Wei, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). With its capital initially located at Xuchang, and thereafter Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name Wei first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix Cao to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as Wei, such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Northern and Southern dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family dramatically weakened in the aftermath of the deposal and execution of Cao Shuang and his siblings, the former being one of the regents for the third Wei emperor, Cao Fang, with state authority gradually falling into the hands of Sima Yi, another Wei regent, and his family, from 249 onwards. The last Wei emperors would remain largely as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.",

It previously existed from 220\u2013222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan, declared himself emperor. Its name was derived from the place it was based in \u2014 the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as Wu. It was referred to as Dong Wu (Eastern Wu) or Sun Wu by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called Eastern Wu because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and Sun Wu because the family name of its rulers was Sun. During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).",

It was founded by Sima Yan, son of Sima Zhao, who was made the King of Jin and posthumously declared one of the founders of the dynasty, along with Sima Zhao's older brother Sima Shi and father Sima Yi. It followed the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280 AD), which ended with the conquest of Eastern Wu by Jin, culminating in the reunification of China. There are two main divisions in the history of the dynasty. The Western Jin (266\u2013316) was established as a successor state to Cao Wei after Sima Yan usurped the throne and had its capital at Luoyang and later Chang'an (modern Xi'an); Western Jin reunited China in 280 but fairly shortly thereafter fell into a succession crisis, the War of the Eight Princes and suffered from the invasions instigated by the Five Barbarians (Wu Hu). The rebels and invaders began to establish new self-proclaimed states along the Yellow River valley in 304, inaugurating the Sixteen Kingdoms era. These states immediately began fighting each other and the Jin Empire, leading to the second division of the dynasty, the Eastern Jin (317\u2013420), when Sima Rui moved the capital to Jiankang (modern Nanjing). The Eastern Jin dynasty was eventually overthrown by Liu Yu and replaced with the Liu Song in 420.",
