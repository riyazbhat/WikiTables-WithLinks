  "/wiki/Administration_(British_football)": "In the United Kingdom, football clubs sometimes choose to enter administration when they are unable to pay off outstanding debts. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, a business will face a winding-up order bringing them to court and if it is shown that a business cannot pay debts as they fall due or cannot repay outstanding debts then the company will be classified as insolvent. Administration puts accountants \"in charge of pretty much everything apart from coaching the players and picking the team\". For a football club in administration, the \"football creditors rule\" requires football-related debts such as wages owed to players and staff, and transfer fees owed to other clubs to be paid first."
