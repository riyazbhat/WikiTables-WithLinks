  "/wiki/Louisiana_Meridian": "The Louisiana meridian, in longitude 92\u00b0 24\u2032 15\u2033 west of Greenwich, extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the north boundary of Louisiana, and with the baseline through the initial point conforming to the parallel of 31\u00b0 north latitude, governs all the surveys in the state west of the Mississippi River.",
  "/wiki/Louisiana": "Louisiana (/lu\u02cci\u02d0zi\u02c8\u00e6n\u0259/ (listen), /\u02cclu\u02d0zi-/ (listen))[a] is a state in the Deep South region of the South Central United States. It is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States. Louisiana is bordered by the state of Texas to the west, Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River. Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are equivalent to counties. The state's capital is Baton Rouge, and its largest city is New Orleans. Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. [self-published source] These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets.",
  "/wiki/Michigan_Meridian": "The Michigan meridian is the principal meridian (or north-south line) used as a reference in the Michigan Survey, the survey of the U.S. state of Michigan in the early 19th century. It is located at 84 degrees, 21 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude at its northern terminus at Sault Ste. Marie, and varies very little from that line down the length of the state. [citation needed]\n The meridian was surveyed by Benjamin Hough in April 1815. The meridian was selected because it formed one of the principal boundary lines defined in the Treaty of Detroit in 1807, which was the first large cession of land by Native American peoples to the United States in the Michigan Territory. In that treaty, the boundary line was described as running due north from the mouth of the Auglaize River on the Maumee River, which was the site of Fort Defiance (now Defiance, Ohio). Michigan's baseline, which today forms the northern border of Wayne, Washtenaw and other counties, was surveyed at the same time by Alexander Holmes. Although regulations governing the U.S. Public Land Survey System would later specify that the baseline should be a true parallel of latitude, this was not the case in earlier surveys, including the Michigan survey.",
  "/wiki/Michigan": "Michigan (/\u02c8m\u026a\u0283\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ (listen)) is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. Its name originates from the Ojibwe word mishigamaa, meaning \"large water\" or \"large lake\". With a population of just under 10 million, Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area, and is the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River. [b] Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Metro Detroit is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas. The Lower Peninsula is often noted as being shaped like a mitten. The Upper Peninsula (often called \"the U.P.\")",
  "/wiki/Mount_Diablo_Meridian": "The Mount Diablo meridian, established in 1851, is a principal meridian extending north and south from its initial point atop Mount Diablo in California.  Established under the U.S. Public Land Survey System, it is used to describe lands in most of northern California and all of Nevada.  Mount Diablo also marks the baseline at latitude 37\u00b052\u203254\u2033N.",
  "/wiki/Nevada": "Nevada (/n\u026a\u02c8v\u00e6d\u0259/ or /n\u026a\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0d\u0259/) is a state in the Western United States. It is bordered by Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast, and Utah to the east. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 32nd most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the U.S. states. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas\u2013Paradise metropolitan area, including three of the state's four largest incorporated cities. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \"Silver State\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \"Battle Born State\" because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \"Battle Born\" also appear on the state flag); as the \"Sagebrush State\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \"Sage-hen State\". Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid, much of it within the Great Basin.",
  "/wiki/Navajo_Meridian": "The Navajo meridian, established in 1869, is one of the two principal meridians for Arizona, the other being the Gila and Salt River meridian. Its initial point was stated as latitude 35\u00b0 45' north, longitude 108\u00b0 32' 45\" west from Greenwich, but has been revised as 35\u00b044\u203256\u2033N 108\u00b031\u203259\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.74889\u00b0N 108.53306\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.74889; -108.53306 The Navajo meridian and baseline were used to set townships and ranges in a special survey for the original Navajo Reservation, and was set at the eastern boundary of that reservation. The Arizona lands surveyed using the Navajo meridian and baseline were ranges six west to ten west and townships one north to fourteen north, and included Canyon de Chelly National Monument.\n While the above-mentioned Arizona lands still reference the Navajo meridian and baseline, in New Mexico the surveys of lands originally surveyed under it were canceled in 1936, and have since been resurveyed using the New Mexico meridian and baseline. In Arizona, only the portions of the Navajo Reservation that are east of the Hopi Reservation were surveyed using the Navajo meridian and baseline.",
  "/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System": "The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is the surveying method developed and used in the United States to plat, or divide, real property for sale and settling. Also known  as the Rectangular Survey System, it was created by the Land Ordinance of 1785 to survey land ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, following the end of the American Revolution. Beginning with the Seven Ranges, in present-day Ohio, the PLSS has been used as the primary survey method in the United States. Following the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, in 1787, the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory platted lands in the Northwest Territory. The Surveyor General was later merged with the General Land Office, which later became a part of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Today, the BLM controls the survey, sale, and settling of the new lands."
