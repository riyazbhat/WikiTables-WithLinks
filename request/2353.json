  "/wiki/Logan_International_Airport": "General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (IATA: BOS, ICAO: KBOS, FAA LID: BOS), also known as Logan International Airport, and also commonly known as Boston Logan, Logan Airport or simply Logan, is an international airport that is located mostly in East Boston and partially in Winthrop, Massachusetts, United States. It covers 2,384 acres (965\u00a0ha), has six runways and four passenger terminals, and employs an estimated 16,000 people. It is the largest airport in both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the New England region in terms of passenger volume and cargo handling, as well as the 16th-busiest airport in the United States, with 38.4 million total passengers in 2017. The airport saw 42,522,411 passengers in 2019, the most in its history. It is named after General Edward Lawrence Logan, a 19th-century war hero native to Boston.\n Logan has non-stop service to destinations throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Latin America, the Caribbean, the North Atlantic region (including Bermuda and the Azores), Europe, Africa, and Asia. The airport is a hub for Cape Air and Delta Air Lines as well as a focus city for JetBlue.

All of the major U.S. air carriers offer flights from Boston to all or the majority of their primary and secondary hubs.",
  "/wiki/Silver_Line_(MBTA)": "The Silver Line is a system of bus routes in Boston and Chelsea, Massachusetts operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It is operated as part of the MBTA Bus system, but branded as bus rapid transit (BRT) as part of the MBTA subway system. Six routes are operated as part of two disconnected corridors. As of 2019[update], weekday ridership on the Silver Line was 39,000.\n The four Waterfront routes operate out of an underground terminal at South Station and run through the South Boston Piers Transitway - a dedicated bus tunnel through the Seaport District with stations at Courthouse and World Trade Center . At Silver Line Way, they fan out on the surface: the SL1 to Logan International Airport, the SL2 to Design Center, and the SL3 to Chelsea via East Boston. (An additional short turn route, SLW, runs only at peak hours between South Station and Silver Line Way.) The SL1 and SL3 operate in mixed traffic through the Ted Williams Tunnel; the SL3 uses a limited-access haul road in East Boston and a dedicated busway in Chelsea for part of its route. The SL2 operates in mixed traffic in the Seaport. The Waterfront routes use articulated dual-mode buses that operate as electric trolleybuses in the Transitway and conventional diesel buses on the surface. Battery electric buses and a diesel hybrid bus with extended battery range are being tested; one of the types may ultimately replace the dual-mode buses.\n Two routes operate on Washington Street between Dudley Square station (at Nubian Square in Roxbury) and Downtown Boston. The SL5 terminates at Downtown Crossing and the SL4 on the surface at South Station. The two routes operate mostly in dedicated lanes on Washington Street and Essex Street, though sections in Downtown Boston and Nubian Square operate in mixed traffic. They use articulated diesel hybrid buses, which replaced compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered buses in 2016-17.\n The Washington Street corridor was built to replace the Orange Line rapid transit line, which was moved from the Washington Street Elevated to the Southwest Corridor in 1987. Initial plans called for a light rail line operated as part of the Green Line, but trolleybuses and later CNG buses were substituted. Service improvements to the route 49 bus began in 2001, and the Silver Line brand was introduced on July 20, 2002. The articulated CNG buses began operation in 2003. On October 13, 2009, the SL4 began service and the original route was designated SL5.\n Planning began in 1987 for mass transit to serve the growing Seaport; a new transit tunnel called the South Boston Piers Transitway was chosen in 1989. It was to run from Boylston to World Trade Center via Chinatown and South Station, though the Boylston-South Station section was later deferred as a separate phase. After years of delays, service through the $624 million Transitway began on December 17, 2004. SL2 and SL3 service began on December 31, 2004, with the SL1 added on June 1, 2005. The original SL3 route to City Point was discontinued on March 20, 2009. A separate SL3 route to Chelsea - originally planned as part of the cancelled Urban Ring Project - began service on April 21, 2018.\n In 1999, the MBTA designated the Washington Street and Transitway projects as the Silver Line, and planned for the Boylston tunnel extension to include a portal to Washington Street for through-running. The connecting tunnel from Washington Street to Boylston was designated as Phase III and originally . After several design changes, by 2005 Phase III was expected to cost around $800 million; projected completion had been delayed from 2006 to 2010, then to 2013. The project was placed on hold in 2005; planning resumed in 2006 after the controversial portal was relocated. However, the project cost rose to $2.1 billion, and it was cancelled in 2010. Several other Silver Line extensions have been proposed, as has a conversion of the Washington Street corridor to light rail, but most have not been pursued.\n The Silver Line has been the target of criticism by riders and transportation planners. The choice of buses rather than light rail on Washington Street was viewed by Roxbury residents as a deliberate slight, leading to the nickname of \"The Silver Lie.\" Much of the Silver Line is missing BRT Standard features such as enforced dedicated lanes, off-vehicle fare collection, sheltered stations, and transit signal priority; a 2011 report by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) called the Silver Line \"Not BRT\". Because the Transitway was not originally designed for service to Logan Airport or Chelsea, it does not have a direct connection to the Ted Williams Tunnel. A normally-unused ramp would shorten the outbound routing by 0.7 miles (1.1\u00a0km); after years of controversy, MassDOT agreed in 2019 to allow limited use of the ramp.",
  "/wiki/East_Boston": "East Boston, nicknamed Eastie, is a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts with over 40,000 residents. The neighborhood was created by connecting several islands using land fill. It was annexed by Boston in 1836. It is separated from downtown Boston by Boston Harbor and bordered by Winthrop, Revere, Charlestown, and the Chelsea Creek. Southwest of East Boston, across Boston Inner Harbor, is the North End and Boston's Financial District.\n East Boston has long provided a foothold for the latest immigrants with Irish, Russian Jews and later, Italians. John F. Kennedy's great grandfather was one of many Irish people to immigrate to East Boston, and the Kennedy family lived there for some time.\n From the 1990s into the early millennium, Latin American immigrants settled in East Boston, eventually composing more than fifty percent of the population in the 2010 neighborhood census.  In recent years, East Boston has become home to a wave of young professionals seeking residence in Boston in newly renovated condominiums along Jeffries Point and the waterfront, ushering in gentrification.\nOriginally, five islands made up the East Boston neighborhood. To connect to the mainland to the north, fill was mostly used. Logan International Airport is located in East Boston, connecting Boston to domestic and international locations.",

It runs from Bowdoin station in downtown Boston under Boston Harbor to East Boston and Revere on the inner North Shore, where it terminates at Wonderland. The stop at Airport Station, by way of a free shuttle bus, is one of two rapid transit connections to Logan International Airport. In 1967, during a systemwide rebranding, the line was assigned the blue color because it passes under the Boston Harbor. With an end-to-end travel time of less than twenty minutes, the Blue Line is the shortest of Boston's heavy-rail lines and the only line to have both third rail and overhead catenary sections.\n The East Boston Tunnel was built as a streetcar tunnel in 1904 with Howard A. Carson as chief engineer; after an extension to Bowdoin in 1916, it was converted to heavy rail metro rolling stock in 1924. In 1952 and 1954 the line was extended along the former route of the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad, in a project intended to reach Lynn but ultimately cut short to Wonderland. Further extensions to Lynn and Charles/MGH downtown are long-planned but not yet funded. From approximately 1998-2011, the MBTA made most Blue Line stations fully accessible as part of a larger effort to accommodate 6-car trains on the line. As of 2018[update], the only station in service on the Blue Line which is not fully accessible is the downtown Boston terminus Bowdoin.",

  "/wiki/Boston": "Boston (UK: /\u02c8b\u0252st\u0259n/, US: /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0st\u0259n/) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States, and the 21st most populous city in the United States. The city proper covers 49 square miles (127\u00a0km2) with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018, also making it the most populous city in New England. Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.8\u00a0million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. As a combined statistical area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.2\u00a0million people, making it the sixth most populous in the United States.\n Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name. It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston. Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain, it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture. The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20\u00a0million visitors per year. Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), first public or state school (Boston Latin School, 1635) and first subway system (Tremont Street Subway, 1897).\n Today, Boston is a thriving center of scientific research as well as port of entry for commerce and international immigration. The Boston area's many colleges and universities make it a world leader in higher education, including law, medicine, engineering, and business, and the city is considered to be a global pioneer in innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 5,000 startups. Boston's economic base also includes finance, professional and business services, biotechnology, information technology, and government activities. Households in the city claim the highest average rate of philanthropy in the United States; businesses and institutions rank among the top in the country for environmental sustainability and investment. The city has one of the highest costs of living in the United States as it has undergone gentrification, though it remains high on world livability rankings.",
  "/wiki/Lansdowne_station_(MBTA)": "Lansdowne station (formerly Yawkey) is an MBTA Commuter Rail station in Boston, Massachusetts. It serves the Framingham/Worcester Line. It is located next to the Massachusetts Turnpike in the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood near Kenmore Square, below grade between Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue. \n Yawkey station was originally opened as an infill station in 1988, for limited service to Boston Red Sox games at Fenway Park. Regular commuter service began in 2001 for riders headed to Boston University, Kenmore Square, and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area. Inbound and outbound trains formerly shared a single two-car platform on the inbound track, requiring Yawkey passengers to embark or debark from the front two cars of outbound trains or the rear two cars of inbound trains. \n In 2012, work began on a new, fully accessible station, including two longer high-level platforms and an overhead pedestrian bridge which will eventually allow direct access from the Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue overpasses through the planned Fenway Center development. Passengers boarded from the east end of the new station from June 2013 until March 10, 2014; after delays, it opened fully that day. The new station is served by all Worcester Line trains, which was expected to increase ridership from 585 total daily boardings and alightings to 937. By a 2018 count, there were 2,491 daily (1,195 boardings and 1,296 alightings).\n The station was renamed Lansdowne (after nearby Lansdowne Street) effective April 8, 2019, following the May 2018 renaming of Yawkey Way back to Jersey Street.",
  "/wiki/Framingham/Worcester_Line": "The Framingham/Worcester Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system runs west from Boston, Massachusetts to Worcester, Massachusetts through the MetroWest region, serving 17 station stops in Boston, Newton, Wellesley, Natick, Framingham, Ashland, Southborough, Westborough, Grafton, and Worcester. The third-longest and second-busiest line on the system, the Framingham/Worcester Line is plagued by poor track conditions, interference from freight trains, and a number of non-handicapped-accessible stations. Service on the line is a mix of local and express trains serving Worcester plus short-turn Framingham locals.\n The Framingham/Worcester Line was one of the first commuter rail lines, with daily commuter-oriented service to West Newton beginning in 1834. Originally the Boston and Worcester Railroad, service has been operated by the Boston and Albany Railroad, New York Central, Penn Central, and since 1964 by  Boston and Maine Railroad, Amtrak, and the MBCR until 2014 under contract to the MBTA. Since 2014 service has been operated by Keolis North America. In 1975 the line was cut back to Framingham, but service returned to Worcester in 1994 with four infill stations added between 2000 and 2002.\n After purchasing the Framingham-Worcester trackage from CSX in 2012, the MBTA has begun adding service to the outer section of the line and performing track work to increase speeds and reliability. A new station at Boston Landing opened in 2017. The line is the second-busiest on the MBTA Commuter Rail system, with 18,636 daily riders by a 2018 count.\n All stations from Boston Landing east and West Natick west are handicapped accessible; those in between are not.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/Fenway\u2013Kenmore": "Fenway\u2013Kenmore is an officially recognized neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. While it is considered one neighborhood for administrative purposes, it is composed of numerous distinct sections (East Fenway, West Fenway, Audubon Circle, Kenmore Square) that, in casual conversation, are almost always referred to as \"Fenway\", \"the Fenway\", \"Kenmore Square\", or \"Kenmore\". Furthermore, the Fenway neighborhood is divided into two sub-neighborhoods commonly referred to as East Fenway/Symphony and West Fenway.\n Fenway is named after the Fenway, the main thoroughfare, laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted. As of the 2010 Boston Redevelopment Authority Census, Fenway\u2013Kenmore's population was 40,898, while its land area was defined to be 1.24 square miles (3.2\u00a0km2).",
  "/wiki/Kenmore_(MBTA_station)": "Kenmore is a light rail station on the MBTA Green Line, located under Kenmore Square in the Fenway/Kenmore neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The station opened on October 23, 1932 as a one-station extension of the Boylston Street Subway to relieve congestion in the square. Kenmore is the primary station for passengers wishing to visit Fenway Park, located just one block away.",
  "/wiki/Urban_Ring_Project_(MBTA)": "The Urban Ring was a proposed project of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, to develop new public transportation routes that would provide improved circumferential connections among many existing transit lines that project radially from downtown Boston. The Urban Ring Corridor is located roughly one to two miles from downtown Boston, passing through the Massachusetts cities of Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline. The project was expected to convert 41,500 car trips to transit trips daily.\n The Major Investment Study split the project into three phases, the first of which (enhanced bus service) was partially implemented.  The planning of Phase 2 was suspended in January 2010 because MBTA and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have insufficient funding to build a substantial portion of that phase (projected to cost $2.4 billion).  As of 2019[update], some interim bus service improvements have been implemented or are underway, in the absence of major funding."
