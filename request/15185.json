It is the fifth largest airline in the United States when measured by fleet size, scheduled passengers carried, and number of destinations served. Alaska, together with its regional partners, operates a large domestic route network, primarily focused on connecting from the Pacific Northwest and Alaska to over one hundred destinations in the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. The company was founded in 1932 as McGee Airways, offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska. Today, most of the airline's revenue and traffic comes from locations outside of Alaska, but the airline plays a major role in air transportation in the state. It operates many flights linking small towns to major transportation hubs and carries more passengers between Alaska and the contiguous United States than any other airline. The airline operates its largest hub at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport, and it also operates hubs in Anchorage, Los Angeles, Portland, and San Francisco and focus cities at San Diego and San Jose. Alaska Airlines is currently not a member of any of the three major airline alliances, but it plans to join oneworld by early 2021.",
