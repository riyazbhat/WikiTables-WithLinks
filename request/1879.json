Nodes are arranged in a way that indicates how they are related in much the same way as a mind map. In addition to its use for information management it is claimed to be suitable as a task manager, and for use in project management. A Topicscape is created by importing folders (by Drag-and-drop or menus), importing from other mind mapping software including FreeMind, PersonalBrain and MindManager  or by hand with mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts. Import sources may be converted to a new Topicscape or added as a portion of an existing one.

Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984. Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993).",
