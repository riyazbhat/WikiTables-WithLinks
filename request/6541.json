Wind-up Records released it as the album's lead single on September 4, 2006; this release was preceded by the song's Internet leak and its earlier distribution to radio stations on July 31. The track was written by group members Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while Dave Fortman handled its production. Lee revealed that the song was inspired by an unsuccessful relationship with Shaun Morgan, lead singer of the band Seether. The track is an alternative metal, symphonic rock, and electropop piano ballad about a woman terminating a relationship with a love interest who suffers from an addiction. It received a polarized response from music critics; although some praised its radio appeal and the use of numerous musical styles and instruments paired with Lee's laudable vocal performance, others felt that it was not a worthy comeback song and found it inferior to previous songs by the band. Call Me When You're Sober was commercially successful in the US, where it peaked at number ten on the main Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Alternative Songs chart in addition to entering the top ten of several Billboard component charts. It was a success elsewhere as well, peaking within the top ten on various charts internationally, including the UK, Australia, Finland and New Zealand. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Marc Webb and filmed in Hollywood; it draws inspiration from the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. It features British actor Oliver Goodwill as the Big Bad Wolf, trying to seduce Lee. The video was noted to contain metaphorical undertones as opposed to the song's literal lyrics.",

As a result, none of the band's three studio albums feature the same lineup. The latter two changes led to a hiatus, with temporary band members contributing to tour performances.

However, Duran Duran would soon shed this image by using fashion and marketing to build a more refined and elegant presentation. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The video age catapulted Duran Duran into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. Many of their videos were shot on 35 mm film, which gave a much more polished look than was standard at the time. They also collaborated with professional film directors to take the quality a step further, often teaming up with Australian director Russell Mulcahy for some of their most memorable video offerings.

A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nirvana's sudden success popularized alternative rock, and Cobain found himself described as the spokesman of a generation and Nirvana the flagship band of Generation X.

  "/wiki/Alice_in_Chains": "Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Starr was replaced by Mike Inez in 1993. William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who died in 2002. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains. Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos, and 32 singles. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and William DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band. Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 30 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone, with two No. 1 albums and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart. The band has had 18 Top 10 songs on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No."
