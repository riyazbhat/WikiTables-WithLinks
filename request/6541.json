  "/wiki/Call_Me_When_You're_Sober": "\"Call Me When You're Sober\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence recorded for their second studio album The Open Door. Wind-up Records released it as the album's lead single on September 4, 2006; this release was preceded by the song's Internet leak and its earlier distribution to radio stations on July 31. The track was written by group members Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while Dave Fortman handled its production. Lee revealed that the song was inspired by an unsuccessful relationship with Shaun Morgan, lead singer of the band Seether. The track is an alternative metal, symphonic rock, and electropop piano ballad about a woman terminating a relationship with a love interest who suffers from an addiction.\n It received a polarized response from music critics; although some praised its radio appeal and the use of numerous musical styles and instruments paired with Lee's laudable vocal performance, others felt that it was not a worthy comeback song and found it inferior to previous songs by the band. \"Call Me When You're Sober\" was commercially successful in the US, where it peaked at number ten on the main Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Alternative Songs chart in addition to entering the top ten of several Billboard component charts. It was a success elsewhere as well, peaking within the top ten on various charts internationally, including the UK, Australia, Finland and New Zealand. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\n An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Marc Webb and filmed in Hollywood; it draws inspiration from the fairy tale \"Little Red Riding Hood\". It features British actor Oliver Goodwill as the Big Bad Wolf, trying to seduce Lee. The video was noted to contain metaphorical undertones as opposed to the song's literal lyrics. \"Call Me When You're Sober\" was part of the set lists during three of Evanescence's worldwide tours; The Open Door Tour (2006\u201307), the Evanescence Tour (2011\u201312) and the band's fourth worldwide tour (2016\u201317).

After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies.\n The lineup of the group changed several times over the course of the first two studio albums' productions and promotions: David Hodges left in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), bassist Will Boyd in 2006, followed by guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray in 2007, and Terry Balsamo in 2015. As a result, none of the band's three studio albums feature the same lineup. The latter two changes led to a hiatus, with temporary band members contributing to tour performances.\n The band reconvened in June 2009 with a new lineup; their next studio album, Evanescence, was released in 2011. It debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart with 127,000 copies in sales. The album also debuted at number one on four other different Billboard charts; the Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and the Hard Rock Albums charts. The band spent 2012 on tour in promotion of their latest album with other bands including The Pretty Reckless and Fair to Midland. Troy McLawhorn also became a full-time band member during this time. Following the end of the album's tour cycle in 2012, the band entered another hiatus.\n In 2015, Evanescence emerged from hiatus and announced they would resume touring; however, they denied that new Evanescence material was being produced, as Lee was focusing on a solo project instead. In addition, Balsamo left the band and was replaced by Jen Majura. Late 2016 saw additional touring from the band and a statement from Lee that Evanescence would continue. In March 2017, Lee stated Evanescence was working on a fourth album for release later in 2017.

Written and composed by Geoff Gill and Cliff Wade, the song had first been recorded by English singer Jenny Darren on her 1978 album Queen of Fools and Benatar made adjustments in the original lyrics as such references as \"A to Zed\" and \"moonraker\" which would have likely confused American listeners. \"Heartbreaker\" proved to be Benatar's breakthrough single, reaching #23 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #19 on the Cash Box Top 100.  In Canada, the song peaked at number 16.\n Although \"Heartbreaker\" is only Benatar's tenth highest-charting US single, it spent four and a half months on the U.S. charts, with only three of her singles surpassing that amount of time. \n The song is featured as downloadable content for the music video game series Rock Band, and is a playable song for the game Guitar Hero World Tour.

The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom (1995) benefited from the resurgence of third-wave ska in the 1990s, and \"Don't Speak\", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. \"Just a Girl\", co-written by Stefani, was described as \"the most popular cut on the CD\".\n The group's next album, Return of Saturn (2000), despite its Top 40 hit single \"Simple Kind of Life\", did not match the success of their previous album, but received critical praise and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards.

The band were one of the most successful acts of the 1980s, but by the end of the decade, membership and music style changes challenged the band before a resurgence in the early 1990s. The group were a leading band in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US in the 1980s. They achieved 14 singles in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the US Billboard Hot 100, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide.\n When the band emerged they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet and Visage. However, Duran Duran would soon shed this image by using fashion and marketing to build a more refined and elegant presentation. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n The video age catapulted Duran Duran into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. Many of their videos were shot on 35\u00a0mm film, which gave a much more polished look than was standard at the time. They also collaborated with professional film directors to take the quality a step further, often teaming up with Australian director Russell Mulcahy for some of their most memorable video offerings. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows.\n The group were formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon.

Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.\n In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nirvana's sudden success popularized alternative rock, and Cobain found himself described as the \"spokesman of a generation\" and Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of Generation X.\n Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, Nirvana released their third studio album, In Utero (1993), to critical acclaim and further chart success. Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than Nevermind, it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994. Various posthumous releases have been  overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996.\n During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana was awarded an American Music Award, Brit Award, Grammy Award, seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards.
