The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River, and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35). Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth and across the Canada\u2013U.S. border, near Grand Portage. Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (US 90). The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; the Mississippi Delta, and New Orleans.\nThe route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system. Many southerners traveled north along US\u00a061 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul.",

  "/wiki/Dammon_Round_Barn": "Dammon Round Barn is a round barn just southeast of Red Wing, Minnesota, United States, adjacent to U.S. Route 61.

It was built in 1914, with a foundation of Mississippi River limestone, and is 60 feet (18\u00a0m) in diameter and 60 feet (18\u00a0m) high. It was built during a time of agricultural growth in Goodhue County, when dairy cow herds were averaging 25 cows per farm and farmers were starting to build specialized barns.  The round barn design was built around a silo and provided insulation for the silage, as well as making feeding and cleaning easier.  Despite the efficiency, however, round barns were difficult to construct, and they were not widely adopted.  Later in its history the barn was used for honey production of the bee keeping owners of the farm.  In 2000 the Farm was purchased by Robin and Elaine Kleffman and the Dammon Barn underwent some significant restoration.  A straightening of the walls and replacement of the original pillars for the upper floor support and a leveling and new installation of a floor in the top level of the barn makes this one of the most premiere remaining round barns in Minnesota.[citation needed]",

Round barn construction in the United States can be divided into two overlapping eras. The first, the octagonal era, spanned from 1850\u20131900. The second, the true circular era, spanned from 1889\u20131936. The overlap meant that round barns of both types, polygonal and circular, were built during the latter part of the nineteenth century.
