  "/wiki/Taoism": "Daoism (/\u02c8da\u028a\u026az\u0259m/, /\u02c8da\u028a-/), or Taoism (/\u02c8ta\u028a-/), is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasises living in harmony with the Dao (Chinese: \u9053; pinyin: D\u00e0o; literally: 'the Way', also romanized as Tao). The Dao is a fundamental idea in most  Chinese philosophical schools; in Daoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Daoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order, but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving perfection  by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called the way or dao. Daoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasise wu wei (action without intention), naturalness, simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: \u6148 compassion, \u5109 frugality, and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 humility. The roots of Daoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Daoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the I Ching (Yi Jing), which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The Legalist Shen Buhai (c. 400 \u2013 c. 337 BCE) may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei. The Dao De Jing, a compact book containing teachings attributed to  Laozi (\u8001\u5b50; L\u01ceoz\u01d0; Lao\u00b3 Tz\u016d\u00b3), is widely considered the keystone work of the Daoist tradition, together with the later writings of Zhuangzi.",
  "/wiki/Religion_in_China": "The government of China officially espouses state atheism, though Chinese civilization has historically long been a cradle and host to a variety of the most enduring religio-philosophical traditions of the world. Confucianism and Taoism (Daoism), later joined by Buddhism, constitute the three teachings that have shaped Chinese culture. There are no clear boundaries between these intertwined religious systems, which do not claim to be exclusive, and elements of each enrich popular or folk religion. The emperors of China claimed the Mandate of Heaven and participated in Chinese religious practices. In the early 20th century, reform-minded officials and intellectuals attacked all religions as superstitious, and since 1949, China has been governed by the Communist Party of China, an atheist institution that prohibits party members from practicing religion while in office. In the culmination of a series of atheistic and anti-religious campaigns already underway since the late 19th century, the Cultural Revolution against old habits, ideas, customs and culture, lasting from 1966 to 1976, destroyed or forced them underground. :138 Under following leaders, religious organisations were given more autonomy. The government formally recognizes five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam (though the Chinese Catholic Church is independent of the Catholic Church in Rome).",

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire.

Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion, its practitioners often regard it as Japan's indigenous religion. Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists, although adherents rarely use that term themselves. Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami (gods or spirits), supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things. The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic. The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines, family shrines, and public shrines. The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion's adherents. Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances, age specific celebrations, and seasonal festivals.",
  "/wiki/Religion_in_Japan": "Religion in Japan is dominated by Shinto (the ethnic religion of the Japanese people) and by Buddhism.

[note 2]\n Most of the Japanese (50% to 80% considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d) pray and worship ancestors and gods (\u795e, kami, shin or, archaically, jin) at Shinto shrines or at private altars, while not identifying as Shinto or Shintoist in surveys. This is because these terms have little meaning for the majority of the Japanese, or because they define membership in Shinto organizations or sects. The term religion (\u5b97\u6559, sh\u016bky\u014d) itself in Japanese culture defines only organized religions (that is, religions with specific doctrines and required membership). People who identify as non-religious (\u7121\u5b97\u6559, mush\u016bky\u014d) in surveys actually mean that they do not belong to any religious organization, even though they may take part in Shinto rituals and worship. Jesse LeFebvre has explored the manner in which non-religiousness is deployed as an identity by Japanese in articulating their religious outlook. Some scholars, such as Jun'ichi Isomae and Jason \u0100nanda Josephson, have challenged the usefulness of the term religion in regard to Japanese traditions, arguing that the Japanese term and concept of religion (sh\u016bky\u014d) is an invention of the 19th century.",

The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment. Falun Gong originated and was first taught publicly in northeastern China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi. It emerged toward the end of China's qigong boom\u2014a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing. It differs from other qigong schools in its absence of fees or formal membership, lack of daily rituals of worship, its greater emphasis on morality, and the theological nature of its teachings. Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline, a spiritual movement, a cultivation system in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, or as a form of Chinese religion. The practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese officialdom, but by the mid to late 1990s, the Communist Party and public security organizations increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size, independence from the state, and spiritual teachings.",

As of the early 21st century, there are about 25 million Sikhs. Sikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru (1469\u20131539), and the nine Sikh gurus that succeeded him. The tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, terminating the line of human Gurus and making the scripture the eternal, religious spiritual guide for Sikhs.

Confucius considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang (c. 1600\u20131046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (c.\u20091046\u2013256 BCE) for the Warring States period. Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE), but survived. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist Huang\u2013Lao as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism. A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism.

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863, it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents, known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, spread throughout most of the world's countries and territories. It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion, whose founder (the B\u00e1b) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h (1817\u20131892) announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine. Following Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (1844\u20131921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897\u20131957). Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community, which sits in Haifa, Israel, near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b.",

  "/wiki/Tenriism": "Tenrikyo (\u5929\u7406\u6559, Tenriky\u014d, sometimes rendered as Tenriism) is a Japanese new religion which is neither strictly monotheistic nor pantheistic, originating from the teachings of a 19th-century woman named Nakayama Miki, known to her followers as Oyasama. Followers of Tenrikyo believe that God of Origin, God in Truth, known by several names including Tsukihi, Tenri-\u014c-no-Mikoto and Oyagamisama (God the Parent) revealed divine intent through Miki Nakayama as the Shrine of God and to a lesser extent the roles of the Honseki Izo Iburi and other leaders. Tenrikyo's worldly aim is to teach and promote the Joyous Life, which is cultivated through acts of charity and mindfulness called hinokishin.\n The primary operations of Tenrikyo today are located at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters (Tenri, Nara, Japan), which supports 16,833 locally managed churches in Japan, the construction and maintenance of the oyasato-yakata and various community-focused organisations. It has 1.75 million followers in Japan and is estimated to have over 2 million worldwide.",
  "/wiki/Jainism": "Jainism (/\u02c8d\u0292e\u026an\u026az\u0259m/), traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called Jains, a word derived from the Sanskrit word jina (victor) referring to the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths by destroying karma through an ethical and spiritual life. Jainism is a transtheistic religion, and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as tirthankaras, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third Tirthankara Parshvanatha in 900 BCE, and the twenty-fourth Tirthankara the Mah\u0101v\u012bra around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology. Their religious texts are called Agamas. The main religious premises of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), anek\u0101ntav\u0101da (many-sidedness), aparigraha (non-attachment) and asceticism. Devout Jains take five main vows: ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing), brahmacharya (celibacy or chastity or sexual continence), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles.",

Cheondoism has its origins in the peasant rebellions which arose starting in 1812 during the Joseon dynasty.\n Cheondoism incorporates elements of Korean shamanism.

Adherents consider S\u1ed5 to be a prophet, and H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o a continuation of a 19th-century Buddhist ministry known as B\u1eedu S\u01a1n K\u1ef3 H\u01b0\u01a1ng (Sino-Vietnamese \u5bf6\u5c71\u5947\u9999). The founders of these traditions are regarded by H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o followers as living Buddhas\u2014destined to save mankind from suffering and to protect the Vietnamese nation. H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o claims approximately two million followers throughout Vietnam; in some provinces near its Delta birthplace, as many as 90 percent of the population practice this tradition. An important characteristic of this movement is its emphasis on peasant farmers, exemplified by the old slogan, Practicing Buddhism While Farming Your Land. H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o stresses the practice of Buddhism by lay people in the home, rather than focusing primarily on temple worship and ordination. Aid to the poor is favored over pagoda-building or expensive rituals; religious and social ceremonies are ideally simple and modest, and are not to include the food offerings, divination services, and elaborate wedding and funeral customs found in some manifestations of Southeast Asian life. These are viewed as a waste of money which would be better spent helping the needy.",
