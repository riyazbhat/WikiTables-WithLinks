  "/wiki/Cheras": "The Chera dynasty (or C\u0113ra) was one of the principal lineages in the early history of the present day states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in southern India. Together with the Cholas of Uraiyur and the Pandyas of Madurai, the early Cheras were known as one of the three major powers (muventar) of ancient Tamilakam (a macro region in south India) in the early centuries of the Common Era. The people of the Chera country owed their importance to exchange of spices, especially black pepper, with Middle Eastern and Graeco-Roman merchants. The age and antiquity of the dynasty is difficult to establish. The Cheras of the early historical period (c. second century BCE - c. third century CE) are known to have had their original centre at Karur/Karuvur-Vanchi in interior Tamil Nadu and harbours at Muchiri (Muziris) and Thondi (Tyndis) on the Indian Ocean coast (Kerala). The early historic (pre-Pallava) Chera chiefdom is often described as a redistributive economy based on kinship. It was largely shaped by agriculture, of both crops and livestock, and predatory politics. Inscriptions discovered from Karur dated to c. 1st - 2nd century CE, describe Ilam Kadungo, son of Perum Kadungo, and the grandson of Ko Athan Cheral of the Irumporai clan.",
