The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route\u00a011 (US\u00a011) in the town of Chenango (just north of Binghamton) in the Southern Tier. The northern terminus is at NY\u00a037 near the village of Morristown in the North Country. In between, the route serves three cities of varying size: Norwich, Utica, and Watertown. The distance between Utica and Binghamton is a major trucking route, and features many gas stations, truck stops, and fast food restaurants. Between Boonville and Lowville, it follows the Black River Valley and between Watertown and Morristown, it follows the St. Lawrence River valley.\n It is a two lane, undivided, full access roadway for the majority of its length, except between the village of New Hartford and Alder Creek, where it is a four-lane highway. Within that span, it is a limited access highway in the city of Utica, referred locally as The Arterial and the North\u2013South Arterial. \n NY\u00a012 intersects several primary east\u2013west routes, including US\u00a020, NY\u00a05, and NY\u00a03. From Barneveld to the town of Remsen (a distance of 11 miles or 18 kilometres), NY\u00a012 overlaps NY\u00a028. NY\u00a012 also intersects US\u00a011 twice: once at its beginning in Binghamton and once in Watertown.

NY\u00a012 also connects with Interstate\u00a081 (I-81) near both its beginning and end points in the same manner.\n NY\u00a012, as originally assigned in 1924, extended from Chenango in the south to Clayton in the north. It was extended east over the former routing of NY\u00a03 to Alexandria Bay in 1930, then along a new roadway to Morristown in the 1960s. Parts of NY\u00a012 have been rerouted onto new roadways in areas, primarily in Oneida County.",

Along the way, it passes through many communities, including the cities of Norwich and Oneonta. Outside of the communities, the route serves largely rural areas of the state and traverses the Catskill Mountains in the state's Central New York Region. NY\u00a023 crosses the Hudson River at Catskill via the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.\n Sections of what is now NY\u00a023 were part of unsigned legislative routes as early as 1908; however, NY\u00a023 itself was not assigned until 1924. At the time, the route extended from Oneonta to Massachusetts and followed a slightly different alignment from Cairo to Claverack via Hudson that took the route along modern County Route\u00a023B (CR\u00a023B) in eastern Greene County. NY\u00a023 was extended west to Norwich in the mid-1920s and to NY\u00a026 in northwestern Chenango County in 1930.

It was 5.47 miles (8.80\u00a0km) long and connected the hamlet of Preston to the nearby city of Norwich. The route began in the hamlet at an intersection with three county-maintained highways and proceeded eastward through the town of Preston to downtown Norwich, where it terminated at an intersection with NY\u00a012.\n What became NY\u00a0319 was originally built during the early 19th century as the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, one of many privately maintained turnpikes in the state of New York. The state of New York assumed ownership of the turnpike's routing in the early 20th century, and the Preston\u2013Norwich state highway was designated as NY\u00a0319 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Maintenance of NY\u00a0319 was split between the state and the city of Norwich, with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) handling the part of the route west of the city limits.\n In 1962, the New York State Legislature approved a highway maintenance swap that would transfer the state-maintained section of NY\u00a0319 to Chenango County when a new alignment was constructed for NY\u00a023 through the northwestern part of the county. The project was completed in July 1984, at which time the NY\u00a0319 designation was completely removed and Chenango County assumed maintenance of the route's former alignment west of Norwich.
