  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television, drama is a genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone. Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre, such as police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical period drama, domestic drama, teen drama or comedy-drama. These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods. All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent (mimesis) characters. In this broader sense, drama is a mode distinct from novels, short stories, and narrative poetry or songs. In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television, drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy. It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted. Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.",

  "/wiki/Inuit": "Inuit (/\u02c8\u026anju\u026at/; syllabics: \u1403\u14c4\u1403\u1466, the people, singular: Inuk \u1403\u14c4\u1483, dual: Inuuk \u1403\u14c5\u1483[failed verification]) are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska (United States). The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate used in Nunavut. Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec, Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador, and in various parts of the Northwest Territories, particularly around the Arctic Ocean, in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. [note 1] With the exception of NunatuKavut these areas are known in the Inuit languages as Inuit Nunangat. In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis. The Greenlandic Inuit are descendants of ancient indigenous migrations from Canada, as these people migrated to the east through the continent. Inuit of Denmark are Danish citizens, although not the citizens of the European Union. In the United States, the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat, live primarily on the Alaska North Slope and on Little Diomede Island. In Canada and the United States, the term Eskimo was commonly used to describe Inuit, and Siberia and Alaska's Yupik, I\u00f1upiat, and Chukchi people. However, Inuit is not accepted as a term for the Yupik and Chukchi, and Eskimo is the only term that applies to Yupik, Chukchi, I\u00f1upiat and Inuit. Since the late 20th century, Indigenous peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit consider Eskimo to be a pejorative term, and they more frequently identify as Inuit for an autonym.",
  "/wiki/Drama": "Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or television. Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC) - the earliest work of dramatic theory. The term drama comes from a Greek word meaning action (Classical Greek: \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1, drama), which is derived from I do (Classical Greek: \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word play or game (translating the Anglo-Saxon ple\u0121an or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare's time - just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre. The use of drama in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy - for example, Zola's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887). It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe drama as a genre within their respective media. The term radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance. May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio. The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.",

Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre -, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. Comedy, compared with other film genres, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog).",

  "/wiki/Documentary_short": "A documentary film is a non-fictional, motion picture intended to document reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record. Documentary has been described as a filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries. Documentary films were originally called actuality films, and were one minute, or less, in length. Over time, documentaries have evolved to be longer in length, and to include more categories; some examples being: educational, observational, and docufiction. Documentaries are meant to be informative works, and are often used within schools, as a resource to teach various principles. Social media platforms, such as YouTube, have provided an avenue for the growth of the documentary film genre; These platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility; thereby, enhancing the ability to educate a larger volume of viewers, and broadening the reach of persons who receive that information."
