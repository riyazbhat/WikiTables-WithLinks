The centre provides 170,000 square metres (1,800,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of floor space across two merged buildings - 33 Canada Square (known as \"CGC1\") and 25 Canada Square (known as \"CGC2\"), and houses the bulk of Citi's UK employee base. Together, both buildings form the Citigroup Centre complex.\n 25 Canada Square, or Citigroup Centre 2, stands at 200 metres (656\u00a0ft) and, alongside HSBC Tower (with which it was built in tandem), is the joint 4th-tallest building in the United Kingdom (behind The Shard, One Canada Square and Heron Tower). Designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli & Associates, construction of the 45-storey tower - undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors - began in 1998 and was completed in 2001, with Citigroup leasing the building from the outset. The building was bought by RBS in 2004 along with 5 Canada Square (leased to Bank of America) for $1.12 billion. Subsequently, on 2 July 2007, CGC2 was individually sold to a joint venture between Quinlan Private and PropInvest for \u00a31 billion (US$2 billion). Citigroup pay \u00a346.5 million a year in rent for the tower, generating a yield of 4.6% to the owners. The east facing side of 25 Canada Square up to level 40 is configured for use by tenants. This building was bought back by Citi in 2019.\n 33 Canada Square, or Citigroup Centre 1, is the smaller of the two buildings in the complex, designed by Norman Foster and completed in 1999, two years before its neighbour. At 105 metres (344\u00a0ft) tall, the building is made up of eighteen floors, all of which are adjoined to their equivalent floors in 25 Canada Square. The building is owned by Citigroup, and was built before the completion of the Jubilee line extension in late 1999.\n In addition to main entrances from both Canada Square and Upper Bank Street, Citigroup Centre is also accessible via underground walkways from Canada Place shopping mall and Canary Wharf London Underground station - served by the Jubilee line. The Centre is also close to DLR stations Canary Wharf and Heron Quays, which provide connections with the City, London City Airport and surrounding areas.",

The county town is the city of Winchester. Its two largest cities, Southampton and Portsmouth, are administered separately as unitary authorities; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council.\n First settled about 14,000 years ago, Hampshire's history dates to Roman Britain, when its chief town was Winchester. When the Romans left Britain, the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe, principally in the river valleys. The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book, divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century, the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. By the 16th century, the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester. By the mid-19th century, with the county's population at 219,210 (double that at the beginning of the century) in more than 86,000 dwellings, agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest. Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars. The Isle of Wight, historically part of Hampshire, became a separate ceremonial county in 1974.\n The county's geography is varied, with upland to 286 metres (938\u00a0ft) and mostly south-flowing rivers. There are areas of downland and marsh, and two national parks: the New Forest, and part of the South Downs, which together cover 45 per cent of Hampshire.\n Hampshire is one of the most affluent counties in the country, with an unemployment rate lower than the national average, and its economy derived from major companies, maritime, agriculture and tourism.

(Kirk o'Shotts means 'Church of Shotts' and takes its name from nearby Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church and Kirk O' Shotts' Primary School both located as you enter the nearby village of Salsburgh.)\n The BBC 405-line television service in Scotland started from Kirk o'Shotts on 14 March 1952 using low power reserve transmitters (Marconi). Full service began on 17 August 1952 using the main high power transmitters (Vision EMI Type 5704, Sound STC Type CTS-12).  The station provided a service to a potential 4.1 million viewers and operated on Channel 3 (Vision 56.75\u00a0MHz, Sound 53.25\u00a0MHz) and transmissions were vertically polarised.\n It subsequently became the main national FM transmitting station for the area, although that role is now filled by the nearby site at Black Hill.\n Three DAB multiplexes are broadcast from the site: BBC (12B), Digital One (12A) and Switch Scotland (11D).\n It has a 183 metres (600\u00a0ft) tall guyed mast, built in 1952. The mast was originally 228.6 metres (750\u00a0ft) tall.\n The station is owned by Arqiva.",

  "/wiki/RNAS_Inskip_(HMS_Nightjar)": "RNAS Inskip, or as it was otherwise known HMS Nightjar, is a former Fleet Air Arm airfield near the village of Inskip, Lancashire, England at 53\u00b049\u203239\u2033N 2\u00b049\u203246\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff53.827433\u00b0N 2.829537\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.827433; -2.829537\ufeff (RNAS Inskip). It is now used as a military high frequency radio transmitting station.\n In the 1980s there were Marconi 50\u00a0kW transmitters operating in the (Very Low Frequency (VLF) band, transmitting Morse code to ships close to the United Kingdom.[citation needed]\n For long distance work, the shortwave bands were used, again transmitting Morse to ships mostly based on Marconi transmitters, typically 10\u00a0kW or less. The same information would be transmitted on different frequencies and it was the ship's responsibility to find the correct frequency to monitor. This was because of the different propagation characteristics of the various frequencies used.\n The site has also been used to store natural, purified uranium ore (known as yellowcake) as part of the UK's reserve of such material.[citation needed]",

The administrative centre is Preston. The county has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of 1,189 square miles (3,080\u00a0km2). People from Lancashire are known as Lancastrians.\n The history of Lancashire begins with its founding in the 12th century. In the Domesday Book of 1086, some of its lands were treated as part of Yorkshire.  The land that lay between the Ribble and Mersey, Inter Ripam et Mersam, was included in the returns for Cheshire.  When its boundaries were established, it bordered Cumberland, Westmorland, Yorkshire, and Cheshire.\n Lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the Industrial Revolution. Liverpool and Manchester grew into its largest cities, with economies built around the docks and the cotton mills respectively. These cities dominated global trade and the birth of modern industrial capitalism.  The county contained several mill towns and the collieries of the Lancashire Coalfield.  By the 1830s, approximately 85% of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in Lancashire. Accrington, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Bury, Chorley, Colne, Darwen, Manchester, Nelson, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale and Wigan were major cotton mill towns during this time. Blackpool was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of Lancashire's mill towns, particularly during wakes week.\n The historic county was subject to a significant boundary reform in 1974 which created the current ceremonial county and removed Liverpool and Manchester, and most of their surrounding conurbations to form the metropolitan and ceremonial counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The detached northern part of Lancashire in the Lake District, including the Furness Peninsula and Cartmel, was merged with Cumberland and Westmorland to form Cumbria. Lancashire lost 709 square miles of land to other counties, about two fifths of its original area, although it did gain some land from the West Riding of Yorkshire.\n Today the ceremonial county borders Cumbria to the north, Greater Manchester and Merseyside to the south, and North and West Yorkshire to the east; with a coastline on the Irish Sea to the west.  The county palatine boundaries remain the same as those of the pre-1974 county with Lancaster serving as the county town, and the Duke of Lancaster (i.e. the Queen) exercising sovereignty rights, including the appointment of lords lieutenant in Greater Manchester and Merseyside.",

  "/wiki/Stirling": "Stirling (/\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0rl\u026a\u014b/; Scots: Stirlin; Scottish Gaelic: Sruighlea [\u02c8s\u032at\u032a\u027eu\u029dl\u0259]) is a city in central Scotland, 26 miles (42\u00a0km) north-east of Glasgow and 37 miles (60\u00a0km) north-west of the Scottish capital, Edinburgh. The market town, surrounded by rich farmland, grew up connecting the royal citadel, the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen, the bridge and the port. Located on the River Forth, Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area, and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire. Proverbially it is the strategically important \"Gateway to the Highlands\".\n It has been said that \"Stirling, like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together\". Similarly \"he who holds Stirling, holds Scotland\" is often quoted.\nStirling's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south.\n When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway, according to a 9th-century legend, it was attacked by Danish invaders. The sound of a wolf roused a sentry, however, who alerted his garrison, which forced a Viking retreat. This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug. The area is today known as Wolfcraig.\n Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto: \"Steadfast as the Rock\".\n Once the capital of Scotland, Stirling is visually dominated by Stirling Castle. Stirling also has a medieval parish church, the Church of the Holy Rude, where, on 29 July 1567, the infant James VI was anointed King of Scots by the Bishop of Orkney with the service concluding after a sermon by John Knox. The poet King was educated by George Buchanan and grew up in Stirling. He was later also crowned King of England and Ireland on 25 July 1603, bringing closer the countries of the United Kingdom.\n Modern Stirling is a centre for local government, higher education, tourism, retail, and industry. The mid-2012 census estimate for the population of the city is 36,440; the wider Stirling council area has a population of about 93,750.\n One of the principal royal strongholds of the Kingdom of Scotland, Stirling was created a royal burgh by King David I in 1130. In 2002, as part of Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, Stirling was granted city status.",
