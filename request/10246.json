  "/wiki/Spring_Ridge_Baptist_Church": "Spring Ridge Baptist Church is a historic Baptist church in rural Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, between the small hamlets of Enterprise and Aimwell.

The church was organized in 1873. The present church building is believed to have been built in 1892. It had not been used regularly as a church for about 40 years when it was added to the National Register, but it was used occasionally for homecoming services. It was deemed significant as a rare surviving example of an important North Louisiana building type....a well-preserved example of an austere country frame church. As such, it represents a local North Louisiana unpretentious building tradition associated with the Upland South settlement patterns of the region. From an architectural standpoint, churches of this type should be regarded as remote descendants of provincial Greek Revival temple form churches. Generally associated with the Methodist and Baptist sects, they represent an archetype which is a vital part of the Upland South building tradition.",

  "/wiki/Bayou_Rouge_Baptist_Church": "Bayou Rouge Baptist Church is a historic church located at the corner of Church Street and Barron Lane in Evergreen, Louisiana. Built in 1859, the frame, 5 bay basilican plan church with a semihexagonal chancel is a classic example of a Greek Revival country church, which could be found in rural parishes from the 1870s to the Civil War. Although these churches are common in the eastern United States, there are few examples still standing in Louisiana. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The information on the Historical Registry is inaccurate. The current church was built in 1859. It is not the site of the original church established in 1841 at a different location which is in a field off of Stubblefield Road. The graves remain at the original location where it is overgrown. Very few headstones are visible. While courthouse records from 1838 show that the land was sold for a preaching house or house of worship, the land surrounding the original site has changed hands over the years. While there is a right-of-way that was established, the current owner (as of April 2019) was unaware when presented with this information. The church, at present (date being February 2020), is scheduled for a major renovation.",

  "/wiki/Holden,_Louisiana": "Holden is an unincorporated community located on U.S. Highway 190 between Albany and Livingston in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, United States. Holden is in a section of land awarded to Micajah Spillars by a Spanish land grant. LA Hwy 441 which runs through Holden in a northwest-southeast direction is the road that connected Springfield with Baton Rouge to the west and points in Mississippi to the east. In 1907, the east-west line of the Baton Rouge, Hammond & Eastern Railroad was constructed. When the railroad purchased land through the area that would later become Holden, one of the people selling rights-of-way was an early settler named James Mahlon Holden. Another person who contributed to the economic growth of the area was James Jim F. McCarroll, who had the town surveyed into lots. Owner of the McCarroll Lumber Co., he established a sawmill about 1909 and contracted with the railroad for a spur track to his mill south of the railroad on the east bank of the Tickfaw River. Sinclair Cooper constructed the spur, and the spur and the community became known as Cooper's Spur. Some residents were not happy with the name because Cooper was not a native of the area. When the Coopers later moved away the locals asked for the name to be changed to Holden to honor James Mahlon Holden. On October 17, 1916, representatives of the railroad and Holden citizens, McCarroll, Drumwright, and Sharp met with the Louisiana Railroad Commission to plan a Holden depot. The Holden post office was established on December 8, 1909, with Bunyan Drumwright as postmaster.",

In the late 1800s, the church bought land on Texas Avenue and began construction of a new church. As the church was being built, a storm destroyed the entire structure. The leaders of the First Colored Baptist Church decided to rebuild the structure at a cost of $3,198.45. This new church, designed by Nathaniel Sykes Allen, was dedicated at 1057 Texas Avenue in 1903. Soon after its dedication, the church was renamed Union Missionary Baptist Church.
