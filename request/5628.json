In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \nk\ng\nm\n2\ns\n\u2212\n3\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis.

  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols. [note 1] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position; alternatively, a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector. A common choice of coordinates is latitude, longitude and elevation. To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection.",
  "/wiki/Annapolis_Royal_Generating_Station": "The Annapolis Royal Generating Station is a tidal power generating station in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is the only tidal generating station in North America and one of the few in the world. It is located upstream of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia in the Bay of Fundy. It generates about 30 million kilowatt hours per year, enough for 4500 houses. Peak output is 20 megawatts. A causeway on the Annapolis River creates a reservoir which powers a water turbine. Sluice gates in the causeway allow the reservoir to be refilled by the incoming tide, and retain the water in the reservoir when the tide recedes. Power is only generated when the tide is out, for about five hours, twice a day.",

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements.",
