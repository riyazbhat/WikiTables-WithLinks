It is notable for being the first large scale helicopter air assault and also the first use of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers in a tactical support role. Surrounded and under heavy fire from a numerically superior force, the American forces at LZ X-ray were able to hold off and drive back the North Vietnamese forces over three days of battle, largely through the support of both air power and heavy artillery bombardment, which the North Vietnamese lacked.  LZ X-ray was considered an American tactical victory, as the Americans were able to exact an almost 10:1 kill ratio.  At LZ Albany, the American forces were ambushed in close quarters.  They were unable to use air and artillery support due to the close engagement of the North Vietnamese, the American forces were badly defeated, suffering an over-50% casualty rate before being extricated from the battle.  Both sides, therefore, were able to claim victory in the battle.",
