The club was founded in 1912 by the initiative of three sports enthusiasts from Santos by Raimundo Marques, M\u00e1rio Ferraz de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza J\u00fanior as a response to the lack of representation the city had in football. Since then, Santos became one of Brazil's most successful clubs, becoming a symbol of Jogo Bonito (English: the Beautiful Game) in football culture, hence the motto T\u00e9cnica e Disciplina (Technique and discipline). The most recognized Santista anthem is the Le\u00e3o do Mar written by Mangeri Neto. This was largely thanks to the Peixe's golden generation of the 1960s which contained players such as Gilmar, Mauro Ramos, Meng\u00e1lvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pel\u00e9, named the Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee, and widely regarded as the best and most accomplished footballer in the game's history.
