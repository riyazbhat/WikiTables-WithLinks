Established in 1902 as a picnic spot by the Camden Interstate Railway Company, it is one of only thirteen trolley parks that remain open in the United States.

Not long after opening, the park soon gained a carousel and other roadside attractions.  Camden Park is West Virginia's only amusement park.  The park is home to more than thirty rides and attractions, including a full-size traditional wooden roller coaster, the Big Dipper, and several other vintage rides.\n Over the years, Camden Park has featured a swimming pool, a roller rink, and even a small zoo.

  "/wiki/Jack_Rabbit_(Kennywood)": "Jack Rabbit is a wooden roller coaster located at Kennywood Park near Pittsburgh in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. Designed and built by John A. Miller and Harry C. Baker, Jack Rabbit opened in 1920, making it is one of the oldest roller coasters in the world still in operation, and it's tied with Jack Rabbit at Seabreeze Amusement Park for being the oldest in the United States. The ride's three trains were manufactured by Edward Vettel, Sr. in 1951 and contain three cars of six seats each.  The aging cars are considered a part of the ride's nostalgic experience but also lead to some young children being disallowed to enter the ride (42\u201d is the minimum), due to the use of a small lap bar to hold in riders.  A popular early feature of the ride was a tunnel which covered the turnaround section after the first drop, but this was removed in 1947 when the new cars were ordered. In 1991, the tunnel was restored, at a slightly shorter length.\n The Jack Rabbit was built shortly after Miller patented a new track design in 1920 (which all wooden coasters built since have used). This design involved the use of wheels both under and over the track, which allowed Miller to create the then enormous 70-foot (21 m) drop that is the attraction's largest.  It is most well known for its double dip element following the lift hill. The double dip produces strong airtime that makes the rider feel that they will be thrown from the seat, and a feeling that the train leaves the track (it rises up but the upstop wheels keep it firmly on the rails).\n According to Rick Sebak, producer of Pittsburgh history programs for WQED, the layout and train design results in the rear seat of each train experiencing the greatest amount of airtime.",
