  "/wiki/Wild_Heron": "Wild Heron is a historic plantation house approximately fifteen miles south of Savannah, Georgia. It is one of the oldest domestic structures in Georgia and is a relatively intact example of a typical architectural genre which flourished in coastal Georgia and South Carolina in the eighteenth century. Adding to its significance is its association with Francis Henry Harris (1710-1771) and his son, Col. Francis Henry Harris (1740-1782), prominent figures of the Colonial and Revolutionary eras in Georgia, and the operation through two hundred years as a working rice plantation, owned for much of that time by descendants of the same family. The house was built on a five-hundred acre tract of land granted to Captain David Cutler Braddock in 1747. Braddock, allowed to be an excellent seaman, according to the loyal Governor's Council President, James Habersham in 1750 most likely constructed the house between 1752 and 1756 when Braddock was loaned a large sum of money by Francis Harris. The wainscoting, chimneys, and mantels along with its double spraddle roof are all suggestive of an eighteenth-century construction date. Francis Harris, an English-born accountant, came to Georgia about 1739 to assist Thomas Causton with the trustee accounts. In 1744, Harris became a partner with James Habersham in the commercial firm of Harris and Habersham. Harris was a member of the Royal Governor's Council and the first Speaker of the House of Commons in colonial Georgia. He was married in England about 1754, and tradition holds that his wife, Mary Goodall, was heiress to an estate in Hampshire, England known as Wild Heron, which she sold about the time of her marriage and move to Savannah. Harris abandoned the mercantile trade and became a planter acquiring land on the Little Ogeechee River. He paid 1168 pounds for Braddock's tract, the high price indicating the presence of a house on the property, and the English name was transferred to the American land.",
