The name of the group is very similar to sinsemilla, referring to cannabis which is unfertilised and hence seedless (literally without seed in Spanish). The band first used this name in concert at the F\u00eate de la Musique in 1991, referring to the reggae album Sinsemilia by Black Uhuru. This was the first of more than a thousand concerts, and in the following fifteen years more than one million albums have been sold.

In 2005, because of the success of Tout le bonheur du monde, they were invited by the editors of France 2 to appear on the 1:00 pm news. They began their performance but were quickly interrupted because of their politically charged song Bienvenue en Chiraquie, which provoked a small media scandal. [citation needed]",

  "/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)": "Madonna Louise Ciccone (/t\u0283\u026a\u02c8ko\u028ani/, Italian: [t\u0283ik\u02c8ko\u02d0ne]; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. Referred to as the Queen of Pop since the 1980s, Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in mainstream popular music and for the imagery she uses onstage and in music videos. She has frequently reinvented her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry. Her works have been praised by music critics and have sparked controversy. Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists. Born and raised in Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including global bestsellers Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986) as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Many of her songs have reached the top of record charts worldwide, including Like a Virgin, La Isla Bonita, Like a Prayer, Vogue, Take a Bow, Frozen, Music, Hung Up, and 4 Minutes. Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While Evita earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded an entertainment company called Maverick (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992.",
  "/wiki/Hung_Up": "Hung Up is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). It was written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, and released as the lead single from the album. Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2005. It has also made an appearance on her 2009 greatest hits album, Celebration. Hung Up prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's hit single Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight), for which Madonna personally sought permission from ABBA's songwriters Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus. Musically the song is influenced by pop from the 1980s, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles. Hung Up received critical praise from reviewers, who believed that the track would restore the singer's popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album American Life. Critics suggested it was her best dance track to date and have compared it favorably to other Madonna tracks in the same genre."
