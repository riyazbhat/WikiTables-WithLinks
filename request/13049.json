  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival (or Neo-Romanesque) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century  inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture. Unlike the historic Romanesque style, however, Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts.\n An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil (\"Round-arched style\") was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s. By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free \"Romanesque\" manner was Henry Hobson Richardson. In the United States, the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque, of which not all are Romanesque Revival.\n Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the \"Norman style\" or \"Lombard style\", particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards, respectively.\nLike its influencing Romanesque style, the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches, and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898, and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929.\nThe style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century, especially in the United States and Canada; well known examples can be found at the University of California, Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Tulane University, University of Denver, University of Toronto, and Wayne State University.",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.\n The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture. Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style.\n In form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Therefore, the style defined by symmetry, simple geometry, and social demands instead of ornament. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings.\n In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as Classicism, while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.",

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic_architecture": "National Park Service rustic \u2013 sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture \u2013 is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service (NPS) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment. Since its founding in 1916, the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings. The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world, reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture. Architects, landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes. Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures, including entrance gateways, hotels and lodges, park roads and bridges, visitor centers, trail shelters, informational kiosks, and even mundane maintenance and support facilities. Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",
  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration (WPA; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration) was an American New Deal agency, employing millions of job-seekers (mostly unskilled men) to carry out public works projects, including the construction of public buildings and roads. It was established on May 6, 1935, by Executive Order 7034. In one project, Federal Project Number One, the WPA employed musicians, artists, writers, actors and directors in large arts, drama, media, and literacy projects. The five projects dedicated to these were: the Federal Writers\u2019 Project (FWP), the Historical Records Survey (HRS), the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), the Federal Music Project (FMP), and the Federal Art Project (FAP). In the Historical Records Survey, for instance, many former slaves in the South were interviewed; these documents are of great importance for American history. Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States, and gave more than 225,000 performances. Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures, and the development of professional archaeology in the US.\n The WPA's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $4.9 billion (about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP).\n Headed by Harry Hopkins, the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States, while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society. \n Above all, the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets. Thus, under the leadership of the WPA, more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built, in addition to many airports and much housing.\n The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority, which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power. Many famous structures were constructed with the help of WPA labor and funds, including Camp David, the presidential estate in Maryland often used for international meetings, and the on-ramp to San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.\n At its peak in 1938, it provided paid jobs for three million unemployed men and women, as well as youth in a separate division, the National Youth Administration. Between 1935 and 1943, when the agency was disbanded, the WPA employed 8.5 million people. Most people who needed a job were eligible for employment in some capacity. Hourly wages were typically set to the prevailing wages in each area.:70 Full employment, which was reached in 1942 and emerged as a long-term national goal around 1944, was not the goal of the WPA; rather, it tried to provide one paid job for all families in which the breadwinner suffered long-term unemployment.:64, 184\n \"The stated goal of public building programs was to end the depression or, at least, alleviate its worst effects,\" sociologist Robert D. Leighninger asserted. \"Millions of people needed subsistence incomes. Work relief was preferred over public assistance (the dole) because it maintained self-respect, reinforced the work ethic, and kept skills sharp.\":228\n The WPA was a national program that operated its own projects in cooperation with state and local governments, which provided 10\u201330% of the costs. Usually the local sponsor provided land and often trucks and supplies, with the WPA responsible for wages (and for the salaries of supervisors, who were not on relief). WPA sometimes took over state and local relief programs that had originated in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) or Federal Emergency Relief Administration programs (FERA).:63\n It was liquidated on June 30, 1943, as a result of low unemployment due to the worker shortage of World War II. The WPA had provided millions of Americans with jobs for eight years.:71",

Elements of the Baroque architectural tradition were an essential part of the curriculum of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the pre-eminent school of architecture in the second half of the 19th century, and are integral to the Beaux-Arts architecture it engendered both in France and abroad. \nAn ebullient sense of European imperialism encouraged an official architecture to reflect it in Britain and France, and in Germany and Italy the Baroque Revival expressed pride in the new power of the unified state.",
  "/wiki/Polish_American": "Polish Americans are Americans who have total or partial Polish ancestry. There are an estimated 10.5 million self-identified Polish Americans, representing about 3% of the U.S. population.\n Polish Americans are the largest Slavic and West Slavic ethnic group in the United States, second largest Central European group after the Germans, and the eighth largest immigrant group overall.\n The first Polish settlers arrived at Walter Raleigh's failed Roanoke Colony in 1585. In 1608 Polish settlers came to the Virginia Colony as skilled craftsmen.\n Two early Polish visitors, Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko, led armies in the Revolutionary War and are remembered as national heroes. Overall, around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States,  between 1820 and 1914, chiefly after national insurgencies and famine. They included former Polish citizens of Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or other minority descent. Exact immigration figures are unknown. Many immigrants were classified as \"Russian\", \"German\" or \"Austrian\" by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth were under Prussian, Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control. Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent. In 1940, about 50 percent married other American ethnics and a study in 1988 found that 54% of Polish Americans were of mixed ancestry from three generations or longer. The Polish American Cultural Center places a figure of Americans who have some Polish ancestry at 19-20 million.\n In 2000, 667,414 Americans over 5 years old reported Polish as the language spoken at home, which is about 1.4% of the census groups who speak a language other than English or 0.25% of the U.S. population.",

The style of architecture that was thus created, though also characterised as \"Neo-Renaissance\", was essentially of its own time. \"The backward look transforms its object,\" Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles; \"every spectator at every period\u2014at every moment, indeed\u2014inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature.\"\n The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash, with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire. This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England, from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras. The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s. Barry's Italianate style (occasionally termed \"Barryesque\")  drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance, though sometimes at odds with Nash's semi-rustic Italianate villas.\n The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms, long after its decline in popularity in Britain, throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire. From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States, where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis.",
