He served as Secretary-General of the precursor to the Council of the European Union from its inception as part of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 until 1973. He attended the Lyc\u00e9e classique in Echternach, before studying law in Strasbourg and Paris. In 1940, as a sign of protest against the Nazi occupation of Luxembourg he closed his legal firm, and became a manual labourer in Karelshaff near Colmar-Berg. As a member of the Resistance, he was imprisoned in October 1943 in the Grund, and was later interned in Hinzert concentration camp for 18 months. After escaping in March 1945, he hid until the end of the war. After the war, he worked again as a lawyer, then worked for the government from 1947, as an attach\u00e9, legation secretary, government councillor and highest-ranking diplomat in the foreign ministry.

It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is one of the four official capitals of the European Union (together with Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg) and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial authority in the EU. Its culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours, making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures, as evident by the nation's three official languages: French, German, and the national language of Luxembourgish. The repeated invasions by Germany, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and, among other things, led to the foundation of the European Union. With an area of 2,586 square kilometres (998 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe. In 2019, Luxembourg had a population of 613,894, which makes it one of the least-populous countries in Europe, but by far the one with the highest population growth rate. Foreigners account for nearly half of Luxembourg's population.",
