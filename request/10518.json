The event was only open to men and bouts were contested over four rounds of two minutes each. Five judges scored the fighters in real time and the boxer with the most points at the end was the winner. Three days before the Games opening ceremony the International Olympic Committee announced that Kenyan boxer David Munyasia had tested positive for cathine and has been excluded from the event. Several medalists at the 2004 Olympics, including Amir Khan, Andre Ward, Gennady Golovkin, Yuriorkis Gamboa, and Guillermo Rigondeaux, later went on to become world champions in professional boxing. However, Russian boxers dont typically turn pro as their government provides them with extensive funding which allows them to keep their amateur status and compete at multiple Olympics. The tournament was also Mario Kindel\u00e1n's final Olympic event before retirement, with a second lightweight gold metal after beating Amir Khan.",
