  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead. The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to unpowered (or idler) axles. A refers to one powered axle, B to two powered axles in a row, C to three powered axles in a row, and D to four powered axles in a row. 1 refers to one idler axle, and 2 to two idler axles in a row. A dash (\u2013) separates trucks, or wheel assemblies.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts. The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines, as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery. The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions. Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power. With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1, 2010, the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit.",

  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \nk\ng\nm\n2\ns\n\u2212\n3\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",

The first pre-production units were built in 2004. Evolution Series locomotives are equipped with either AC or DC traction motors, depending on the customer's preference. All are powered by the GE GEVO engine. The Evolution Series was named as one of the 10 Locomotives That Changed Railroading in the January 2009 issue of Trains Magazine. It was the only locomotive introduced after 1972 to be included in that list. The Evolution Series, mainly the ES44DC, ES44AC, and ET44AC, are some of the best-selling and most successful freight locomotives in United States history.",

In October 2005, China Railway ordered 700 ES59ACi Evolution Series locomotives from GE Transportation Systems and Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works for delivery in 2008-2009. Two have been built at Erie, Pennsylvania in 2008; the rest were assembled by Qishuyan at Changzhou in 2008-2010. The first Chinese made loco was unveiled on 25 November 2008. The initial order was reduced from 700 to an actual 300 units produced. The locomotive is equipped with a GE GEVO-16 engine, with an output of 6,250 horsepower (4,660 kW)."
