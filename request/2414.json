  "/wiki/The_Earrings_of_Madame_de...": "The Earrings of Madame de\u2026 (French: Madame de\u2026 [ma.dam d\u0259]) is a 1953 drama film directed by Max Oph\u00fcls, adapted from Louise L\u00e9v\u00eaque de Vilmorin's novel by Oph\u00fcls, Marcel Archard and Annette Wadement. The film is considered a masterpiece of the 1950s French cinema. Andrew Sarris called it \"the most perfect film ever made\". Oph\u00fcls said the story's construction attracted him, stating \"there is always the same axis around which the action continually turns like a carousel. A tiny, scarcely visible axis: a pair of earrings\".\n The film's different titles reflect on the fact that the surname of the Madame in question \u2013 the same as that of her husband's \u2013 is never heard nor seen onscreen. The few times in the film when it might be revealed, it is elided by noise or a camera trick.",

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques, which are critically recognized as among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso, which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.\n Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.\n After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orf\u00e8vres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa m\u00e8re, Clouzot married V\u00e9ra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La V\u00e9rit\u00e9, Clouzot's wife V\u00e9ra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.",
