  "/wiki/Married..._with_Children": "Married... with Children is an American television sitcom that aired on Fox, created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt. Originally broadcast from April 5, 1987 to June 9, 1997, it is the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on Fox and the first to be broadcast in the network's primetime slot. One episode was broadcast on FX on June 18, 2002. The show follows the suburban Chicago lives of Al Bundy, a once-glorious high school football player-turned-hard-luck women's shoe salesman; his lazy wife, Peggy; their attractive, dumb and popular daughter, Kelly; and their smart, horny and unpopular son, Bud. Their neighbors are the upwardly mobile Steve Rhoades and his wife Marcy, who later gets remarried to Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her trophy husband and Al's sidekick. Most storylines involve Al's schemes being foiled by his own cartoonish dim wit and bad luck. The series comprises 259 episodes and 11 seasons. Its theme song is Love and Marriage by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra from the 1955 television production Our Town.",
  "/wiki/Movie_Show": "This is a list of episodes for the seventh season (1992\u201393) of the television series Married... with Children. In this season, the writers introduced Seven (played by Shane Sweet) in an attempt to give the Bundys a third child. When the audience was unreceptive, he was removed from the series with no explanation other than being left at the D'Arcys' (Seven was last seen being told a bedtime story in Peggy and the Pirates). There is, however, a subtle reference to him in Season 8, episode 22, when he appears as the missing child on a carton of milk. Bud also loses his virginity during this season and he makes his first appearance with a beard (which was mistaken for dirt in the episode where Bud first notices he's growing a beard). David Garrison (Steve Rhoades) also makes another guest appearance during this season, also Dan Castellaneta (not as his character on The Dancing Show, but as a funeral parlor salesman), as does Michael Faustino.",
