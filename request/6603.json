  "/wiki/Zumbo": "Zumbo is the westernmost town in Mozambique, on the Zambezi River.

In 2005 Zumbo had a population of 33,000, and it lies in the Zumbo District of Tete Province. Zumbo was established as a trading post in the last part of the 17th century by the Portuguese. It became prosperous as it traded along the middle Zambezi and into Zimbabwe, and up the lower Luangwa, trading for ivory as far away as Lake Bangweulu. It dominated the area, and traders from Zumbo settled in Feira. Zumbo declined after Northern and Southern Rhodesia (later Zambia and Zimbabwe) became part of the British Empire, cutting off its trade with those territories. In the 1970s the Cahora Bassa Dam and lake were created downstream. Zumbo is at the farthest upstream extent of the lake. The town's strategic location meant that in the Mozambican War of Independence and Mozambican Civil War, guerrilla warfare was active in and around the town and many landmines were laid. Zumbo was abandoned for a time in the civil war and partially destroyed, and reconstruction is still continuing. As well as fishing in the river and lake, economic activity relies on trade with the neighbouring countries, inevitably involving smuggling as well.",
