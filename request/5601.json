  "/wiki/Louis_Nirenberg": "Louis Nirenberg (28 February 1925 - 26 January 2020) was a Canadian-American mathematician, considered one of the most outstanding mathematicians of the 20th century. He made fundamental contributions to linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and their application to complex analysis and geometry. His contributions include the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, which is important in the solution of the elliptic partial differential equations that arise in many areas of mathematics, and the formalization of the bounded mean oscillation known as John-Nirenberg space, which is used to study the behavior of both elastic materials and games of chance known as martingales.. His other achievements include the solution to long-standing problems of Weyl and Minkowski, relating to the embedding of a 2-sphere and curvature, respectively; the theory of pseudo-differential operators initiated along with Joseph J. Kohn, the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem of complex structures, Vanishing Mean Oscillation (VMO),\nthe symmetries of solutions of PDEs along with Gidas and Ni, among many others. Nirenberg's work on PDEs has been described as about the best that's been done (as of 2002) towards solving the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem of fluid mechanics, which is a Millennium Prize Problem.",

In 2006 Symbol Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational telecommunications manufacturer, Motorola Corporation. Swartz received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from The City College of New York and a Ph.D. also in electrical engineering from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, receiving fellowships from the National Science Foundation and Ford Foundation along the way. In July 2003, Swartz resigned from his position as chairman and chief scientist of Symbol Technologies, at which time the company was under investigation for civil and criminal accounting fraud. At the time of his resignation, Swartz was quoted in the New York Times as stating that an internal investigation had shown that improper finance and accounting activities occurred while he was chairman. Symbol agreed to settle the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2004, paying a $37 million penalty. Currently, he is the Chairman of The Swartz Foundation for Computational Neuroscience. Established in 1994, it has grown to support research in 11 centers (Brandeis University, California Institute of Technology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Columbia University, Harvard University, New York University, Princeton University, Salk Institute, University of California, San Diego, University of California, San Francisco and Yale University).

  "/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming": "William Edwards Deming (October 14, 1900 - December 20, 1993) was an American engineer, statistician, professor, author, lecturer, and management consultant. Educated initially as an electrical engineer and later specializing in mathematical physics, he helped develop the sampling techniques still used by the U.S. Department of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In his book The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education Deming championed the work of Walter Shewhart, including statistical process control, operational definitions, and what Deming called the Shewhart Cycle, which had evolved into Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA). That was in response to the growing popularity of PDCA, which Deming viewed as tampering with the meaning of Shewhart's original work. Deming is best known for his work in Japan after WWII, particularly his work with the leaders of Japanese industry. That work began in July and August 1950, in Tokyo and at the Hakone Convention Center, when Deming delivered speeches on what he called Statistical Product Quality Administration. Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war on the road to becoming the second-largest economy in the world through processes partially influenced by the ideas Deming taught:",

  "/wiki/Rebecca_Goldstein": "Rebecca Newberger Goldstein (born February 23, 1950) is an American philosopher, novelist and public intellectual. She has written ten books, both fiction and nonfiction. She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy of science from Princeton University and is sometimes grouped with novelists, such as Richard Powers and Alan Lightman, who create fiction that is knowledgeable of, and sympathetic toward, science. In her three nonfiction works she has shown an affinity for philosophical rationalism, as well as a conviction that philosophy, like science, makes progress and that scientific progress is itself supported by philosophical arguments. She has also stressed the role that secular philosophical reason has made in moral advances. Increasingly, in her talks and interviews, she has been exploring what she has called mattering theory as an alternative to traditional utilitarianism. This theory is a continuation of her idea of the mattering map, first suggested in her novel The Mind-Body Problem. The concept of the mattering map has been widely adopted in contexts as diverse as cultural criticism, psychology, and behavioral economics. Goldstein is a MacArthur Fellow and has received the National Humanities Medal, the National Jewish Book Award, and numerous other honors.",
