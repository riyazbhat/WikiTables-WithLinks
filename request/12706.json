  "/wiki/Buttermilk": "Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream; most modern buttermilk is cultured, however. It is common in warm climates (including the Balkans, South Asia, the Middle East and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly.\n Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, which the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat.",
  "/wiki/Kale": "Kale (/ke\u026al/) or leaf cabbage is one of certain cultivars of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) grown for their edible leaves, although some are used as ornamentals. Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage).

  "/wiki/Corned_beef": "Corned beef is salt-cured brisket of beef. The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also called \"corns\" of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are also added to corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines. Most recipes include nitrates or nitrites, which convert the natural myoglobin in steak to nitrosomyoglobin, giving it a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium botulinum bacteria spores, but have been shown to be linked to increased cancer risk. Beef cured without nitrates or nitrites has a gray color, and is sometimes called \"New England corned beef\". Corned beef was popular during both World Wars, when fresh meat was rationed.",
