  "/wiki/Bear_Valley,_Mariposa_County,_California": "Bear Valley (formerly Haydenville, Biddle's Camp, Biddleville, Simpsonville, and Johnsonville) is a census-designated place in Mariposa County, California. It is located 10.5 miles (17\u00a0km) south-southeast of Coulterville, at an elevation of 2054 feet (626 m). Bear Valley was designated California Historical Landmark #331. The population was 125 at the 2010 census.\n The place was originally called Haydenville in honor of David, Charles, and William Hayden, gold miners. The place later bore the names Biddle's Camp and Biddleville in honor of William C. Biddle. It later was named Simpsonville in honor of Robert Simpson, local merchant. The name Johnsonville honored John F. Johnson. The name became Bear Valley in 1858.\n The Haydenville post office opened before January 21, 1851 and closed in 1852. The Bear Valley post office operated from 1858 to 1912, from 1914 to 1919, and from 1933 to 1955.\n In 1847, John C. Fr\u00e9mont, a veteran of the Bear Flag Revolt, decided to settle down in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Desiring a ranch near San Jos\u00e9, California, he sent $3,000 to the American consul Thomas O. Larkin.  Instead of his intended purchase, he was sold Rancho Las Mariposas, consisting of 44,387 acres (179.6\u00a0km2) in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills around Bear Valley.  The original Mexican grant was a \"floating grant\", a grant of land for which the area was precisely given but the actual boundaries were left unspecified (usually due to inadequate surveys of the areas involved).  After the beginning of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Fremont moved his grant's borders into the hills.  Those hills proved to be lucrative and his mining operations centered in Bear Valley.\n At its peak, Bear Valley had a population of 3,000.  During 1850-60 when Fr\u00e9mont's Pine Tree and Josephine Mines were producing, Fr\u00e9mont built an elegant hotel, Oso House; the structure, like many in the area, burned in the late 19th century.  Fr\u00e9mont lived and worked in the city, and his large home was nicknamed the Little White House, coincidentally built two years after he was the first Republican Party candidate for US President; the home burned in 1866.",
