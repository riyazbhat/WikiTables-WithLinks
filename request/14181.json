Named a historic site in 1979, it was built for one of the area's largest landowners. While young, James Booth emigrated from England to Coshocton County, where he settled in the vicinity of Newcomerstown. In 1843, aged eighteen, Booth arranged for the construction of the present house; he may have done the work himself, or he may simply have paid for the labor of others. Booth's design mixed traditional building styles with influences from the popular Greek Revival style of architecture. Shaped like the letter L, the house possesses a facade divided into five bays, of which the middle contains the main entrance. James Booth was among Guernsey County's leading landowners; at his peak, he was possessed of more than 700 acres (280 ha). Upon Booth's death, his heirs shared his property between themselves at 120 acres (0.49 km2) apiece, with his son Milton Booth inheriting the homestead. He managed the property until his premature death in 1907, when it passed to his sister Mary Jane and her husband Jasper Little. Several years later the property came into the possession of Frank Booth, a grandson of James Booth. It remained in his hands until his death in the 1970s, when it passed out of the family.

Home to a prominent early citizen of the area, it is one of Guernsey County's best early houses still in existence, and it has been named a historic site. Constructed in 1832, the Broom-Braden House was originally home to the Broom family, a leading family in the early years of Guernsey County. Hugh Broom, the paterfamilias, occupied multiple prominent places in area society. As a religious leader, he was long the pastor of the Baptist church in Cambridge, and during the 1840s, he helped to found other churches in the surrounding countryside. As a farmer, he both tilled the soil and raised livestock, and by 1840 his estate was among the area's largest, embracing 400 acres (160 ha) in Cambridge Township and additional lands in surrounding townships. In 1858, he was elected as one of Guernsey County's two state representatives. He arranged for the construction of the present house in 1832, and detail to parts of the stonework were far more attentive than what then and currently are found. The windowsills and other parts of its fa\u00e7ade are of careful hand-chisel work. Yet, the overall massing of the structure is unexceptional; one and a half stories tall, the house is a simple rectangle with an ordinary gabled roof. Small curved dormer windows are set within the roof, while each end of the roofline is pierced by a large chimney. Its location on sloping land causes the front and rear to sit at slightly different elevations, while the nearly windowless sides are placed along the slopes.",

  "/wiki/Samuel_Harper_Stone_House": "The Samuel Harper Stone House is a historic residence in rural Guernsey County, Ohio, United States. A traditional building constructed in the 1840s by a well-known local builder, it has been named a historic site. The first resident of the house, Samuel Harper, was an ancestor of founding University of Chicago president William Rainey Harper, although the latter man was never associated with his forefather's house. Construction was performed in 1841 by Norwich resident Archibald Boal, who gained the reputation of a master stonemason through his work on buildings such as the Harper House. Constructed of sandstone on a foundation of another kind of stone, the Harper House is typical of the once-common vernacular building form known as the I-house. The two-story interior is built around a central hallway on each floor, with rooms on either side. The fa\u00e7ade is a simple rectangle, with narrow sides rising to gables and a wider five-bay fa\u00e7ade. A chimney pierces the roofline at either end, while the fa\u00e7ade features openings in each bay of each story; all are windows except the center of the first story, in which the main entrance is placed. The building is exceedingly simple, with virtually no ornamentation; the sole exception is slight decoration above the main entrance on the lintel. Assorted farm-related outbuildings surround the house, which predates all of the outbuildings. In early 1980, the Harper House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. The same designation was granted on the same day to the James Hunter Stone House near Adamsville to the west, another building constructed by Archibald Boal.",

It was once home to one of the city's political leaders, and later a Presbyterian minister. Few extant buildings in the city can compare to it architecturally, and it has been named a historic site. William McCracken settled in Cambridge in 1809 at the age of twenty-two. Although he began his residency as a simple blacksmith, McCracken later made himself into one of the most prominent members of local society. McCracken arranged for the construction of the present house, built in 1825, but his wealth was sufficient to pay for the erection of a brick house in the same neighborhood in 1830. Two years later, William McFarland was born in New Athens. At the age of twenty-five, he was ordained as a minister in one of the denominations that later formed the United Presbyterian Church of North America. McFarland moved to Cambridge in 1860 to pastor its United Presbyterian congregation, soon taking possession of the house, and it remained the property of the McFarland family until his daughter conveyed it to the Guernsey County Historical Society in 1966. Since that time, the society has converted the house into its museum. Greek Revival in style, the McCracken-McFarland House is a weatherboarded structure with a slate roof. It sits slightly above the sidewalk; one must climb two small sets of steps to attain the six-columned porch on the front of the house.",

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_40_in_Ohio": "U.S. Route 40 or U.S. Highway 40 (US 40), also known as the Main Street of America, is a major east-west United States Highway traveling across the United States from the Mountain States to the Mid-Atlantic States. As with most routes whose numbers end in a zero, US 40 once traversed the entire United States. It is one of the first U.S. Highways created in 1926 and its original termini were in San Francisco, California and Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the western United States, US 40 was functionally replaced by Interstate 80 (I-80), resulting in the route being truncated multiple times. US 40 currently ends at a junction with I-80 in Silver Summit, Utah, just outside Salt Lake City. Starting at its western terminus in Utah, US 40 crosses a total of 12 states, including Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. US 40 passes through or by major cities including Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, Baltimore, and Wilmington. Three former and four current state capitals lie along the route. [a] For much of its route, US 40 runs parallel to or concurrently with several major Interstate Highways: I-70 from Colorado to Washington, Pennsylvania; and again from Hancock, Maryland to Baltimore; I-64 in parts of Missouri and Illinois; I-68 along the Maryland Panhandle; and I-95 from Baltimore to New Castle, Delaware. The route was built on top of several older highways, most notably the National Road and the Victory Highway.

It was the home of one of Cambridge's leading residents in the late nineteenth century, and it has been named a historic site. Designed by Samuel Hannaford, it was the home of Joseph Danner Taylor, a local newspaperman and politician, U.S. Army judge soon after the Civil War, and U.S. Representative. Possessed of a strong mind from young boyhood, Taylor was fondly remembered by his neighbors as a paragon of community virtue,:953 as well as for his unwavering editorial support of the war when so many men quavered or actively sought to subvert the national struggle. :955\n Taylor's house mixes two related architectural styles, the Queen Anne and the Stick-Eastlake. Built of wood on a stone foundation, the house is topped with a two-part roof: some is slate-covered, while the rest is protected by asphalt. The two-and-a-half-story facade is composed of three distinctive sections: the middle, comprising an elaborate porch with projecting eaves and a smaller sheltered pair of windows on the second story; a plain right side (as seen from the street) with flat walls, a third-floor gable, and a simple window in each story; and a three-story left side dominated by a large bay window on the first and second stories and a prominent overhang on the third. The entire building is covered with a multi-part gabled roof. In 2008, the Taylor House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of connection to Joseph Taylor. By that time, it had been converted into a bed and breakfast, the Colonel Taylor Inn."
