His record score of 559 would still be competitive today in this event. He also won the World Championships in Free Pistol in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1947 and 1952. Ullman was not a free pistol specialist but rather an all-round shooter, achieving great successes in all three pistol events that existed at the time. In the Rapid Fire competition in Berlin, he won the bronze medal after an extremely rapid shoot-off, and three years later he became World Champion in that event, being one of only four shooters to win major worldwide titles in both 50 m Pistol and 25 m Rapid Fire Pistol. He entered the first World Championship in 25 m Center-Fire Pistol in 1947, surprisingly with a Smith & Wesson revolver, and won by seven points, causing a worldwide revolver hype. He repeated this victory in 1954. Ullman was one of the first sport shooters to take practice and preparation to a scientific level, which he himself always claimed was a main reason for his success. In 1937, he received the Svenska Dagbladet gold medal for the greatest Swedish sports achievement of the year. He is the only pistol shooter to have received this prestigious award. Besides his shooting career, Ullman worked with pistol development, and co-authored a widely spread book on shooting with Lev Weinstein.
