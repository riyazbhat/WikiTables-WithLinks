  "/wiki/Tom_Iredale": "Tom Iredale (24 March 1880 \u2013 12 April 1972) was an English-born ornithologist and malacologist who had a long association with Australia, where he lived for most of his life. He was an autodidact who never went to university and lacked formal training. This was reflected in his later work; he never revised his manuscripts and never used a typewriter.",

  "/wiki/Queensland": "Queensland (locally /\u02c8kwi\u02d0nzl\u00e6nd/ KWEENZ-land,[note 1] abbreviated as Qld) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. To its north is the Torres Strait, with Papua New Guinea located less than 200\u00a0km across it from the mainland.

  "/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus": "Carl Linnaeus (/l\u026a\u02c8ni\u02d0\u0259s, l\u026a\u02c8ne\u026a\u0259s/; 23 May[note 1] 1707 \u2013 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linn\u00e9 (Swedish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0\u026d f\u0254n l\u026a\u02c8ne\u02d0] (listen)), was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\". Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us (after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9).",
  "/wiki/Foraminifera": "Foraminifera (/f\u0259\u02ccr\u00e6m\u0259\u02c8n\u026af\u0259r\u0259/; Latin for \"hole bearers\"; informally called \"forams\") are members of a phylum or class of amoeboid protists characterized by streaming granular ectoplasm for catching food and other uses; and commonly an external shell (called a \"test\") of diverse forms and materials. Tests of chitin (found in some simple genera, and Textularia in particular) are believed to be the most primitive type. Most foraminifera are marine, the majority of which live on or within the seafloor sediment (i.e., are benthic), while a smaller variety float in the water column at various depths (i.e., are planktonic). Fewer are known from freshwater or brackish conditions, and some very few (nonaquatic) soil species have been identified through molecular analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA.",
  "/wiki/Adriatic_Sea": "The Adriatic Sea /\u02cce\u026adri\u02c8\u00e6t\u026ak/ is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres (4,045\u00a0ft). The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The\u00a0Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant. Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, it is usually referred to as a separate body of water. Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9\u00a0million years ago, the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years (the Messinian salinity crisis) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3\u00a0million years ago.",

  "/wiki/Helix_(genus)": "Helix is a genus of large, air-breathing land snails native to Europe and the Mediterranean region. They are the type genus of the family Helicidae and among the first animal genera described by Carl Linnaeus. Members of the genus first appeared during the Oligocene. Like most land snails, Helix species are hermaphroditic, and like other helicids a courting pair will impale each other with hormone-rich love darts prior to exchanging sperm. Well-known species include Helix pomatia (Roman snail, Burgundy snail, or edible snail) and Helix lucorum (Turkish snail). Cornu aspersum (garden snail) \u2013 another well-known helicid \u2013 was originally described as a member of Helix (as \"Helix aspersa\"), but the prevailing classification places it in the sister genus Cornu.",

  "/wiki/Nomen_nudum": "In taxonomy (especially in zoological and botanical nomenclature), a nomen nudum (\"naked name\"; plural nomina nuda) is a designation which looks exactly like a scientific name of an organism, and may have originally been intended to be a scientific name, but fails to be one because it has not (or has not yet) been published with an adequate description (or a reference to such a description). This makes it a \"bare\" or \"naked\" name, one which cannot be accepted as it stands. A largely equivalent but much less frequently used term is nomen tantum (\"name only\").",

According to legend they populated Kerkyra until shortly after the Corinthians settled the island, c. 730 BC."
