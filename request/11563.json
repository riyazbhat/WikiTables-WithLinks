  "/wiki/Koala": "The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.

It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60\u201385\u00a0cm (24\u201333\u00a0in) and weighs 4\u201315\u00a0kg (9\u201333\u00a0lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.
