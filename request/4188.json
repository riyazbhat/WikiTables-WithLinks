  "/wiki/Bell_of_Batoche": "The Bell of Batoche is a 20-pound silver-plated church bell believed to have been seized in 1885 as spoils of war from the M\u00e9tis community of Batoche (now in Saskatchewan) by soldiers from Ontario, following their victory in the Battle of Batoche over the North-West Rebellion. The bell was kept in Millbrook, Ontario, until 1991, when it was stolen from the Royal Canadian Legion hall. It resurfaced in 2013 in M\u00e9tis hands. However, evidence suggesting the bell's actual origin was from Frog Lake, Alberta, emerged soon after. Questions about its authenticity as the Bell of Batoche ensued until April 2014 when Le Mus\u00e9e de Saint-Boniface Museum director acknowledged that there was enough evidence to conclude that the Bell of Batoche which is in the possession of the museum was actually the Bell of Frog Lake taken from the Frog Lake Mission in 1885.",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Batoche": "The Battle of Batoche was the decisive battle of the North-West Rebellion, which pitted the Canadian authorities against a force of indigenous and M\u00e9tis people. Fought from May 9 to 12, 1885, at the ad hoc Provisional Government of Saskatchewan capital of Batoche, the greater numbers and superior firepower of General Frederick Middleton's force could not be successfully countered by the M\u00e9tis, as had happened at the earlier Battle of Fish Creek, and the town was eventually captured. The defeat of the M\u00e9tis led to the surrender of Louis Riel on May 15 and the collapse of the Provisional Government. Poundmaker surrendered on May 26. Cree fighters and families under Big Bear held out the longest, fighting off Canadian troops pursuing them in the Battle of Frenchman's Butte and Battle of Loon Lake, and, gradually dwindling in number, staying on the move until Big Bear eventually turned himself in to Mounties at Fort Carlton in early July.",

The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories, of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part, and of the District of Assiniboia. The site was previously called Wascana (Buffalo Bones in Cree), but was renamed to Regina (Latin for Queen) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria. This decision was made by Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Louise, who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada, the Marquess of Lorne. Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West, on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off, Wascana Creek. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre (850 ft) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake. Regina's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906.",
