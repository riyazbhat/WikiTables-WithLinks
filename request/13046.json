Currently, the president of the ASC is Kees van Oostrum. Members use the post-nominal letters ASC. On the 1920 film titled Sand, cinematographer Joseph H. August, who was an original member of the ASC, became the first individual to have the ASC appear after his name on the onscreen credit. Only film cinematographers and special effect supervisors can become an ASC member. Basic requirements include being a director of photography for a minimum five out of the last eight years, having a high professional reputation and being recommended by three active or retired ASC members. The ASC is criticised for the lack of women on the board. Out of the active members on the ASC, only four percent are women.",
