  "/wiki/Politics": "Politics is the set of activities that are associated with the governance of a country, state or an area. It involves making decisions that apply to groups of members.\n It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance\u2014organized control over a human community, particularly a state. The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than general political science, is sometimes referred to as politology (not to be confused with politicology, a synonym for political science).\n In modern nation-states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas. Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.\n An election is usually a competition between different parties. Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, the Democratic Party (D) in the United States, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Germany and the Indian National Congress in India which has the highest number of political parties in the world (2546 political parties) .\nPolitics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as \"the art or science of government\" and \"political principles\"), but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation. The word has been used negatively for many years: the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to \"Confound their politics\", and the phrase \"play politics\", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: \"We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.\"\n A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level. During the past decade two tendencies (1.Concern for theoretical explication and methodological rigor, and 2. The emphasis on field studies of the \u201cemerging,\u201d \u201cnew,\u201d and \u201cnon-Western\u201d nations) made it possible to overlook comparative politics. \n A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a  society. The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics, the works of Confucius and Arthashastra and Chanakya neeti by Chanakya in 3rd Century BCE.",

A High Commissioner is equivalent to an ambassador, originally between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and now between all Commonwealth states, whether Commonwealth realms, republics, or countries having a monarch other than that of the realms. The title is sometimes given to senior officials in the private sector; for instance, many North American sports leagues.\n There is some confusion between commissioners and commissaries, because other European languages use the same word for both.
