It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers. The name Paran\u00e1 is an abbreviation of the phrase \"para rehe on\u00e1va\", which comes from the Tupi language and means \"like the sea\" (that is, \"as big as the sea\").[citation needed]  It merges first with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the R\u00edo de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.\n The first European to go up the Paran\u00e1 River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot, in 1526, while working for Spain.",

It flows from north to south and forms parts of the boundaries of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, separating some of the Argentine provinces of La Mesopotamia from the other two countries. It passes between the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil; forms the eastern border of the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre R\u00edos in Argentina; and makes up the western borders of the departments of Artigas, Salto, Paysand\u00fa, R\u00edo Negro, Soriano, and Colonia in Uruguay.",
  "/wiki/R\u00edo_Negro_(Argentina)": "R\u00edo Negro (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8ri.o \u02c8ne\u0263\u027eo]; Black River) is the most important river of the Argentine province of R\u00edo Negro, and Patagonia in relation to its flow rate. Its name comes from the literal translation of the Mapuche term Curu Leuvu, although the water is more green than black. Formerly, it was also known as \"river of the willows\" because of the big number of weeping willows that grow along the bank. It's 635\u00a0km in length.\n It originates from the junction of the Limay River and Neuqu\u00e9n River at the border with the Neuqu\u00e9n Province, and flows southeast to the Atlantic Ocean at 41\u00b001\u203220\u2033S 62\u00b047\u203225\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff41.0223\u00b0S 62.7903\u00b0W\ufeff / -41.0223; -62.7903, near El C\u00f3ndor beach resort some 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) downstream from Viedma, R\u00edo Negro province's capital.\n The river allows the R\u00edo Negro province to produce 65% of the pears and apples of Argentina. Besides irrigation, the river is also source of hydroelectricity with small dams on its course.\n The river served as natural demarcation between \"civilization\" and the aboriginal territories during the Conquest of the Desert of late 19th century.",
  "/wiki/Bermejo_River": "The Bermejo River (Spanish, R\u00edo Bermejo) is a river in South America that flows from Bolivia to the Paraguay River in Argentina. The river is generally called Bermejo in spite of its different names along its way, but it also has its own Native American names; in Wich\u00ed it is called Teuco, and in Guaran\u00ed it is called Ypit\u00e1. In the plains of Argentina's Gran Chaco the Bermejo forms wetlands and splits into two branches. The southern branch is the bed of the old Bermejo River, now an intermittent stream called R\u00edo Bermejito. The northern branch is now the main stem of the Bermejo and is called the Teuco River (R\u00edo Teuco), Bermejo Nuevo, or simply the Bermejo River. The two branches rejoin at 25\u00b039\u2032S 60\u00b011\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff25.650\u00b0S 60.183\u00b0W\ufeff / -25.650; -60.183, near Villa R\u00edo Bermejito, forming the Lower Bermejo River.\n The Bermejo River is 1,060 kilometres (660\u00a0mi) long and has a drainage basin of 123,000 square kilometres (47,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area. Its mean annual discharge is irregular and varies between 20 cubic metres per second (710\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) and 14,000 cubic metres per second (490,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).\n The river is born in a mountain range known as Sierra de Santa Victoria around coordinates 22\u00b000\u203214\u2033S 64\u00b057\u203230\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff22.00389\u00b0S 64.95833\u00b0W\ufeff / -22.00389; -64.95833 near Tarija, a few kilometres southeast of Chaguaya in Bolivia, and not far from La Quiaca, Jujuy Province, Argentina. In general, it maintains a southeastern direction. At its highest part, its main tributaries are the Lipeo River, and further downstream the Grande de Tarija, the Iruya River, and the San Francisco River. It forms part of the international boundary between Argentina and Bolivia.\n The Bermejo is not navigable. In the late 19th century, numerous attempts were made to open up the commercial navigation of the river, but all of them failed, largely due to the river's shallow waters, which carry enormous amounts of sediment. Near the Tropic of Capricorn, the river splits in two; the smaller southern branch, Bermejito, and the northern branch that known as the Teuco River (also called Bermejo or Bermejo Nuevo). When leaving the province of Salta, the Teuco marks the boundary between the provinces of Chaco and Formosa.\n The Bermejito, is intermittent and meandering. It crosses Chaco Province near the El Impenetrable jungle. On the shores of this river can still be seen the ruins of the former towns of Concepcion del Bermejo, San Bernardo de V\u00e9rtiz (25\u00b08\u2032S 61\u00b08\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff25.133\u00b0S 61.133\u00b0W\ufeff / -25.133; -61.133), and La Cangay\u00e9 (25\u00b036\u2032S 60\u00b019\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff25.600\u00b0S 60.317\u00b0W\ufeff / -25.600; -60.317).\n The Teuco follows its course to finality and into the Paraguay River, in front of the city of Pilar, in Paraguay.\n The river carries red-coloured sediments and produces irregular accumulations that can even alter its course, leaving the older paths as wet depressions.",

At 1,100 kilometres (680\u00a0mi) long, it is the longest western tributary of the Paraguay River. Its drainage basin is 270,000 square kilometres (100,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area, and its mean discharge is 200 cubic metres per second (7,100\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).\n Along its course, the Pilcomayo silts up and splits into two main branches, North and South. After some distance, these branches rejoin to form the Lower Pilcomayo.\n The Pilcomayo rises in the foothills of the Andes mountain range in the Bolivian Oruro Department, east of Lake Poop\u00f3. The Jach'a Juqhu River is considered the origin of the Pilcomayo. Upstream the Jach'a Juqhu River successively receives the names Aguas Calientes and Kachi Mayu. From the confluence with the Chillawa (Chillahua), the river is called Pilcomayo. From there, it flows in a southeasterly direction through Chuquisaca and Tarija departments, passes through the Argentine province of Formosa and the Gran Chaco plains of Paraguay, forming the border between these two countries before it joins the Paraguay River near Asunci\u00f3n. The R\u00edo Pilcomayo National Park is located on the Argentine side of the border. It also forms a short part of the boundary between Argentina and Bolivia, just prior to the Argentina\u2013Bolivia\u2013Paraguay tripoint.",

Its man-made dam, \"Embalse Casa de Piedra,\" serves both to generate hydroelectricity for the arid region the river traverses, and to regulate the river's water level.",
  "/wiki/Salado_River_(Buenos_Aires)": "The Salado River (Spanish: R\u00edo Salado, Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8ri.o sa\u02c8la\u00f0o]) is a river in northern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It originates at El Cha\u00f1ar Lake on the boundary with Santa Fe Province, 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) above mean sea level, and flows generally southeast for 640 kilometres (400\u00a0mi) before debouching into Samboromb\u00f3n Bay, part of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary on the Atlantic Ocean. The Salado's mouth is about 170 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) south of the city of Buenos Aires.\n The Salado's drainage basin is about 170,000 square kilometres (66,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which is over half of the province's area. The region receives an annual average of 2,000 millimetres (79\u00a0in) of precipitation, which often causes flooding in the low-lying area. The river flows by the cities of Jun\u00edn, Roque P\u00e9rez, and General Belgrano, as well as a number of wetlands and lakes; channelization of the lower course has improved the drainage of the river's 88 cubic metres per second (3,100\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). Nearly 1 million people live in the basin.\n Hydrological studies have been performed in the Salado basin, principally in the Azul, Buenos Aires creek basin by the Instituto de Hidrologia de Llanuras de Azul. Ecological studies have been done by the Ecology group of Facultad de Agronom\u00eda de la UNICEN.\n In the 19th century, before the Conquest of the Desert, the Salado River served as frontier boundary between the Spanish colonised lands and those still under control of the indigenous peoples.\n Because Argentina has another, more important Salado River, in the northern part of the country, this Salado River is sometimes called Salado del Sur (\"Southern Salado\").",

  "/wiki/Chubut_River": "The Chubut River (Spanish: R\u00edo Chubut, Welsh: Afon Camwy) is located in the Patagonia region of southern Argentina. Its name comes from the Tehuelche word chupat, which means \"transparent\". The Argentine Chubut Province, through which the river flows, is named after it. Welsh settlers called the river \"Afon Camwy\", meaning \"twisting river\".\n The river is generally shallow and its water flow can vary from 4 to 400 cubic metres per second (140 to 14,130\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) between drought and flood. Average discharge is about 60 cubic metres per second (2,100\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).\n Flooding made the lands beside the river fertile and important for agriculture. The river has great importance for the agricultural and general economy of the province. There were several attempts to create dams near the two townships of Rawson and Gaiman. The Chubut River has a very rare characteristic being higher than the land around it which is mostly arid. Wheat farming was the chief crop and mainstay of the agricultural and commercial resource of Patagonia. At this time the settlers were struggling with finance as they were using sterling, which was in very short supply. Wheat and barley became a more readily available material to trade with. The control of water for irrigation became even more important to newly arriving settlers who were allocated parcels of land or \"chacras\" issued by the Argentine government in the lower part of the valley. In 1882, following a very bad harvest in 1881 a scheme of irrigation ditches from a new canal would ensure consistent watering of crops and deal with the vagaries of the flow of the Chubut. This was key to the survival of the whole Chubut valley. The construction of the canal and irrigation system was overseen by a young Welshman, E. J. Williams. His meticulous planning created a detailed system of ditches and channels according to an agreed size and fee structure with the settlers. These landowners dug the channels themselves with simple tools.\n The river is also a popular trout fishing destination.",

Originating near the Tipas volcano in La Rioja at about 5,500\u00a0m (18,000\u00a0ft) elevation, the river is known in its upper reaches as the Bermejo or Vinchina. In its lower reaches it is also known as the Salado. It joins the Colorado River in La Pampa Province near Pichi Mahuida. The Desaguadero River has a total length of 1,498\u00a0km (931\u00a0mi) and its drainage basin is about 260,000\u00a0km2 (100,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n It is one of the major rivers that supplies the irrigated areas of Cuyo, and it flows in the eastern border of that region. Due to use of its waters for irrigation, the river is a small, shallow stream for most of the year despite its great length, and only occasionally does surface flow reach the Colorado.\n Tributaries include the Jach\u00e1l, San Juan, Tunuy\u00e1n, Diamante and Atuel Rivers.",
  "/wiki/Deseado_River": "Deseado River (Spanish: R\u00edo Deseado) is a river in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz. The name Deseado comes from the English Desire, the name of one of the two ships commanded by John Davis during the Thomas Cavendish expedition of 1592.\n The river is born from the glacier-thaw Buenos Aires Lake on the northwestern part of the province at the Andes range, and travels for 615 kilometres (382\u00a0mi) before reaching the Atlantic Coast. On its way southeast, its water is tapped for irrigation. Its tributaries include the Pinturas River and the F\u00e9nix River.\n The river sometimes disappears under the arid terrain, to re-emerge before reaching Puerto Deseado on Santa Cruz's coastline, where it produces a deep-water natural port. The outlet of the river has become submerged and inundated by sea water, forming an estuary. In 1977, this was set aside as a nature reserve, the Reserva Natural R\u00eda Deseado.",
  "/wiki/Water_resources_management_in_Argentina": "Water resources management (WRM) functions in Argentina are handled by multiple institutions operating at the national, provincial, and river basin level, with a variety of functions and jurisdictions. On the national level, the National Institute for Water and the Environment (INA) and the National Water and Sanitation Utility (AySA) are charged with the duties of researching, water resources preservation, developing services, and implementing water projects.\n Connectivity to water in urban settings is quite good in Argentina, but rural communities lag far behind that of less developed nations. This problem is made worse by one of the highest levels of per capita usage in the world at around 500 L/day. Large rivers and aquifers represent the main source of drinking water supplies and they are facing serious water pollution problems from industrial effluents, urbanization, and harmful agriculture practices.\n Many other challenges persist throughout the country and most are regionally focused with varying degrees because Argentina is divided into many different climatic regions. Some of the critical issues are identified as an inadequate regulatory and institutional framework, inter-sectoral conflict, limited capacity in water management at the central and provincial levels, and high risk for flooding in urban and rural areas."
