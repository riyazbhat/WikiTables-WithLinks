The NBA was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The NBA adopted its current name at the start of the 1949\u201350 season when the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). The league currently consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and 1 in Canada. Each team plays 82 games in the regular season. After the regular season, eight teams from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs. At the end of the playoffs, the top two teams play each other in the Conference Finals, to determine the Conference Champions from each side, who then proceed to play in the NBA Finals.",

It documents the team\u2019s season-by-season records, including post-season records, and also includes year-end awards won by the team's players and/or coaches.\n With seventeen NBA Championships, the Celtics have won more than any other NBA franchise, while the 1959-to-1966 domination of the NBA Championship, with eight straight titles, is the longest consecutive championship winning streak of any North American professional sports team to date. Following this, the Celtics had two major periods of success separated by quite poor seasons during rebuilding.

The Celtics have had 13 separate seasons where they won 60 or more regular season contests, the highest number for any franchise.\n Between 1993\u201394 and 2006\u201307 the Celtics had their single sustained period of failure, with an overall win percent of .423 and only twice getting beyond the first playoff round. With the acquisition of Kevin Garnett for 2007\u201308, the Celtics achieved a record single-season rise in win percentage to claim their first title in twenty-two seasons, in the process achieving the best average point differential between the 1995\u201396 Bulls and the 2015\u201316 Warriors. The team remained a power until after the 2011 lockout, but lost to the Lakers in their most recent Finals appearance.\n The Celtics are 23\u20138 all-time in seventh games of playoff series, and 7\u20131 in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.",

The first owners purchased the disbanded Gems from Detroit, Michigan, then renamed and moved the team. It was in Minneapolis where the Lakers received their official title from Minnesota's nickname, Land of 10,000 Lakes. The Lakers won five championships before relocating to Los Angeles for the 1960\u201361 NBA season. The Lakers went on to lose all of their six appearances in the NBA Finals in the 1960s, despite the presence of Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. In 1972, the Lakers compiled a 33-game winning streak, the longest streak in U.S. professional team sports, and won their sixth title, under coach Bill Sharman. The Lakers' popularity soared in the 1980s when they won five additional championships during a nine-year span with the help of Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and coach Pat Riley, the franchise's all-time leader in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins. Two of those championships during that span were against their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics. With the help of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, the Lakers played in seven NBA Finals between 2000 and 2010, winning three of them consecutively from 2000 to 2002, losing the next two in 2004 and 2008, and winning in 2009 and 2010; the last three appearances were without O'Neal.\n The Lakers hold records for having (at the end of the 2014\u201315 NBA season) the most wins (3,125), the highest winning percentage (.620), the most NBA Finals appearances (31) of any NBA franchise, second-fewest non-playoff seasons with seven and are second NBA championships with 16, behind the Boston Celtics' 17. They have won 60+ regular season games 11 times, trailing only the Boston Celtics in this category.\n However, the team has struggled in recent years. They are currently suffering the longest playoff drought in franchise history, having failed to qualify for the postseason for the past six years, after having missed the playoff only five times prior in their entire existence up to 2013; this period is only the second time in the team's entire history that they have missed out on playoff contention in consecutive seasons.",

Going into the 1984 playoffs, the Lakers had already won 2 titles in the 1980s and the Celtics 1, making the revival of the Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry arguably inevitable and certainly highly anticipated.\n Two teams made their playoff debuts and won their first playoff series: the Utah Jazz (who joined the NBA for the 1974\u201375 season as the New Orleans Jazz) and Dallas Mavericks, a 1981 expansion team.

The Warriors joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946 and won the first BAA championship title in the same year, under coach Edward Gottlieb. The Warriors joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26\u201342 in their first NBA season, and they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962\u201363 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. After playing several home games in Oakland from 1967 onward, the team moved to Oakland full-time for the 1971\u201372 NBA season and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors.\n Led by Rick Barry, the Warriors were a strong franchise during the middle 1970s, achieving winning records every season from 1971\u201372 to 1977\u201378, winning two division titles, and winning the 1975 NBA championship.

Since 1996, the Sixers have played home games at Wells Fargo Center.\n In 1937, owner Daniel Biasone founded the franchise as the Syracuse Nationals, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs three times then joined the NBA in 1949, one of seven NBL teams to merge with the rival Basketball Association of America (BAA). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs in every season played in Syracuse, advancing to three Finals and Losing. For the 1963\u201364 season, the year following the departure of the Philadelphia Warriors for San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia as the 76ers.\n The franchise has played fifty-three seasons as the Philadelphia 76ers, with thirty-three playoff appearances and zero championships. The Sixers acquired Philadelphia-native Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 from the Warriors and defeated Chamberlain's former team in the 1967 Finals, but suffered a sharp fall from grace due to the loss of Chamberlain to retirement and Billy Cunningham to the ABA: in 1972\u201373 the team won only nine games, the fewest in an 82-game NBA season. Under coaches Gene Shue and Cunningham, and the on-court leadership of forward Julius Erving, the 76ers returned as a power quite rapidly, achieving winning records in all but one season from 1975\u201376 to 1990\u201391.

In 2000\u201301 the Iverson-led 76ers won fifty-six games and defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals to reach the 2001 Finals but lost to the Lakers four games to one in the best-of-seven series. The 76ers were a middle-of-the-road team on-court during the following dozen seasons, but by the early 2010s financial problems led incoming general manager Sam Hinkie to clean out any expensive players in order to save money and gain draft choices for the future. Lacking on-court talent, the 76ers set many records for ineptitude in the following three seasons, becoming the second NBA team after the 1995\u201396 to 1998\u201399 Grizzlies to suffer three consecutive seasons winning fewer than twenty games.

The 1999 NBA Playoffs were the last time a Game 7 wasn't played.\n This postseason and the previous year's postseason marked the first time since the 2000 and 2001 playoffs that both number 5 seeds knocked out both number 4 seeds in back-to-back years.\n This was the first postseason (and the seventh time since 1972, when the current playoff system was put in place) in which the top two seeds played in the Conference Finals both in the East and the West.\n When they defeated Indiana on the road in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat set an NBA record by recording their 15th straight playoff series in which they earned at least one road win. The Heat then extended the record to 16 straight road wins in playoff series by winning Game 2 of the NBA Finals in San Antonio.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Cleveland_Cavaliers_seasons": "The Cleveland Cavaliers (also known as the Cavs) are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. They began playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1970. This list summarizes the team's season-by-season records, including post-season, and includes select season-end awards won by the team's players and/or coaches.

They have been awarded the first overall draft pick six times, choosing Austin Carr (1971), Brad Daugherty (1986), LeBron James (2003), Kyrie Irving (2011), Anthony Bennett (2013) and Andrew Wiggins (2014). In his last season with the Cavs, Austin Carr won the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, the first of four Cavaliers to win the award (Eric Snow, Luol Deng and LeBron James won the award in 2005, 2014 and 2017, respectively). As a Cavalier, LeBron won Rookie of the Year as well as four MVP awards and two All Star Game MVP awards. He also led the Cavaliers to five NBA Finals, including the last 4 straight, and won the 2016 title as Finals MVP. Cleveland's next first overall pick after James, Kyrie Irving, won Rookie of the Year in 2012 and NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2014.\n In their 48 seasons, the Cavs have achieved a winning record 23 times. Highlights include 20 playoff appearances, which included winning the Central Division championship six times (1975\u201376, 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, and 2017\u201318), winning the Eastern Conference championship five times (2006\u201307, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, and 2017\u201318), and winning the NBA Title in 2016.

Overall, their winning percentage through the years is .456, with 1660 wins and 1967 losses in regular season play (as of March 13, 2015). They are 84 and 84 in the playoffs, a winning percentage of .500.
