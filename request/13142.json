  "/wiki/United_States_Navy": "The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the eight uniformed services of the United States. It is the largest and most capable navy in the world and it has been estimated that in terms of tonnage of its active battle fleet alone, it is larger than the next 13 navies combined, which includes 11 U.S. allies or partner nations. It has the highest combined battle fleet tonnage and the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with eleven in service, two new carriers under construction, and five other carriers planned. With 336,978 personnel on active duty and 101,583 in the Ready Reserve, the U.S. Navy is the third largest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of personnel. It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of June 2019[update], making it the third-largest air force in the world, after the United States Air Force and the United States Army.\n The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers, the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates, the first ships of the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers. It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan. The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world. The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it a frequent actor in U.S. foreign and military policy.\n The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Secretary of Defense. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is the most senior naval officer serving in the Department of the Navy.",
  "/wiki/United_States_Third_Fleet": "The United States Third Fleet is one of the numbered fleets in the United States Navy. Third Fleet's area of responsibility includes approximately fifty million square miles of the eastern and northern Pacific Ocean areas including the Bering Sea, Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and a sector of the Arctic. Major oil and trade sea lines of communication within this area are critically important to the economic health of the United States and friendly nations throughout the Pacific Rim region.\n First established in 1943, the Third Fleet conducted extensive operations against Japanese forces in the Central Pacific during World War II. Deactivated in 1945, the fleet remained inactive until 1973, when it was reactivated and assumed its current responsibilities.",

  "/wiki/Michael_A._Healy": "Michael Augustine Healy (September 22, 1839 \u2013 August 30, 1904) was a career officer with the United States Revenue Cutter Service (predecessor of the United States Coast Guard), reaching the rank of captain. He commanded several vessels within the territory of the Alaskan coastline.\n Following U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward's Alaska purchase of the vast region in 1867, Healy patrolled the 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of Alaskan coastline for more than 20 years, earning great respect from the natives and seafarers alike. After commercial fishing had depleted the whale and seal populations, his assistance with the introduction of Siberian reindeer helped prevent starvation among the native Alaskans. The author Jack London was inspired by Healy's command of the renowned  USRC Bear. It was a thick wooden hulled, steam-and-sail powered proto-icebreaker, which had been put into service as a cutter, in 1884.\n Nicknamed \"Hell Roaring Mike,\" Healy was the fifth of 10 children of the  Healy family of Georgia, known for their achievements in the North after being born into slavery. Their parents were an Irish-born planter and his African-American mixed-race slave, with whom he had a common-law marriage. His father arranged for the children to be formally educated at boarding schools in the North, and they identified as Irish Catholics. Healy has also been recognized since the late 20th century as the first man of African-American descent to command a ship of the United States government. The USCGC Healy, commissioned in 1999, was named in his honor.",
  "/wiki/United_States_Revenue_Cutter_Service": "The United States Revenue Cutter Service was established by an act of Congress (1 Stat. 175) on 4 August 1790 as the Revenue-Marine upon the recommendation of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to serve as an armed customs enforcement service. As time passed, the service gradually gained missions either voluntarily or by legislation, including those of a military nature. It was generally referred to as the Revenue-Marine until 31 July 1894, when it was officially renamed the Revenue Cutter Service.\n The Revenue Cutter Service operated under the authority of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On 28 January 1915, the service was merged by an act of Congress with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard.",
  "/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard": "The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the coastal defense, search and rescue, and maritime law enforcement branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's eight uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its duties. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. Congressional authority transfers happened twice: in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II.\n Created by the U.S. Congress on 4 August 1790 at the request of Alexander Hamilton as the Revenue-Marine, it is the oldest continuous seagoing service of the United States.[Note 1] As Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton headed the Revenue-Marine, whose original purpose was collecting customs duties at U.S. seaports. By the 1860s, the service was known as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the term Revenue-Marine gradually fell into disuse.\n The modern Coast Guard was formed by a merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915, under the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 1939, the U.S. Lighthouse Service was also merged into the Coast Guard. As one of the country's six armed services, the Coast Guard has been involved in every U.S. war from 1790 to the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.\n In 2018, the Coast Guard has 40,992 active duty employees, 7,000 reservists, and 8,577 full-time civilian employees, for a total workforce of 56,569. The Coast Guard maintains an extensive fleet of 243 coastal and ocean-going patrol ships, tenders, tugs, icebreakers, and 1,650 smaller boats, as well as an aviation division consisting of 201 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. While the U.S. Coast Guard is the second smallest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of membership, the U.S. Coast Guard by itself was the world's 12th largest naval force in 2018.",
  "/wiki/William_J._McCarthy": "William J. McCarthy (July 2, 1919 \u2013 November 19, 1998) was an American labor leader and official in the Teamsters. He was appointed president of the Teamsters on July 18, 1988, defeating interim president Weldon Mathis. Although he began a re-election campaign in 1990, a new democratic election process and the rise of a reform movement within the union led him to withdraw and retire at the end of his term.  He stepped down as president at the end of 1991 when his term of office ended.\n McCarthy was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1919. When he was 15, McCarthy stole a car and took Boston police on a high-speed chase. He ditched the car near the offices of Teamsters Local 25 and hid in the cab of a tractor-trailer truck. When the driver returned, McCarthy talked him into taking him to New York City. McCarthy and the driver became friends, and McCarthy learned to drive a big rig. In 1936, McCarthy stole a blank baptismal certificate and faked his birth date so he could qualify for a chauffeur's license.  He joined Local 25, and worked for Benjamin Motor Express. McCarthy served in the United States Army during World War II.\n In 1946,McCarthy was elected president of the 7,000-member local. McCarthy was elected an international vice president of the Teamsters in 1969. He was elected president of Joint Council 10, which oversaw all Teamsters locals in New England, in 1972. McCarthy ran for election for First Vice President, then the union's number-two position, in 1984. He lost. Union President Jackie Presser accused him of seeking the assistance of organized crime in his election bid. McCarthy denied the accusation, and the case was closed after no additional evidence was forthcoming.\n In June 1988, union president Jackie Presser took a leave of absence due to ill health.  Weldon Mathis, then the union's secretary-treasurer, was named his successor. Mathis enforced two union contracts even though the membership had not approved them by a majority vote. When Presser died in June 1988, McCarthy chose to challenge Mathis for the presidency.  On July 18, 1988, after a contentious executive board meeting, McCarthy defeated Mathis 9-to-8.\n In 1989, McCarthy negotiated an agreement which ended a United States Department of Justice lawsuit seeking trusteeship of the Teamsters union. McCarthy agreed to seek democratic internal reforms and purge the union of corruption.\n In 1990, McCarthy announced he would seek election for a full term as president.  Ron Carey, a Teamster leader from New York City, challenged him for the presidency.  McCarthy's political position in the union weakened, and he pulled out of the race in favor of R.V. Durham. He twice faced charges that he had improperly awarded a printing contract to a printing house owned by his son-in-law, once in February 1991 and again in June 1991. Each time, the union's executive board agreed to put off a vote, and McCarthy retained his office.\n McCarthy lost a re-election as president of Local 25 to George W. Cashman in 1991. In 1992, McCarthy retired as president of Joint Council 10, which he had run for 20 years, and retired to his small brick house in Arlington, Massachusetts.\n McCarthy and his wife Mary (n\u00e9e Joyce) had two daughters and two sons.\n McCarthy died of complications from heart disease on November 19, 1998, in Arlington.",

  "/wiki/Marine_Corps": "Marines, also known as naval infantry, are typically an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land and air, as well as the execution of their own operations. In many countries, the marines are an integral part of that state's navy. In others, it is a separate organization altogether, such as in the United States, where the Marine Corps falls under the US Department of the Navy, yet it operates independently (and similarly the UK's Royal Marines come under Her Majesty's Naval Service). Marines can also fall under a country's army like the Troupes de marine (i.e. the French marines).\n Historically, tasks undertaken by marines have included: helping maintain discipline and order aboard the ship (reflecting the pressed nature of the ships' company and the risk of mutiny), the boarding of vessels during combat or capture of prize ships, and providing manpower for raiding ashore in support of the naval objectives.\n With the industrialization of warfare in the 20th century the scale of landing operations increased; this brought with it an increased likelihood of opposition and a need for co-ordination of various military elements. Marine forces evolved to specialize in the skills and capabilities required for amphibious warfare.",

Initially formed as a part of the United States Army on 1 August 1907, the USAF was established as a separate branch of the U.S. Armed Forces on 18 September 1947 with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947. It is the second youngest branch of the U.S. Armed Forces,[a] and the fourth in order of precedence. The U.S. Air Force articulates its core missions as air superiority, global integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, rapid global mobility, global strike, and command and control.\n The U.S. Air Force is a military service branch organized within the Department of the Air Force, one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The Air Force, through the Department of the Air Force, is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Air Force, who reports to the Secretary of Defense, and is appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. The highest-ranking military officer in the Air Force is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, who exercises supervision over Air Force units and serves as one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Certain Air Force components are assigned, as directed by the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Air Force, to unified combatant commands. Combatant commanders are delegated operational authority of the forces assigned to them, while the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force retain administrative authority over their members.\n Along with conducting independent air operations, the U.S. Air Force provides air support for land and naval forces and aids in the recovery of troops in the field. As of 2017[update], the service operates more than 5,369 military aircraft, 406 ICBMs and 170 military satellites.
