  "/wiki/Barry_John": "Barry John (born 6 January 1945) is a former Welsh rugby union fly-half who played, during the amateur era of the sport, in the 1960s, and early 1970s. John began his rugby career as a schoolboy playing for his local team Cefneithin RFC before switching to first-class west Wales team Llanelli RFC in 1964. It was while at Llanelli that John was first selected for the Wales national team, a shock selection as a replacement for David Watkins to face a touring Australian team.\n In 1967 John left Llanelli RFC for Cardiff RFC and here he formed a partnership with Gareth Edwards that became one of the most famous half-back pairings in world rugby. From 1967, John and Edwards made an inseparable partnership with rugby selectors, being chosen to play together at all levels of the sport, for Cardiff, Wales, the Barbarians and in 1968 for the British Lions tour of South Africa. The 1968 British Lions tour ended prematurely for John when he suffered a broken collarbone in the first Test match against the South African national team.\n In 1971 the Wales national team entered what is considered their second 'Golden Age', with a team rich in experience and talent. John was part of the team that won the 1971 Five Nations Championship, the first time Wales had achieved a Grand Slam win since 1952. He then cemented his reputation as one of the sport's greatest players with his pivotal role in the British Lions winning tour over New Zealand in 1971. On the 1971 tour, John played in all four Tests, playing some of his finest rugby and finishing as the Lions' top Test scorer.\n John won 25\u00a0caps for the Wales national team and five for the British Lions. Possessing excellent balance to his running and along with precision kicking made him one of the great players of the modern era. He retired from rugby at the age of 27, as Wales highest points scorer, citing the pressure of fame and expectation behind his decision.",
  "/wiki/Andrew_Mehrtens": "Andrew Philip Mehrtens MNZM (born 28 April 1973 in Durban, South Africa) is a former New Zealand rugby union footballer. He was regarded as a top Fly-half, having played first for Canterbury in 1993, before being selected for the All Blacks (New Zealand's national team) in 1995 when he played in the 1995 World Cup.\n Since his move to England, and later to France, he helped his first three clubs to promotion into their country's top flight. He first joined Harlequins in England, where in his first season he played a major factor in leading the freshly relegated club to an immediate return to the top-level Guinness Premiership. After seeing Harlequins successfully through their first season back in the Premiership, he went to the ambitious Pro D2 club Toulon for the 2007\u201308 season. After Toulon won the title to secure an immediate return to the Top 14, he remained in Pro D2, moving to another ambitious side, Racing M\u00e9tro. For the second straight season, his team won the Pro D2 crown and a spot in the Top 14.",
  "/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team": "The New Zealand national rugby union team, commonly known as the All Blacks, represents New Zealand in men's international rugby union, which is considered to be the country's national sport. The team won the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and 2015, as well as the inaugural tournament in 1987.\n New Zealand has a 77 per cent winning record in test match rugby, and is the only international men's side to have secured more wins than losses against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have played test matches against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the All Blacks. The team has also played against three multinational all-star teams, losing only eight of 45 matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. They jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation, along with England.\n The All Blacks compete with Argentina, Australia and South Africa in The Rugby Championship, and have won the trophy sixteen times in the competition's 23-year history. The team has completed a Grand Slam tour, against the four nations of the United Kingdom, four times (1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010). New Zealand has been named the World Rugby Team of the Year ten times since the award was created in 2001, and an All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award ten times over the same period. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame.\n The team's first match was in 1884 in New South Wales, and their first international test match was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year, they hosted their first-ever home test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington.[a] This was followed by a 34-game tour of Europe and North America in 1905 (which included five test matches), where New Zealand suffered only one defeat: their first ever test loss, against Wales.\n New Zealand's early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. By the 1905 tour, they were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and the name \"All Blacks\" dates from this time. The team performs a haka before every match; this is a M\u0101ori challenge or posture dance, which has traditionally been Te Rauparaha's Ka Mate, although Kapa o Pango has also been performed since 2005.",
  "/wiki/List_of_leading_international_rugby_union_drop_goal_scorers": "This is a list of the leading drop goal scorers in rugby union test matches, with a minimum of ten test drop goals. Test caps are awarded by a player's national union, regardless of whether the opposition recognise it as such. Note, however, that if one nation grants a match test status and the opponents do not then only the statistics for the nation granting test status are counted in test totals. Composite teams made up of players selected from multiple unions\u2014for example the British and Irish Lions and Pacific Islanders\u2014are also considered test teams because they are selected by a group of recognised national governing bodies.\n Only teams for which a player has scored a test drop goal are included in the table; players may have played for other test sides. Table including matches played 7 September 2019:\n Players who are still active at international level are in bold."
