  "/wiki/Battle_of_Dutton's_Hill_Monument": "The Battle of Dutton's Hill Monument in Pulaski County, Kentucky, near Somerset, Kentucky, commemorates the Confederate soldiers who died at the battle of Dutton's Hill. Today the battlefield of Dutton's Hill is on private property. It is located about a mile from the intersection of highways 39 and 80. A historical marker is at the entrance to four homes, which are at the forefront of the hill. On July 17, 1997, the Battle of Dutton's Hill Monument was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. The 6' 2 marble obelisk marks a mass grave of Confederate casualties from the campaign, their names lost to history for 143 years. The inscription on the memorial has been damaged by acid rain and farming. Much of it is illegible today. The inscription reads Here off duty until the last reveille, lie the southern soldiers, in numbers who were slain in this country during the war of the succession. They fell among strangers, unknown and unfriended. Yet not unhonored; for strangers hands have gathered their ashes here, and placed the shaft above them, that constancy and valor, though displayed in a fruitless enterprise, may not be unremembered.",

  "/wiki/Kentucky_Route_80": "Kentucky Route 80 (KY 80) is a 483.55-mile-long (778.20 km) state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of Kentucky. The route originates on the state's western border at Columbus in Hickman County, and stretches across the southern portion of the state, terminating southeast of Elkhorn City on the Virginia state line. It is the longest Kentucky State Highway, though the official distance as listed in route logs is much less due to multiple concurrencies with U.S. Route 68 (US 68) and U.S. Route 23. The route was split into two segments from 2003 to November 2009. Construction and relocation of Kentucky Route 80 in Graves, Calloway, and Marshall counties during this time caused the route to be split. A new, four-laned 8.5-mile (13.7 km) section of Kentucky Route 80 opened in Calloway County on November 25, 2009. The route is now four-lanes from Mayfield to Aurora with plans to complete the four-laning from Aurora to Cadiz over the next few years. [citation needed]",
