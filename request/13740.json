The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building, in Washington, D.C. The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The Senate is composed of senators, each of whom represents a single state in its entirety. Each state, regardless of its population size, is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years. There being at present 50 states in the Union, there are currently 100 senators. From 1789 to 1913, senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; they are now elected by popular vote, following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. As the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it. These include the approval of treaties, and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, federal judges, flag officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers. In addition to these, in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president, the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office. Furthermore, the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House. The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.",

  "/wiki/United_States_Tax_Court": "The United States Tax Court (in case citations, T.C.) is a federal trial court of record established by Congress under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, section 8 of which provides (in part) that the Congress has the power to constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court. The Tax Court specializes in adjudicating disputes over federal income tax, generally prior to the time at which formal tax assessments are made by the Internal Revenue Service. Though taxpayers may choose to litigate tax matters in a variety of legal settings, outside of bankruptcy, the Tax Court is the only forum in which taxpayers may do so without having first paid the disputed tax in full. Parties who contest the imposition of a tax may also bring an action in any United States District Court, or in the United States Court of Federal Claims; however these venues require that the tax be paid first, and that the party then file a lawsuit to recover the contested amount paid (the full payment rule of Flora v. United States). Tax Court judges are appointed for a term of 15 years, subject to presidential removal for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The main emblem of the tax court represents a fasces.",

  "/wiki/Pennsylvania's_10th_congressional_district": "Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District is located in the south-central region of the state. It encompasses all of Dauphin County as well as parts of Cumberland County and York County. The district includes the cities of Harrisburg and York. Prior to 2019, the district was located in the northeastern part of the state. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional due to gerrymandering. They added State College to the old district's boundaries while removing some Democratic-leaning areas and redesignated it the twelfth district, and they reassigned the tenth district to an area around Harrisburg and York. The new tenth district is represented by Republican Scott Perry, who previously represented the old fourth district. The district was one of the 12 original districts created prior to the 4th Congress. In 2006, when it was still located in northeastern Pennsylvania, the 10th district experienced one of the greatest party shifts among all House seats that switched party control: in 2004, Republican Don Sherwood won with an 86% margin of victory over his nearest opponent and two years later, Democrat Chris Carney unseated Sherwood by a 53%-47% margin. In 2008, Carney won reelection by 12 points but the district swung back in 2010, electing Republican Tom Marino. The district was mostly Republican in its political composition, an aspect of the district that was reflected especially well in presidential elections. In 2004, President George W. Bush won 60 percent of the vote in the district and in 2008, Senator John McCain beat Senator Barack Obama here by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent.",

  "/wiki/Governor_of_Puerto_Rico": "The governor of Puerto Rico (Spanish: gobernador(a) de Puerto Rico) is the head of government of Puerto Rico and, by its nature, constitutes the executive branch of the government of the island. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the island's military forces, the Puerto Rico National Guard. The governor has a duty to enforce its laws, to convene the Legislative Assembly, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly, to appoint government officers, to appoint justices, and to grant pardons. Since 1948, the governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico. Prior to that, the governor was appointed either by the king of Spain (1510-1898) or the president of the United States (1898-1948). Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the governor and empowers them with the faculty to appoint officers. Law No. 104 of 1956 empowers them with the faculty to delegate functions. These two faculties in conjunction allow the governor to delegate most of their functions while continuing to be the maximum officer and head of government. Most of the governor's functions are delegated[citation needed] to the chief of staff, who is charged with managing and overseeing all the executive departments and almost all executive agencies. The budget is delegated to the director of the Office of Management and Budget while centralized planning is delegated to the president of the Planning Board. This effectively makes the governor a political figure rather than an administrative one, allowing them to set the vision for what the island should be and where it should go rather than having to be involved in its day-to-day operations.",
