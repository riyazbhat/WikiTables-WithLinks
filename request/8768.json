It is presented at numerous annual events held throughout the calendar year, each honoring one of the various sectors of the television industry. The two ceremonies that receive the most media coverage are the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable Emmy events include those honoring national sports programming, national news and documentary shows, and technological and engineering achievements in television, including the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards. Regional Emmy Awards are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local and statewide television. In addition, the International Emmy Awards honor excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States. The Emmy is named after immy, an informal term for the image orthicon tube that was common in early television cameras. The statuette depicts a winged woman holding an atom. The Emmy is considered one of the four major American entertainment awards, the others being the Grammy (for music), the Oscar (for film), and the Tony (for theater). Three related, but separate, organizations present the Emmy Award: the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS), the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS), and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (IATAS). The ATAS first awarded the Emmy in 1949 to honor shows produced in the Los Angeles area before it became a national event in the 1950s to honor programs aired nationwide. Over the next two decades, the ATAS, the NATAS, and the IATAS expanded the award to honor other areas of the TV industry, with each organization responsible for administering a particular set of Emmy competitions.",

For example, an economics degree may be given as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) by one university but as a BS by another, and some universities offer the choice of either. Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA, even in the natural sciences, while some universities offer only the BS, even in non-science fields. At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline, the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field.",

  "/wiki/IMAX": "IMAX is a proprietary system of high-resolution cameras, film formats, film projectors, and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio (approximately 1.43:1 & 1.90:1) and steep stadium seating. Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation (founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation, Limited), and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada. Unlike conventional film projectors, the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock. When IMAX was introduced, it was a radical change in the movie-going experience. Viewers were treated to the scene of a gently-curved giant screen more than seven stories tall (75 feet (23 m), with the tallest measuring 117 feet (36 m)) and steep stadium seating that made for a visually immersive experience. This was enhanced by a sound system that was far superior to the audio at typical theaters in the years prior to the advent of THX. Some IMAX theaters have a hemispheric dome screen geometry, which can give the viewer an even more immersive feel. Over the decades since its introduction, IMAX evolved to include 3D stereoscopic films, introduced in January 1998, and then began to proliferate with a transition away from analog film into the digital era. Beginning in May 1991, a visceral dimension of the movie experience was added by having the audience's seats mounted on a full-motion platform as an amusement park ride in IMAX ride film theaters. With the advent of digital projection, the IMAX brand has also been applied to lower-resolution imaging systems, causing some degree of confusion among the viewing public.",
