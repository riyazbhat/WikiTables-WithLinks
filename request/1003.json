Unlike members of most international organisations, the member states of the EU have agreed by treaty to shared sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some (but by no means all) aspects of government. Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt some policies; for others, collective decision making is by qualified majority voting. Subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taking collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually, is a founding principle of the EU. In 1957, six core states founded the EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. To accede, a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic, free-market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law.",

After World War II, the party settled as one of the four major political parties in Finland, alongside the National Coalition Party, the Social Democrats, and, until the 1980s, the Communist SKDL. Urho Kekkonen served as President of Finland from 1956 to 1982: by far the longest period of any president. The name 'Centre Party' was adopted in 1965, and 'Centre of Finland' in 1988.
