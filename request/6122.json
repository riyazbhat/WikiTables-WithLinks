  "/wiki/Michael_Kelso": "Michael Kelso is a fictional character and one of the five male leads on Fox Network's That '70s Show, portrayed by Ashton Kutcher. Tall, lanky and long-haired, Kelso had been accepted as the local idiot until he moved to Chicago for the eighth season. His behavior is very much in line with a stereotypical oversexed lunkhead or a male-bimbo who gets through life on his good looks. He spends most of the series in a mutually parasitic relationship with the equally vapid Jackie Burkhart, whom he continues to obsess over following their numerous breakups. In spite of his stupidity, Kelso is shown on several occasions not to be immature, simply unmotivated; when he is either forced to or chooses to, Kelso displays startling intelligence unbecoming of his usual personality or hi-jinks. Near the end of the series, Kelso becomes one of the first characters to completely break away from adolescence and into adulthood when he impregnates a girl with whom he had a one-night stand; to his friends' surprise, Kelso took responsibility for the child, moving to Chicago to take a job to support and be near his newborn daughter.",
