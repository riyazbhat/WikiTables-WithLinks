By the 1930s this building had become dilapidated and it was considered a fire trap. In July 1938 local voters passed a bond issue and the Works Progress Administration approved the application to construct a new school building. Fergus Falls architect E.O. Broaten designed the building in the Moderne style. The T-shaped structure features a raised basement of exposed reinforced concrete and split-stone walls on the main level. The main level contained two classrooms, a library, and an office, while the basement housed a community room with a stage, a kitchen, fuel room, boiler room, and storage room. The building served as a school until 1982.  Five years later a non-profit arts group reopened it as an art center, but foundered after encountering financial difficulties.
