The park is bounded on the east by the 605 Freeway, on the north by the Long Beach Town Center shopping mall, and on the south by Stearns Street. Because of the barrier of the freeway and park between the neighborhood and the rest of Long Beach, as well as the barrier created by near Norwalk Blvd and the Coyote creek and the neighboring cities, the El Dorado Park neighborhood feels quite separate.",
