He is considered to be one of the best decathlon athletes of all time. Originally a high jumper, he later switched to the combined events and is a former world record holder in the decathlon. In 2001 in G\u00f6tzis he became the first decathlete ever to achieve over 9,000 points, setting the record at 9,026 points, succeeding his compatriot, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, who had scored 8,994 points two years earlier. After placing second in the decathlon during the 2000 Summer Olympics, \u0160ebrle won the gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Tradition dictates the winner of the decathlon holds the title of World's Greatest Athlete. A panel of experts convened by the Wall Street Journal in 2008 also ranked \u0160ebrle as the world's greatest athlete. That very same year, \u0160ebrle finished 6th in the decathlon in the Beijing Olympics.",
