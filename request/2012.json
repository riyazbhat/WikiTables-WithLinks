  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead. The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to unpowered (or idler) axles. A refers to one powered axle, B to two powered axles in a row, C to three powered axles in a row, and D to four powered axles in a row. 1 refers to one idler axle, and 2 to two idler axles in a row. A dash (\u2013) separates trucks, or wheel assemblies.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts. The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines, as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery. The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions. Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power. With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1, 2010, the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit.",
  "/wiki/GE_C32-8": "The GE C32-8 was a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems in 1984. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. Only 10 of these 3,200 hp (2,390 kW) locomotives were built. They were some of the first locomotives built in the DASH-8 line with all 10 going to Conrail as road numbers 6610 to 6619. When delivered they wore the standard Conrail Can Opener (Wheel on Rail) paint scheme. In 1997 Conrail assigned all 10 units to Ballast Express service. They were repainted into a Gray version of the Quality scheme.",

  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \nk\ng\nm\n2\ns\n\u2212\n3\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",

  "/wiki/GE_C39-8": "The GE C39-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems between 1984 and 1987. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. A total of 161 examples of this locomotive were built for two North American railroads: Conrail and Norfolk Southern Railway. The C39-8 was a fairly unpopular locomotive with crews, cited factors such as a rough ride, tendency to overheat, frequent turbocharger issues, issues with the fuel injection system, and various other reliability issues.

  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40C": "The GE C40-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems between 1987 and 1992. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives, and its wheel arrangement is of a C-C type. This locomotive model is often referred to as a Dash 8-40C or simply Dash 8. Dash 8 in general refers to the electrical control series, Dash being a carryover from the older syntax of C40-8. The 40 refers to the baseline horsepower rating (4,000 hp or 3,000 kW) of the unit, although some units may be re-rated to 4,100 hp (3,100 kW). Later units were supplied with a wide-nose cab and are designated Dash 8-40CW, the W indicating a wide-nose cab.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40CM": "The GE C40-8M is a 6-axle diesel locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems from 1990 to 1994. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives, and is often referred to as a Dash 8-40CM. Mechanically identical to the Dash 8-40CW, the Dash 8-40CM was constructed only for Canadian railways, with a production total of 84 units. It is distinguished from the Dash 8-40CW by the addition of a full-width cowl body and the use of a Canada-specific nose and windshield configuration. The trucks also differ; all units built ride on Dofasco trucks identical to locomotives built by Montreal Locomotive Works, Bombardier, and Morrison-Knudsen.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-40CW": "The GE C40-8W is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems from 1989 to 1994. Often referred to as a Dash 8-40CW, it is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. This locomotive model is distinguished from the predecessor Dash 8-40C by the addition of a newer wide or safety cab. A cowl-bodied version of this locomotive, built only for the Canadian market, was the GE Dash 8-40CM.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8.5-40CW": "The GE Dash 8.5-40CW is 6-axle a 4,000 hp (2,800 kW) diesel-electric locomotive originally built by GE Transportation Systems, rebuilt by Norfolk Southern at its shops in Roanoke, VA. The first locomotive started rebuild 2012. The locomotive is designed to meet Tier 2 emissions standards. All of the Dash 8.5-40CW's excluding 8500 and 8505 have been rebuilt with the Norfolk Southern-designed wide-nose RLS cab which meets current FRA crashworthiness standards. 8500 was rebuilt with an SD60E style Norfolk Southern-designed Crescent cab while 8505 was rebuilt with an ES44AC style GE cab. They have been equipped with the Traction and Engine Control Unit (TECU) from TMV Control Systems, upgraded from Manual Fuel Injection (MFI), to Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI), and equipped with NS-designed split cooling system. The rebuild also includes the installation of locomotive speed limiter (LSL), and cab signals. The traction motors were upgraded from GE752-AG to GE752-AH.",
  "/wiki/GE_Dash_8-44CW": "The GE C44-8W is a 4,400 hp (3,280 kW) diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems of Erie, Pennsylvania. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. They are considered to be pre-production Dash 9s with the innards of it but trapped in an extended Dash 8 carbody as well as having the trucks. They are numbered 9000-9052. The first three were originally supposed to be the last order of Dash 8s for CSX thus having the smaller Dash 8 carbody. They have been derated to 4000 horsepower and are now designated C40-9W. In keeping in GE tradition of giving nicknames to its locomotive series beginning with the Dash 7 of the 1970s, the C44-8W was dubbed the Dash 8 upon its debut. The design has since proven popular with North America railroads."
