It was moved to its present location in 1873 and renamed to Oyama-jinja. The main gate was constructed in 1875. This gate is a peculiar mix of traditional Japanese, Chinese, and European religious architectural elements. The gate is 25 metres (82 ft) high including the lightning rod. The third floor is particular famous for its Dutch stained-glass windows. It is said that the third floor was also used as a lighthouse.

The walkway, named Horsetail corridor (\u3064\u304f\u3057\u306e\u5eca\u4e0b), is famous for being 20 meters long, with no supporting beams holding up the roof. The roof is supported with a cantilever that extends 10 meters back into the building, a Meiji-period architectural innovation. The first floor showcases extensive architectural uses of artwork, from painted screens and doors to stained glass imported from the Netherlands. The second floor of the building is decorated in strong reds, blues and purples in the sukiya-shoin (\u6570\u5947\u5c4b\u98a8\u66f8\u9662) style.
