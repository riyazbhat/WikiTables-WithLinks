  "/wiki/Thirteen_(2003_film)": "Thirteen is a 2003 American teen drama film directed by Catherine Hardwicke, written by Hardwicke and Nikki Reed, and starring Evan Rachel Wood, Holly Hunter, and Reed. Loosely based on Reed's life from ages 12 to 13, the film's plot follows Tracy, a junior high school student in Los Angeles who begins dabbling in substance abuse, sex, and crime after being befriended by a troubled classmate. It features Brady Corbet, Deborah Kara Unger, Kip Pardue, and Vanessa Anne Hudgens in supporting roles. The screenplay for Thirteen was written over a period of six days by Hardwicke and the then-14-year-old Reed; Hardwicke, a former production designer, independently raised funds herself for the production. Filming took place on location in Los Angeles in 2002, largely shot with hand-held cameras, evoking a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 visual style. Upon the film's debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2003, Hardwicke won the Sundance Directing (Drama) for the film. Fox Searchlight Pictures subsequently acquired Thirteen for distribution, giving the film a limited release in the United States beginning on August 20, 2003; the release would expand in September 2003, and the film went on to gross a total of $4.6 million at the United States box office. Though it received numerous favorable reviews from critics, Thirteen generated some controversy for its depiction of youth drug use (including inhalants, marijuana, LSD, and alcohol), underage sexual behavior, and self-harm.",
  "/wiki/Film_director": "A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfilment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors.",
