  "/wiki/John_Williams_(Manitoba_politician)": "John Williams (July 3, 1860 \u2013 March 2, 1931) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.  He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1907 to 1910, and again from 1914 to 1922.  Williams was a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and briefly served as a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris.\n Born at Ysceifiog in Flintshire, Wales, the son of Thomas Williams and Hannah Phillips, Williams was educated at common schools. After reaching the age of thirteen, he worked in the lead means and farmed and then came to Canada in May 1881 with \"absolutely no capital\".  After living in Hamilton, Ontario, where he worked on a farm, for a year and a half, he moved to Manitoba in November 1882 to become a farmer.  He remained in this vocation until 1906, and served for a time as director of the Melita Farmers' Elevator Company. Williams also served as president of the local Grain Growers' Association and Agricultural Society and was reeve for the Rural Municipality of Arthur.\n Williams first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1903 provincial election, running in the southwestern constituency of Arthur.  He lost to Conservative incumbent Allen Thompson by forty-eight votes.  Thompson retired at the 1907 election, and Williams defeated new Conservative candidate Amos Lyle by a margin of three votes (536 to 533).  Williams served as an opposition member for the next three years.\n In the provincial election of 1910, Lyle defeated Williams by 175 votes to regain Arthur for the Conservatives.  Control of the riding shifted again in the 1914 campaign, when Williams defeated Lyle by sixty-six votes.  He again served as an opposition member.\n Early in 1915, the governing Conservative Party of Rodmond Roblin was forced from office amid scandal.  The Liberals won a landslide victory in the 1915 provincial election, and Williams was elected by an increased margin in Arthur.  After this election, he served as a backbench supporter of Norris's ministry.  In the 1920 election, Williams defeated Farmer candidate Duncan Lloyd McLeod by only ten votes.\n Norris's Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1920 election, and had difficulty passing legislative initiatives in the next two years.  The government was defeated in the legislature in early 1922, and elections were called for later in the year.  Williams was called on to play a prominent role in the campaign, and was promoted to cabinet on June 6, 1922 as Minister of Agriculture.\n The Liberals were defeated by the United Farmers of Manitoba in the 1922 provincial election, and Williams lost his seat to McLeod by 353 votes.  He resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Norris ministry on August 8, 1922.\n In the 1925 federal election, Williams run for the House of Commons of Canada as the candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in Souris.  He finished third against Progressive candidate James Steedsman.\n In 1928, Williams was named Canadian commissioner of immigration for Wales.\n He was married to Clementine Rogers in 1892.\n Williams died on his farm in Melita at the age of 70.",

He subsequently moved to Manitoba in 1880, where he worked as a farmer and store manager and served as Reeve of the Municipality of De Salaberry from 1892 to 1896. In 1888, he married Albina L'Heureux. Pr\u00e9fontaine was president of the Carillon Agricultural Society, of the Carey Elevator Company and of the St. Pierre Trading Company.\n Pr\u00e9fontaine was first elected to the provincial parliament in 1903, running for Rodmond Roblin's governing Conservatives in the francophone riding of Carillon.  He was re-elected in 1907 and 1910.\n In 1914, Pr\u00e9fontaine lost his seat to Liberal Thomas Molloy by seven votes.  He was re-elected the following year, despite the disastrous showing of the Conservatives in the rest of the province.  His victory may be credited to the fact that the provincial Conservatives were seen as more supportive of francophone rights than were Tobias Norris's Liberals (indeed, Norris' government withdrew state funding for French-language education soon after the election).\n Conservative leader James Aikins lost his seat in the 1915 election, and Pr\u00e9fontaine was chosen to lead the small opposition caucus in parliament (he was sworn in as leader of the opposition in January 1916).  He declined to be a candidate in the party's leadership convention, held on November 6, 1919.\n Although it had been in government from 1900 to 1915, the Conservative Party of Manitoba was marginalized by developments in the later half of the 1910s.  Increasingly radicalized farmer and labour groups were forming political organizations of their own, and the old divisions between Grit and Tory no longer seemed as relevant.  The Conservatives again fared poorly in the election of 1920, and Pr\u00e9fontaine was personally defeated by Farmer candidate Maurice Duprey.\n After this loss, Pr\u00e9fontaine detached himself from the Conservative Party.  He ran as an Independent in the federal election of 1921, losing to Progressive candidate Arthur-Lucien Beaubien in the Provencher riding, and subsequently left the Conservatives to join the United Farmers of Manitoba.  Running as a UFM candidate, he was re-elected for Carillon in 1922.\n On December 3, 1923, Premier John Bracken appointed Pr\u00e9fontaine to the high-level cabinet positions of Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Railway Commissioner.

He was re-elected in that year's general election, and continued to serve the Franco-Manitoban community as a Minister without Portfolio until his death in 1935.\n Pr\u00e9fontaine's career reveals the continued importance of the francophone community to Manitoba politics, even after immigration from Ontario and Eastern Europe had significantly reduced their relative strength.  His decision to join the UFM was indicative of a larger cultural change, as Franco-Manitobans became an important part of the Progressive Party of Manitoba during its long period in government.\n His son Edmond also served in the Manitoba assembly.\n The resort community of Albert Beach, Manitoba (French: \"Plage Albert\") was named after him.",

Thornton was a Liberal, and served as a cabinet minister in the government or Tobias Norris.\n Thornton was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.  He was educated at Heriots School and the University of Edinburgh, receiving medical certification from the latter institution in 1884.  He moved to Canada in 1884, and received an LL.D. from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.

  "/wiki/Rodmond_Roblin": "Sir Rodmond Palen Roblin KCMG (February 15, 1853 \u2013 February 16, 1937) was a businessman and politician in Manitoba, Canada .\n Roblin was born in Sophiasburgh, in Prince Edward County, Canada West (later Ontario). The Roblin family was established in Sophiasburgh by Loyalist farmers Philip and Elizabeth Roblin from Smith's Clove (now known as Monroe) in Orange County, New York. He was educated at Albert College in Belleville, arrived in Winnipeg in 1877, and worked as a grain merchant.  Roblin served as reeve of Dufferin for five years and as warden for two, and was also a school trustee in the community.\n He entered provincial politics in the 1886 Manitoba election, running as a Liberal Party candidate against Conservative cabinet minister David H. Wilson in the constituency of Dufferin North.  He lost this race by five votes, but won a subsequent by-election held on May 12, 1888.\n The by-election took place shortly after Thomas Greenway was inaugurated as Manitoba's first Liberal premier.  Roblin was a supporter of Greenway in this period, and was re-elected by acclamation when the new premier called another provincial election for July 1888.\n Although Greenway's Liberals won this election with a landslide majority, the new premier was unable to fulfill a campaign promise for the development of local railways.  The Canadian Pacific Railway had lost its formal monopoly in the region, but it was still the dominant line and transportation costs remained high.  Confronted with Greenway's failure, Roblin abandoned the government in 1889 and caucused with the small Conservative opposition.  With the death of John Norquay in the same year, he emerged as the party's leading spokesman.  Roblin was the Conservative Party's de facto leader in the legislature between 1890 and 1892.\n In opposition, Roblin spoke against Greenway's proposed education reforms.  After his failure to reform the provincial railway system, Greenway repudiated an earlier pledge and withdrew state support for Manitoba's Catholic and francophone education system.  His reforms triggered a national political crisis, known as the Manitoba Schools Question.  While many Canadian francophones regarded Greenway's policy as discriminatory, it was extremely popular with Manitoba's anglophone and Protestant majority.  Greenway's government was re-elected in the 1892 election, and Roblin was personally defeated in the rural constituency including the town of Morden.\n Greenway won another landslide victory in the 1896 election, although Roblin was this time returned to the legislature for the constituency of Woodlands.  He became the parliamentary leader of the Conservatives for a second time, but stood aside to allow Hugh John Macdonald to become the official leader of the party in 1897.\n The 1899 provincial election very different from the previous two campaigns.  The schools question was resolved in 1896, and Greenway was forced to defend a fairly mediocre record on other issues against a more organized opposition.  The result was a narrow victory for Macdonald's Conservatives, who won 22 of 40 seats.  Macdonald was inaugurated as premier early in 1900.  Roblin, who was re-elected in Woodlands and was the main architect of the Conservative victory, was left out of cabinet.\n Macdonald resigned as premier on October 29, 1900, to run for the Conservative Party of Canada against Clifford Sifton in the federal riding of Brandon.  Roblin became premier in his place, and also took the powerful cabinet position of Railway Commissioner.  In December, he also appointed himself as Minister of Agriculture as well.  This consolidation of power reflected Roblin's personal authority over both the government and the provincial Conservative Party: his control over both would be unquestioned for the next fourteen years.\n While Greenway had won elections on single-issue populism, Roblin relied on \"machine politics\" for his electoral success.  Despite (or because of) some coercion, he was able to effectively dispense patronage and could rely on the support of many loyal followers at the community level.\n Roblin's Conservatives won thirty-one seats in the 1903 election, against nine for Greenway's Liberals.  The extent of this victory may be credited to Greenway's leadership of the Liberal Party\u2014he was increasingly uninterested in provincial politics, and was spending much of his time looking for a federal patronage appointment.  Roblin's machine also coasted to easy victories in 1907 and 1910, winning twenty-eight of forty-one seats on both occasions.\n Roblin played a crucial role in the 1911 federal election on reciprocity, by putting his electoral machine at the disposal of the federal Conservative Party.  In so doing, Roblin helped to defeat Sir Wilfrid Laurier and put Robert Borden in power.  Borden, in turn, enacted legislation to expand Manitoba's boundaries to their current limit.\n Like his counterpart James Whitney in Ontario, Roblin expanded the role of government in Manitoba and promoted many initiatives that would be regarded today as progressive.  As railway commissioner, he reached an agreement with Canadian Northern Railways to build an alternate route to the lakehead, and put control of the rates into the hands of the province.  His government also promoted significant expansions in health, education and road services, all of which were required to service Manitoba's rapidly increasing population.\n Roblin's Tories created Manitoba's first crown corporations, expropriating Bell's telephone services to create a state-owned system\u2014the first effective public utilities system in Canada. The government also started a state-owned system of grain elevators to assist farmers, but this was less successful.  A scandal involving these elevators weakened his government's hold on power in the early 1910s.\n Roblin was more conservative on social issues.  He is often remembered today for his opposition to women's suffrage, and for clashing with Nellie McClung on the issue.  McClung made Roblin appear foolish in her famous \"parliament of women\", parodying the premier's patronizing comments on traditional gender roles.  Roblin also resisted demands to enact a labour code to protect workers, and was sometimes reluctant to enforce the province's existing legislation.\n Roblin is also remembered for folding to pressure from Winnipeg's business community. In 1904 he took the appalling step of reducing the age minima for child labour, and increasing the maximum hours of work for women and children.\n Roblin's handling of the prohibition issue was also controversial.  Hugh John Macdonald's government passed prohibition legislation in 1900, after two separate referendums had confirmed public support for the initiative.  Roblin was reluctant to enforce the legislation, however, because his government received significant revenues from the sale of alcohol.  He called a third referendum in 1902.  When temperance supporters boycotted the poll, prohibition was defeated by a narrow margin.\n The 1914 provincial election was the start of a watershed period in Manitoba politics.  Roblin's government went into the election weakened by a scandal involving the construction of new legislative buildings.  His opponents accused the government of corruption, claiming misappropriation of funds and overspending.  The Conservatives were re-elected by a reduced margin, winning 28 seats against 20 for the Liberals in an expanded legislature.\n When Roblin rejected calls for a formal investigation into the legislative buildings scandal, the Liberal opposition petitioned the Lieutenant Governor to take direct action. The Lieutenant-Governor convened his own commission of enquiry, popularly known as the Mathers Commission as it was led by chief justice T.A. Mathers.  After only two weeks, the commission had uncovered enough evidence to force the government's resignation.  Roblin formally resigned as premier on May 12, 1915, and Liberal leader Tobias Norris was called to form a new administration.  A new general election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide..\n The commission report concluded that Roblin, Attorney General James H.

  "/wiki/Sigtryggur_Jonasson": "Sigtryggur Jonasson (February 8, 1852 \u2013 November 26, 1942) was a community leader and politician in Manitoba, Canada. He played a major part in establishing the Icelandic community in Manitoba. Jonasson served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1896 to 1899 and again from 1907 to 1910, as a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party.\n Jonasson was born to a farm family at Bakki in \u00d6xnadalur, Iceland, and was home-educated. He moved to Canada in 1872, and soon entered a profitable business partnership in Ontario. Appointed an immigration agent by the Ontario government in 1874, he succeeded in redirecting the flow of Icelandic immigration to Canada, most of his countrymen having previously gone to the United States. In 1875, he helped select an Icelandic reserve called New Iceland in Keewatin District, Northwest Territory, including the area around present-day Gimli. Jonasson was also instrumental in the founding of Framfari (Progress) in 1877, the first Icelandic-language newspaper on the North American continent.\n During a major exodus from New Iceland in 1879-1881, Jonasson established a sawmill and transportation company at Icelandic River (Riverton)in partnership with Fridjon Fridriksson, thus providing employment and stabilizing the settlement.  In 1881 New Iceland was incorporated into Manitoba and in 1887 residents adopted municipal government. Though he moved to Selkirk and later to Winnipeg to manage his business interests, Jonasson remained a strong supporter of the settlement, for which reason he became known as the 'Father of New Iceland'.  He was also instrumental in finally convincing CPR officials to extend the railway to Gimli in 1906, Arborg in 1910, and Riverton in 1914, and is thus responsible for the development of these thriving communities through the following decades. He was, along with Einar Hj\u00f6rleifsson Kvaran a key founder of the Icelandic newspaper L\u00f6gberg (Tribune), still published in Winnipeg in 2009, Jonasson also acted as the paper's editor from 1895 to 1901.\n He first campaigned for the Manitoba Legislature in the 1896 provincial election, and defeated his cousin, Conservative Party candidate Baldwin Baldwinson, by 79 votes in the St. Andrews constituency. The Liberal Party won this election under Thomas Greenway's leadership, and Jonasson served as a government backbencher for the next three years.\n Following redistribution, Jonasson campaigned in the 1899 election for the new constituency of Gimli, and lost to Baldwinson by eight votes. The Gimli election was deferred for a week after the rest of the province had voted, and a provincial Conservative majority had already been announced.\n The federal government of Wilfrid Laurier appointed Jonasson a Homestead Inspector for the Interlake District in 1901. He retained the post until 1906. He was then returned to the provincial assembly in the 1907 election, defeating Baldwinson by 156 votes. The Conservatives won this election, and Jonasson served for the next three years as an opposition member. He did not seek re-election in 1910.\n Jonasson helped to establish a co-operative agricultural marketing scheme for Icelandic farmers in 1907, and became the co-owner of a slaughterhouse in Winnipeg. The venture failed, and Jonasson was widely criticized in the Icelandic community for his role. He does not appear to have been wealthy in his later years.\n In 1930, Jonasson represented Canada at the millennium anniversary of Iceland's parliament.
