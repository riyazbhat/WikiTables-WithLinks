The series uses a serial format that has an ongoing storyline, with individual story arcs comprising each season. It premiered on 28 January 2004, becoming a ratings success in Italy and on Nickelodeon networks internationally.\n Iginio Straffi initially outlined the show's plot to last three seasons. He chose to continue the story for a fourth season in 2009. Around this time, Winx Club's popularity attracted the attention of the American media company Viacom, owner of Nickelodeon. Viacom purchased 30% of the show's animation studio, Rainbow SpA, and Nickelodeon became a co-producer of the series. Production on the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons was divided between Rainbow and Nickelodeon Animation Studio. To attract an American audience, Viacom assembled a voice cast of Nickelodeon actors (including Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande), invested US$100 million in advertising for the series, and inducted Winx Club into Nickelodeon's franchise of Nicktoons.\n Beginning in 2010, episodes of Winx Club have been jointly written with Nickelodeon's American team. Nickelodeon's writers aim to make the series multicultural and appealing toward viewers from different countries. In 2019, Straffi commented on his near-decade of collaboration with Nickelodeon, saying that \"the know-how of Rainbow and the know-how of Nickelodeon are very complementary; the sensibilities of the Americans, with our European touch.\" The continued partnership between Rainbow and Nickelodeon on Winx Club has led to the development of additional co-productions, including Club 57 in 2019, on which much of Winx Club's staff worked.\n The series was subject to budget cuts in 2014, during its seventh season.
