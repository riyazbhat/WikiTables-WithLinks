The farm is composed of the farmhouse and seven outbuildings, including corn cribs, a barn, a shed, a silo, and a milkhouse. The farm centers around the farmhouse, which was built in the Greek Revival style in 1826 by English immigrant James Elliott; even before Elliott joined the commune, the property had been associated with the followers of Robert Owen; the land had previously supported an offshoot of the main community, which its residents called Feiba Peveli. Elliott had settled in the vicinity as part of the Owenist commune that lived at New Harmony at that time; besides farming, Elliott established himself as the community's brewer. Among the distinctive architectural elements of the farmhouse are its two large chimneys, its symmetrical five-bay facade, and a porch with a gabled Greek Revival pediment. The front door sits at the middle of the first-floor facade, with two windows on each side; the second floor facade is similar, except that a window occupies the place of the front door. Although the Elliott Farm dates back nearly two hundred years, not all of its elements are original; one of the outbuildings was completed in 1938. Later in the twentieth century, the owners \u2014 still members of the Elliott family \u2014 took sustained action to restore and maintain the farm; this was one of many projects that they undertook at the time to preserve the buildings dating back to the time of the Harmony Society.",
