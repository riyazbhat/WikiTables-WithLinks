  "/wiki/Tripping_(song)": "Tripping is a song recorded by British singer Robbie Williams for his sixth studio album Intensive Care (2005).

Backed with the track Make Me Pure, also from the same album, it was sent to radio stations around the world.

During the chorus Williams reaches an extremely high disco-like head voice. Lyrically the song is a bit darker than previous songs. It tells the tale of gangsters and how they don't kill their own and they all love their mothers, before an anguished chorus of I've taken as much as I'm willing to take.",
