  "/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia": "The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), also known as SFR Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia, was a country located in Central and Southeastern Europe that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1992 amid the Yugoslav Wars. Covering an area of 255,804\u00a0km\u00b2 (98,766 sq mi), the SFRY was bordered by the Adriatic Sea and Italy to the west, Austria and Hungary to the north, Bulgaria and Romania to the east, and Albania and Greece to the south. The nation was a socialist state and a federation governed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and made up of six socialist republics \u2013 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia \u2013 with Belgrade as its capital. In addition, it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia: Kosovo and Vojvodina. The SFRY's origin is traced to 26 November 1942, when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II. On 29 November 1945, the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II, thus ending the monarchy. Until 1948, the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War, but after the Tito\u2013Stalin split of 1948, Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality. It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement, and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism. The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy. It was a founding member of CERN, the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, OSCE, IFAD, WTO, Eutelsat, and BTWC. Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980, the Yugoslav economy started to collapse, which increased unemployment and inflation. The economic crisis led to a rise in ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s; dissidence resulted among the multiple ethnicities within the constituent republics. With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, inter-republic talks on transformation of the federation into a confederacy also failed, with the two wealthiest republics (Croatia and Slovenia) seceding. In 1991 some European states recognized their independence. The federation collapsed along federal borders, followed by the start of the Yugoslav Wars, and the final downfall and breakup of the federation on 27 April 1992. Two of its republics, Serbia and Montenegro, remained within a reconstituted state known as the \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\", but this union was not recognized internationally as the official successor state to the SFRY. The term \"former Yugoslavia\" (biv\u0161a Jugoslavija/\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430) is now commonly used retrospectively.",

It was a predecessor of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina state, and existed between 1945 and 1992. It was subsequently given the higher status of a Socialist Republic, under strict terms of consociationalism known as \"ethnic key\" (Bosnian: nacionalni klju\u010d), based on the balance in the political representation of ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks). The capital city was Sarajevo, which remained the capital following independence. The Socialist Republic was dissolved in 1990 when it abandoned its socialist institutions and adopted liberal ones, as the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was, up to 20 December 1990, in the hands of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
  "/wiki/NK_Zagreb": "Nogometni klub Zagreb (English: Zagreb Football Club), commonly known as NK Zagreb or simply Zagreb (pronounced\u00a0[z\u00e2\u02d0\u0261reb]), is an amateur Croatian football club based in the Croatian capital city of Zagreb, currently playing in the \u010cetvrta HNL Center, which is a fourth tier league competition in the Croatian football league system. The club was founded in 1908 as H\u0160K Zagreb, meaning Hrvatski \u0160portski Klub Zagreb (English: Croatian Athletic Club Zagreb). In 2018 after managing Stadion Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva as their home ground since 1946 for 72 years, NK Zagreb was denied of new managing contract by the city's officials which in the end led to eviction from the venue in October 2018. So, as of 2018\u201319 season NK Zagreb is using their training camp ZAGREBello venue as a home ground for its official fixtures which is located in Vesla\u010dka street. The team's traditional home colours are white shirts, shorts and socks which is the reason why they are referred to as Bijeli in Croatian, meaning \"The Whites\". Another popular nickname of the club is \"The Poets\", Pjesnici in Croatian, due to their former location of home ground at Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva street which is named after Croatian poet Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107.",
