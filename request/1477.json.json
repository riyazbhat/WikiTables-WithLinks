The yuan (Chinese: \u5143; pinyin: yu\u00e1n) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts where \"Chinese yuan\" is widely used to refer to the renminbi.

One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiao (Chinese: \u89d2; pinyin: ji\u01ceo), and a jiao in turn is subdivided into 10 fen (Chinese: \u5206; pinyin: f\u0113n).
