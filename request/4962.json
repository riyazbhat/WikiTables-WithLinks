  "/wiki/South_Korea": "South Korea (Korean: \ud55c\uad6d/\u97d3\u570b; RR: Hanguk or literally \ub0a8\ud55c/\u5357\u97d3; RR: Namhan), officially the Republic of Korea (Korean: \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d/\u5927\u97d3\u6c11\u570b;  RR: Daehan Minguk) is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and sharing a land border with North Korea.\n The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo, which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great. Its capital, Seoul, is a major global city and half of South Korea's over 51 million people live in the Seoul Capital Area, the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world.\n The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131897). The succeeding Korean Empire was annexed into the Empire of Japan in 1910. After World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones, with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948. In 1950, a North Korean invasion began the Korean War and after its end in 1953, the country's economy began to soar, recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990. Authoritarian rule ended in 1987 and the country is now the most advanced democracy with the highest level of press freedom in Asia. South Korea is a member of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, the G20 and the Paris Club.\n South Korea is a highly developed country and the world's 12th-largest economy by nominal GDP. Its citizens enjoy the world's fastest Internet connection speeds and the most dense high-speed railway network along with the world's second-best healthcare system, resulting in the third highest health adjusted life expectancy in the world. The world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer, South Korea is a global leader in many technology and innovation driven fields. Since 2014, South Korea has been named the world's most innovative country by the Bloomberg Innovation Index for 6 consecutive years. Since the 21st century, South Korea has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture such as K-pop, TV dramas and cinema, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean Wave.",

  "/wiki/Unimog": "The Unimog, ([\u02c8\u028an\u026am\u0254k], listen (help\u00b7info)), is a range of multi-purpose all-wheel drive medium trucks produced by Daimler AG (formerly Daimler-Benz) and sold under the Mercedes-Benz brand. In the United States and Canada, the Unimog was sold as the Freightliner Unimog.\n Unimog production started in 1948 at Boehringer in G\u00f6ppingen. Daimler-Benz took over manufacture of the Unimog in 1951, and first produced it in the Mercedes-Benz Gaggenau plant. From 1951, the Unimog was sold under the Mercedes-Benz brand. However, the first Unimog to feature the three-pointed Mercedes-Benz star was only introduced in 1953. Since 2002, the Unimog has been built in the Mercedes-Benz truck plant in W\u00f6rth am Rhein in Germany. The Mercedes-Benz T\u00fcrk A.\u015e. plant assembles Unimogs in Aksaray, Turkey. Unimogs were also built in Argentina (first ever country to do so outside Germany) by Mercedes-Benz Argentina S.A. under licence from 1968 until 1983 (with some extra units built until 1991 off the assembly line from parts in stock) in the Gonz\u00e1lez Cat\u00e1n factory near the city of Buenos Aires.\n The first model was designed by Albert Friedrich and Heinrich R\u00f6\u00dfler shortly after World War II to be used in agriculture as a self-propelled machine providing a power take-off to operate saws in forests or harvesting machines on fields. It was designed with rear-wheel drive and switchable front-wheel drive, with equal-size wheels, in order to be driven on roads at higher speeds than standard farm tractors. With their very high ground clearance and a flexible frame that is essentially a part of the suspension, Unimogs are not designed to carry as much load as regular trucks.\n Due to their off-road capabilities, Unimogs can be found in jungles, mountains and deserts as military vehicles, fire fighters, expedition campers, and even in competitions like truck trials and Dakar Rally rally raids. In Western Europe, they are commonly used as snowploughs, municipal equipment carriers, agricultural implements, forest ranger vehicles, construction equipment or road\u2013rail vehicles and as army personnel or equipment carriers (in its armoured military version). New Unimogs can be purchased in one of two series: medium series 405, also known as the UGN (\"Ger\u00e4tetr\u00e4ger\" or equipment carrier),:4 and heavy series 437, also known as the UHN (\"Hochgel\u00e4ndeg\u00e4ngig\" or highly mobile cross country).",
