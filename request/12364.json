  "/wiki/Conant_Creek_Pegram_Truss_Railroad_Bridge": "The Conant Creek Pegram Truss Railroad Bridge, in Fremont County, Idaho near Grainville, Idaho and Ashton, Idaho, was built in 1894.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\n It now carries the Ashton-Tetonia Trail, and is known as the Conant Creek Trestle.\n It is a 780 feet (240\u00a0m) long bridge, spanning across four supporting steel towers, built to carry a single railroad track.  The towers, fabricated in 1911 by the American Bridge Company.  The two center towers are about 107 feet (33\u00a0m) high, and with 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) of truss above, the total distance from base to railroad bed is 137 feet (42\u00a0m).

The trusses were reinforced in 1916 with an additional, similar span along the centerline, manufactured by the American Bridge Company.  In 1927 the steel girders were put into place, replacing original 1911 timber Howe trusses;  these girders are believed to have been fabricated by Paxton & Verling Iron Works.\n The rails were removed when the line was abandoned, several years before the 1997 National Register listing.",

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_20": "U.S. Route 20 or U.S. Highway 20 (US\u00a020) is an east\u2013west United States highway that stretches from the Pacific Northwest all the way to New England. The \"0\" in its route number indicates that US\u00a020 is a coast-to-coast route and major route. Spanning 3,365 miles (5,415\u00a0km), it is the longest road in the United States, and the route is roughly parallel to that of the newer Interstate 90 (I-90), which is in turn the longest Interstate Highway in the U.S. There is a discontinuity in the official designation of US\u00a020 through Yellowstone National Park, with unnumbered roads used to traverse the park.\n US 20 and US\u00a030 break the general U.S. Route numbering rules in Oregon, since US\u00a030 actually starts north of US\u00a020 in Astoria, and runs parallel to the north throughout the state (the Columbia River and Interstate 84). The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell, Idaho. This is because US\u00a020 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US\u00a030 was. US\u00a020 originally ended at the eastern entrance of Yellowstone Park; it was extended in 1940.\n The highway's eastern terminus is in Boston, Massachusetts, at Kenmore Square, where it meets Route 2.
