Tampere has a population of 235,615 with the urban area holding 334,112 people and the metropolitan area, also known as the Tampere sub-region, holding 385,301 inhabitants in an area of 4,970 km2. Tampere is the second-largest urban area and third most-populous individual municipality in Finland, after the cities of Helsinki and Espoo and the most populous Finnish city outside the Greater Helsinki area, within which both Helsenki and Espoo are both located. Tampere is the major urban, economic, and cultural hub for central Finland. [citation needed]\n Tampere is wedged between two lakes, N\u00e4sij\u00e4rvi and Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi. Since the two lakes differ in level by 18 metres (59 ft), the rapids linking them, Tammerkoski, have been an important power source throughout history, most recently for generating electricity. Tampere is dubbed the Manchester of Finland for its industrial past as the former center of Finnish industry, and this has given rise to its Finnish nickname Manse and terms such as Manserock.",
