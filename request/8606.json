The format of the competition had changed from previous seasons, replacing that from the previous one after the defunction of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1999; an extra qualifying round was introduced, as was a group phase after the first round.  The group stage operated in a single round-robin format consisting of eight groups of five teams, each team plays two games at home and two away and the top three finishers of each group progress to the knock-out round, joining the eight third-placed teams from the UEFA Champions League group stage.",

Unless notified these statistics concern all seasons since inception of the UEFA Cup in the 1971\u201372 season, including qualifying rounds. The UEFA Cup replaced the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1971\u201372 season, so the Fairs Cup is not considered a UEFA competition, and hence clubs' records in the Fairs Cup are not considered part of their European record."
