  "/wiki/Eastern_chipmunk": "The eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) is a chipmunk species found in eastern North America. It is the only living member of the chipmunk subgenus Tamias, sometimes recognised as a separate genus.

  "/wiki/Sciuridae": "Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents.  Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.  The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene period and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among other living rodent families.",
  "/wiki/Groundhog": "The groundhog (Marmota monax), also known as a woodchuck, is a rodent of the family Sciuridae, belonging to the group of large ground squirrels known as marmots. It was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The groundhog is also referred to as a chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistlepig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk and, among French Canadians in eastern Canada, siffleux. The name \"thickwood badger\" was given in the Northwest to distinguish the animal from the prairie badger. Monax (M\u00f3onack) is an Algonquian name of the woodchuck, which meant \"digger\" (cf. Lenape monachgeu). Young groundhogs may be called chucklings.:66 Other marmots, such as the yellow-bellied and hoary marmots, live in rocky and mountainous areas, but the groundhog is a lowland creature. It is found through much of the eastern United States across Canada and into Alaska.",

Weaning occurs at 20\u201325 days, and females may mate at 30 days of age. Predators are those that prey on small mammals. One individual lived in captivity for about five years.  The mouse is of least concern to conservationists because it is abundant and widespread, and no major threats exist for the species as a whole, but several subspecies with small distributions are endangered or even extinct.",
