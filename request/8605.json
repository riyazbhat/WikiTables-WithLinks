Unless notified these statistics concern all seasons since inception of the UEFA Cup in the 1971\u201372 season, including qualifying rounds. The UEFA Cup replaced the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1971\u201372 season, so the Fairs Cup is not considered a UEFA competition, and hence clubs' records in the Fairs Cup are not considered part of their European record."
