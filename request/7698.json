The event was held at the Olympic Stadium on 3\u20135 August.\n The steeplechase has become a national event of Kenya.  Their team tactics dominate major championship races.  For the first 5 laps, they let others dominate the lead, primarily led by Americans Donald Cabral and Evan Jager.  Then the Kenyans decided to move as a team, leaving the field to chase.  With less than 800 metres to go, Ugandan Benjamin Kiplagat got tangled up on a barrier and fell flat on his face, the runners behind him having to scramble.  200 metres later, Kenyan Brimin Kipruto fell.  Though he quickly scrambled to his feet, that effectively ruined the chances for a Kenyan sweep.  Still the other two led through the final lap.  Former gold medalist and multiple world champion Ezekiel Kemboi pulled away off the front.  As Abel Mutai began to falter, Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad sprinted past to repeat his silver medal.  Kemboi's lead was secure and after clearing the final barrier, he began to celebrate, drifting out to lane 8 by the time he crossed the finish line.\n After the finish, Kemboi did the victory dance he has become known for.  He and Mekhissi-Benabbad exchanged jerseys and the diminutive Kemboi leaped into the much larger Mekhissi-Benabbad's arms.",

The reigning world junior champion Nigel Amos finished second in 1:41.73, establishing a new world junior record and Botswana national record. In an exceptionally fast final, all runners except Abubaker Kaki (who ran a seasonal best) set personal bests, including three national records (Kenya, Botswana, and Ethiopia). The finishing times were the fastest recorded for each placing and it constituted the first time that eight athletes ran under 1:44 in the same race. All the athletes in the race produced times that would have won the final in Beijing.  The eighth-place finisher, Andrew Osagie, produced a time that would have won the gold medal at all but three of the previous Olympic 800m finals.\n Rudisha led from the start of the race, easing from lane 4 to the break with a determined Kaki in tow.  By the halfway mark in 49.28 Mohammed Aman lined up off Kaki's shoulder.  During the next 200 meters, Rudisha put a gap on the field and Kaki began falling back.  The scramble was on to see who had anything left or, like Kaki, who would pay the price.  As Rudisha showed the strain of his effort, Nigel Amos and Timothy Kitum started to make up a little of the ground Rudisha had built up.  Running at the back of the field, Duane Solomon and Nick Symmonds made a late run, finishing just a step out of the medals.\n Amos' silver medal was the first Olympic medal ever for Botswana.",
