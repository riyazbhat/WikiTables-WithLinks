  "/wiki/Currency": "A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, \"in circulation\", from Latin: currens, -entis), in the most specific sense is money in any form when in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially for people in a nation. Under this definition, U.S. dollars (US$), euros (\u20ac), Japanese yen (\u00a5), and pounds sterling (\u00a3) are examples of currencies. These various currencies are recognized as stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.",

  "/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity": "Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a term that  measures prices in different areas using a specific good or goods to contrast the absolute purchasing power between different currencies. In many cases, PPP produces an inflation rate that is equal to the price of the basket of goods at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a different location. The PPP inflation and exchange rate may differ from the market exchange rate because of poverty, tariffs and other frictions. PPP exchange rates are widely used when comparing the GDP of different countries.",
