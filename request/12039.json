Since Vietnam is a single-party state, the President is generally considered to hold the second highest position in the political system, after the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. In addition, the president appoints the head of government, the Prime Minister. As head of state, the President represents Vietnam both domestically and internationally, and maintains the regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government and safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of the country. \n The President appoints the Vice President, Prime Minister, Ministers and other officials with the consent of the National Assembly. The President is furthermore the Supreme Commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces, Chairman of the Council for Defense and Security. Moreover, Member of Political Bureau, Standing Member of the Central Military Commission and the Central Police Party Committee. Since September 2011, the President is also the Head of the Central Steering Committee for Judicial Reform. The tenure of the President is five years, and a president can only serve three terms. If the President becomes unable to discharge duties of office, the Vice President assumes the office of acting president until the President resumes duty, or until the election of a new president.\n The powers and prestige of the office of President have varied over the years. For instance, while the inaugural president, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, was also the Chairman of the Communist Party, making him (in that capacity) the first ranking member of the Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam, his successor, T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng, served as a symbolic figure along with the General Secretary L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n. Since Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh's ascension to the presidency, the President has been ranked 1st (he was sometimes also chairman of the party) or 2nd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo except President Nguy\u1ec5n Minh Tri\u1ebft ranked fourth and President V\u00f5 Ch\u00ed C\u00f4ng ranked third. \n The current President is Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng, who was elected by the National Assembly in October 2018 after former President Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Quang died in office.

V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p is considered one of the greatest military strategists of the 20th century. He first grew to prominence during World War II, where he served as the military leader of the Viet Minh resistance against the Japanese occupation of Vietnam. Gi\u00e1p was a crucial military commander in two wars: the First Indochina War of 1946\u20131954, and the Vietnam War of 1955\u20131975, participating in several historically significant battles: L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n in 1950, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh in 1951\u20131952, \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 in 1954, the T\u1ebft Offensive in 1968, the Easter Offensive in 1972, and the final Ho Chi Minh Campaign of 1975.\n Gi\u00e1p had no direct military training and was a history teacher at a French-speaking academy, influenced by historical military leaders and personally citing T. E. Lawrence and Napoleon as his two greatest influences. \nHe would later earn the moniker \"Red Napoleon\" by some Western sources. \n Gi\u00e1p was also a journalist, an interior minister in President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's Vi\u1ec7t Minh government, the military commander of the Viet Minh, the commander of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), and a defense minister. He also served as a member of the Politburo of the Vietnam Workers' Party, which in 1976 became the Communist Party of Vietnam.\n Gi\u00e1p was a mastermind military builder; during the First Indochina War, he had transformed a rag-tag band of rebels to a 'fine light-infantry army' fielding cryptography, artillery and advanced logistics and capable of challenging a larger, modernised French Far East Expeditionary Corps and the Vietnamese National Army. He was also a very effective logistician, laying the foundation of the Ho Chi Minh trail, recognised as one of the great feats of military engineering of the 20th century.\n V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p served as Military Minister and Chief of Staff, and is often credited with North Vietnam's military victory over South Vietnam and the US during the Vietnam War. Recent scholarship indicates other leaders had played more prominent roles, with former subordinates and now rivals V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng and Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i assuming a more direct military responsibility than Gi\u00e1p. Nevertheless, he played a pivotal role in the second transformation of the PAVN into \"one of the largest, most formidable\" mechanised and combined-arms fighting force capable of delivering a knockout blow to an increasingly more powerful rival Army of the Republic of Vietnam in conventional warfare.",

The PAVN is a part of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and includes: Ground Force (including Strategic Rear Forces), Navy, Air Force, Border Defence Force, and Coast Guard. However, Vietnam does not have a separate Ground Force or Army branch. All ground troops, army corps, military districts and specialised arms belong to the Ministry of Defence, directly under the command of the Central Military Commission, the Minister of Defence, and the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. The military flag of the PAVN is the flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, with the words Quy\u1ebft th\u1eafng (Determination to win) added in yellow at the top left.\n During the French Indochina War (1946\u20131954), the PAVN was often referred to as the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. In the context of the Vietnam War (1955\u20131975), the army was referred to as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). This allowed writers, the U.S. military, and the general public, to distinguish northern communists from the southern communists, called Viet Cong or National Liberation Front. However, both groups ultimately worked under the same command structure. The Viet Cong was considered a branch of the VPA by the North Vietnamese. In 2010 the PAVN undertook the role of leading the 1,000th Anniversary Parade in Hanoi by performing their biggest parade in history.",

He rose in the party hierarchy in the late 1950s and became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam (VCP) at the 3rd National Congress in 1960. He continued H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's policy of ruling through collective leadership. From the mid-1960s (when H\u1ed3's health was failing) until his own death in 1986, he was the top decision-maker in Vietnam.\n He was born into a lower-class family in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province, in the southern part of French Indochina as L\u00ea V\u0103n Nhu\u1eadn. Little is known about his family and childhood. He first came in contact with revolutionary thoughts in the 1920s through his work as a railway clerk. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party (the future Communist Party of Vietnam) in 1930. He was imprisoned in 1931 and released in 1937. From 1937 to 1939, he climbed the party ladder. He was rearrested in 1939, this time for fomenting an uprising in the South. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was released from jail following the successful Communist-led August Revolution of August 1945.\n During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was an active revolutionary leader in South Vietnam. He headed the Central Office of South Vietnam, a Party organ, from 1951 until 1954. During the 1950s L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n became increasingly aggressive towards South Vietnam and called for reunification through war. By the mid-to-late 1950s L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n had become the second-most powerful policy-maker within the Party, eclipsing former party First Secretary Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh. By 1960 he was officially the second-most powerful Party member, after Party chairman H\u1ed3. Throughout the 1960s H\u1ed3's health declined and L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n assumed more of his responsibilities. On 2 September 1969 H\u1ed3 died and L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n became the most powerful figure in the North.\n He became the Party's First Secretary in 1960, officially becoming the main personality in the party after H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. After H\u1ed3's death, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n took over the leadership of North Vietnam. When South Vietnam was reunited with North Vietnam in 1976 and the party was restructured, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n became General Secretary of the Party. He endorsed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia of December 1978, aiming to overthrow the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge terror regime. This heavily impacted relations between Vietnam and China, with Vietnam responding with the deportation of ethnic Chinese and China carrying out a heavy-loss punitive expedition against Vietnam in 1979. From then on, Vietnam maintained a closer alliance with the Soviet Union and joined Comecon in 1978. L\u00ea remained General Secretary until his death in 1986. He died in Hanoi; his successor was initially Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh. L\u00ea Du\u1ea3n was also known as L\u00ea Dung, and was known in public as \"anh Ba\" (third brother).\n Throughout the Vietnam War of 1955 to 1975, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n took an aggressive posture. He saw attack as the key to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u20131980) failed and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam became internationally isolated during L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n's rule. In 1979, the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted the Khmer Rouge, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh.",

The General Secretaryship was the second-highest office within the party when H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was Chairman, a post which existed from 1951 to 1969.  The general secretary is also the Secretary of the Central Military Commission, the leading Party organ on military affairs. For a period in its history, the position of general secretary has been synonymous with the paramount leader of Vietnam. The current general secretary is Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng, and he is ranked first in the Politburo.\n Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa, one of the founding members of the Indochinese Communist Party, was the party's first general secretary. A year after being elected, he was sentenced to prison by the French authorities because of anti-French activities. He died in prison the same year. Tr\u1ea7n's de facto successor was L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Phong who led the party through the office of General Secretary of the Overseas Executive Committee (OEC). The OEC general secretary led the party because the Central Committee had been all but annihilated.

L\u00ea was elected general secretary in 1960, and was the second only to H\u00f4 until the latter's death on 2 September 1969.\n From 2 September 1969 until his death on 10 July 1986, L\u00ea was the undisputed leader of Vietnam. He died two months before the next National Party Congress, and was succeeded by Tr\u01b0\u1eddng, the former general secretary who had served as the second-most powerful politician in Vietnam since H\u00f4's death. Tr\u01b0\u1eddng was demoted from his post at the 6th National Party Congress, and was succeeded by Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh.

Linh resigned because of bad health in 1991, and \u0110\u1ed7 M\u01b0\u1eddi was appointed to the general secretaryship by the 7th National Congress. M\u01b0\u1eddi ruled until 1997, when he was ousted from power by the reformist-wing of the party. L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau was M\u01b0\u1eddi's successor, and he was elected as a compromise candidate. Phi\u00eau was ousted in 2001, before the 10th National Party Congress, when the Central Committee overturned a decision of the Politburo; a majority in the Central Committee voted to remove Phi\u00eau as general secretary.

  "/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Vietnam": "The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  (Vietnamese: Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ed9i n\u01b0\u1edbc C\u1ed9ng ho\u00e0 x\u00e3 h\u1ed9i ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a Vi\u1ec7t Nam) is Vietnam's legislative body.\n The Constitution of Vietnam recognizes the assembly as \"the highest organ of state power.\" The National Assembly, a 498-member unicameral body elected to a five-year term, meets twice a year. The assembly appoints the President (head of state), the Prime Minister (head of government), the Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, the Head of the Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam (or 'Supreme People's Office of Supervision and Inspection'), and the 21-member Government. Ultimately, however, the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV) has great influence over the executive and exercises control through the 150-member Central Committee, which elects the 15-member Politburo at national party congresses held every five years. Members of the party hold all senior government positions.\n Constitutionally, the National Assembly is the highest government organization and the highest-level representative body of the people. It has the power to draw up, adopt, and amend the constitution and to make and amend laws. It also has the responsibility to legislate and implement state plans and budgets. Through its constitution-making powers it defines its own role and the roles of the Vietnamese State President, the Vietnamese Government, the local people's councils and people's committees, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuracy. The assembly can elect and remove government ministers, the chief justice of the Supreme People's Court, and the procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuracy. Finally, it has the power to initiate or conclude wars and to assume other duties and powers it deems necessary. The term of each National Assembly is five years, and meetings are convened twice a year, or more frequently if called for by the National Assembly Standing Committee.\n Formerly, despite its many formal duties, the National Assembly existed mainly as a legislative arm of the Political Bureau (Politburo) of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). It converted Political Bureau resolutions into laws and decrees and mobilizes popular support for them. In this role, the National Assembly is led by the Council of Ministers acting through the Council of State and a variable number of special-purpose committees. Actual debate on legislation does not occur. Instead, a bill originates in the Council of Ministers, which registers the bill and assigns a key party member to present it on the floor. Before presentation, the member will have received detailed instructions from the party caucus in the assembly, which has held study sessions regarding the proposed legislation. Once the legislation is presented, members vote according to party guidelines.\n However, recently[when?], the National Assembly has gradually been more active and covered in Vietnam's political life. Although most legislation still originates from the government, such legislation is now more hotly debated in the National Assembly and attract a larger audience. As of 2009, the most debated legislation issues have included Vietnam's bauxite project in the Central Highlands and Vietnam's plan for new nuclear power stations in Ninh Thuan.",
