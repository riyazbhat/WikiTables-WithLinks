  "/wiki/Jordan_Russell": "Jordan Russell (born 6 November 1986) is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club and the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League.\n Russell was recruited as the number 9 draft pick in the 2004 AFL Draft from West Adelaide. He made his AFL debut for the Carlton Football Club in Round 15, 2005 against St Kilda, his only match for the year. He spent most of the season developing in Carlton's VFL-affiliate, the Northern Bullants. In 2006, he broke into the senior team, playing ten games, mostly off the bench.\n Russell expressed his desire to move back to South Australia for the 2007 season, with Port Adelaide seeking to trade for him, but no deal was made between the two clubs, and Russell re-signed with Carlton on 16 October 2006 to a two-year deal. In 2007, Russell played 18 games, but had not yet stamped himself as a definite future player.\n Under coach Denis Pagan, he struggled for game time, and usually played completely defensive tagging roles, with reasonable success. Pagan was replaced as coach by Brett Ratten in late 2007, and he began to play Russell in the midfield and half-forward line. He played 21 of 22 games in 2008, and earned another two-year contract.\n In 2009, Russell played 20 of 23 games, but was dropped briefly at midseason on form. This turned out to be a major turning point in Russell's career, as his form upon return to the seniors was outstanding. He continued his midfield/half-forward role for much of the year, but was forced into the back-line for the final month of the season after several injuries to teammates, where he was equally effective. Due to his strong form in the second half of the season, Russell finished sixth in the 2009 Carlton John Nicholls Medal.\n After his success in 2009, Russell continued to be used in two-way roles in the backline, and was a consistent contributor throughout 2010. He played every game, and also assumed responsibility for most of the kick-ins. Russell finished second behind Brownlow Medallist Chris Judd for the John Nicholls Medal.\n Russell underwent hip surgery during the 2011 pre-season, and struggled with fitness and form throughout the 2011 season; he was ultimately dropped to the VFL for the latter part of the year.\n Russell was delisted after the 2012 season after playing mostly in the VFL. Jordan Russell was picked up by Collingwood during the end of year trade as Carlton received pick 71 in return. Given the retirement of former Collingwood footballer Chris Tarrant, Russell was able to keep his number 2 guernsey that he'd previously had from his days at Carlton. Russell played nine games in his sole season with Collingwood, and was delisted at the end of the season.\n Russell joined the Footscray reserves in the Victorian Football League in 2014 as a VFL-listed player and a development coach, He was elevated to co-captain in 2015, then outright captain in 2016, and he captained the VFL state team against the SANFL in 2016. He captained the Bulldogs to two VFL premierships \u2013 the first in 2014 as the stand-in Grand Final captain, filling in for injured co-captains Nick Lower and Lukas Markovic, and the second as appointed captain in 2016.

  "/wiki/Ruckman_(Australian_rules_football)": "In Australian rules football, a ruckman or ruckwoman is typically a tall and athletic player who contests at centre bounces and stoppages (such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups).   The ruckman is one of the most important players on the field.  They are often key to coaching strategy and winning centre clearances which result in the most goal kicking opportunities (inside 50s).\n The role of the ruckman in Australian rules is similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out.  The key differences are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins, the ball is almost always thrown straight up high into the air rather than horizontally, so in this respect, the ruckman is similar to a basketball centre.  The ruckman needs to be able to control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms.  Unlike rugby, the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates. Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman.\n With no offside or knock on rules, the ruckman can tap the ball in any direction.  Before a bounce down or ball up, ruckmen confer with the onballers (rovers and ruck-rovers) to pre-determine the direction of the tap so that they can position themselves to best receive it to the team's advantage.\n The ruckman is typically the tallest player on either team.  A typical professional Australian Football League ruckman is over 200\u00a0cm or 6'7.\n When a ruckman beats his opponent by contacting the ball, it is called a hit out and measured as a statistic and performance indicator of effective ruckwork.   Although the ruckman is the primary player to score hit-outs, sometimes tall key position players fill in for the ruckman around the ground if the ruckman cannot run to make the contest in time.\n Rucking is one of the most physically demanding positions on the ground, both in terms of fitness and body contact.  As a result of the high level of physical contact of clashing with opponents in the air, many ruckmen have large physiques or bulk up to prevent injury.  As well, due to the use of knees when jumping, many ruckmen wear protective thigh and shin padding, whereas players in other positions rarely do.  Coaches often field more than one ruckman and rotate them due to the physical pressure of the position and the endurance of having to run to ruck contests around the ground.",

  "/wiki/Centre_half-forward": "In Australian rules football, the centre half-forward is a position on the half-forward line of a football field. The directly opposing player is a centre half-back. Wayne Carey of the North Melbourne and Adelaide football clubs is often considered to be the greatest centre half-forward of all time.\n The centre half-forward's role is usually the most demanding of any player on field, with a tall frame, strength and most importantly, athleticism, required. Usually the best backman will be used to cover a quality CHF, unless the opposing full-forward is so good they take priority. Thus, an attacking team with a solid combination of both centre half-forward and full-forward will seriously stretch a defence.\n If a team in the AFL played without a reliable centre half-forward, then they would often struggle to win games or make an impact on the competition. Great centre half-forwards have the ability to turn games on their heads and practically win a match singlehandedly for their team.\n A primary skill needed is good marking ability, with long-range goalkicking also being of great value. CHFs frequently line up shots on goal from about 50 metres out, often as wide as the boundary. At AFL level especially, kicking goals on-the-run while running into the 50-metre arc is a significant and requisite skill, as well as being able to pick out markers closer to the goal square.\n The position is very strenuous, and players who specialise as CHFs often have unnaturally shortened careers\u2014Dermott Brereton is a good example of a great player worn out too quickly. In the modern game, coaches preserve these players, playing them in a variety of relief positions, often in the opposite position at centre half-back; this typically preserves the longevity of their career. A good example is James Hird, who often played on the half-back flank towards the end of his career. While others may only play in CHF only when there is a more senior full forward ahead of them in the depth chart.",
