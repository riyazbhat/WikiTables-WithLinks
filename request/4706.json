  "/wiki/American_League_Park": "American League Park, known by historians as American League Park I, was a baseball park that formerly stood in Washington, D.C., at the corner of Florida Avenue and Trinidad Avenue NE on land previously belonging to the Washington Brick Company. It hosted the Washington Senators from the 1901 season through the 1903 season. On March 20, 1901, the district commissioners granted permission to the American League to establish a baseball park at the location following an application including plans and specifications for the grand stand and the other supporting structures. Snowden Ashford was the building inspector who handled the case. The land had been previously occupied by the Washington Brick Company in an area sparsely built at the time; the closest buildings were located more than 50 feet (15 m) from the outlines of the grounds. Therefore, it was considered that it would not cause more menace to the area then if a lumber yard was established there. No specific regulations for the establishment of baseball grounds were in place in the District of Columbia at the time. No opposition from nearby landowners was received, therefore permission was granted.",
