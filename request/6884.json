  "/wiki/Pincho": "A pincho (Spanish: [\u02c8pint\u0283o]; literally thorn or spike), pintxo (Basque: [pint\u0283o]) or pinchu (Asturian: [\u02c8pint\u0283\u028a]) is a small snack, typically eaten in bars, traditional in northern Spain and especially popular in La Rioja, Cantabria, Asturias, the Basque country and Navarra. They are usually eaten in bars or taverns as a small snack while hanging out with friends or relatives; thus, they have a strong socializing component, and in the Basque country and Navarre they are usually regarded as a cornerstone of local culture and society. They are related to tapas, the main difference being that pinchos are usually 'spiked' with a skewer or toothpick, often to a piece of bread. They are served in individual portions and always ordered and paid for independently from the drinks. It is not impossible, however, to have the same item called pincho in one place and tapa in another. They are called pinchos because many of them have a pincho (Spanish for spike), typically a toothpick \u2014or a skewer for the larger varieties\u2014 through them. They should not be confused with brochettes, which in Latin America and some parts of Spain are called pinchos too; in brochettes, the skewer or toothpick is needed in order to cook the food or keep it together.",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine": "Mediterranean cuisine is the foods and methods of preparation by people of the Mediterranean Basin region. The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer Elizabeth David's book, A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950), though she wrote mainly about French cuisine. She and other writers including the Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid define the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding olive oil, bread and pasta, and wine; other writers emphasize the diversity of the region's foods and deny that it is a useful concept. The geographical area covered broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree, as noted by David and Essid. The region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the  Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Proven\u00e7al (French), and Spanish. However, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta), and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean. The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products.",

  "/wiki/Shortbread": "Shortbread is a traditional Scottish biscuit (cookie in American English) usually made from one part white sugar, two parts butter, and three parts plain wheat flour. Other ingredients like ground rice or cornflour are sometimes added to alter the texture. Modern recipes also often deviate from the original by splitting the sugar into equal parts granulated and icing sugar and many add a portion of salt. Shortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word short). The cause of this texture is its high fat content, provided by the butter. The short or crumbly texture is a result of the fat inhibiting the formation of long protein (gluten) strands. The related word shortening refers to any fat that may be added to produce a short (crumbly) texture. Alternatively, the name may be derived from 'shorts', the bran and coarse part of meal.",
