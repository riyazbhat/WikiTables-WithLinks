  "/wiki/Gotthard_Rail_Tunnel": "The Gotthard Tunnel (German: Gotthardtunnel, Italian: Galleria del San Gottardo) is a 15-kilometre-long (9.3 mi) railway tunnel and forms the summit of the Gotthard Railway in Switzerland. It connects G\u00f6schenen with Airolo and was the first tunnel through the Saint-Gotthard Massif in order to bypass the St Gotthard Pass. It is built as one double-track, standard gauge tunnel. When opened in 1882, the Gotthard Tunnel was the longest tunnel in the world.\n The tunnel rises from the northern portal at G\u00f6schenen (1,106 m (3,629 ft)) and the highest point (1,151 m (3,776 ft)) is reached after approximately 8 kilometres (5.0 mi). After two more kilometers, the border between the cantons of Uri and Ticino is passed; after another 5 kilometres (3.1 mi), the tunnel ends at the southern portal near to Airolo (1,142 m (3,747 ft)). The trip takes about seven to eight minutes by train. Services are operated by the Swiss Federal Railways.",
  "/wiki/Ticino": "The canton of Ticino (/t\u026a\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0no\u028a/), formally the Republic and Canton of Ticino,[a] is the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Ticino borders the canton of Uri to the north, the canton of Valais to the west (through the Novena Pass), the canton of Graub\u00fcnden to the northeast, Italy's regions of Piedmont and Lombardy to the south and it surrounds the small Italian enclave of Campione d'Italia.\n Named after the river Ticino, it is the only canton where Italian is the sole official language and represents the bulk of the Italian-speaking area of Switzerland along with the southern parts of Graub\u00fcnden.\n The land now occupied by the canton was annexed from Italian cities in the 15th century by various Swiss forces in the last transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy. In the Helvetic Republic, established 1798, it was divided between the two new cantons of Bellinzona and Lugano. The creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803 saw these two cantons combine to form the modern canton of Ticino.",

It connects the Landquart\u2013Davos Platz and the Bever\u2013Scuol-Tarasp lines. At 19,042 metres (62,474 ft) in length, the Vereina Tunnel is the longest tunnel on the Swiss Rhaetian Railway (RhB) network as well as the world's longest metre-gauge railway tunnel. The tunnel was built to improve all-weather transport links in the eastern part of Canton Graub\u00fcnden, as the Fl\u00fcela Pass (between Davos and Susch) is prone to heavy snowfall and avalanches in the winter months. Construction began in 1991 and the tunnel opened to traffic November 19, 1999. The total cost of the tunnel came to CHF 812 million. Service is based on hourly regional trains between Scuol-Tarasp and Chur, complemented every 30 minutes by car shuttle trains transporting road vehicles between the two valleys linked via the tunnel and by freight trains. The tunnel is single track, with passing loops (each two km long) in the middle and near the two portals.",

The city was founded in 1656. Its growth and prosperity is mainly bound up with the watch-making industry. It is the most important centre of the watch making industry in the area known as the Watch Valley. Partially destroyed by a fire in 1794, La Chaux-de-Fonds was rebuilt following a grid street plan, which was and is still original among Swiss cities, the only exception being the easternmost section of the city, which was spared of fire. This creates an interesting and obvious transition from the old section to the newer section.",
