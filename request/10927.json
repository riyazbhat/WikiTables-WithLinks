  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha (sometimes called cha-cha), is a dance of Cuban origin. It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance. In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated.",
