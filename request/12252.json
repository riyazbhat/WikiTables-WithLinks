After obtaining the identifying information of the adults who are seeking sexual contact with minors (the adult seeking the minor may offer their telephone number or other details so that a meeting can be arranged), the organization would then pass the information on to law enforcement. Perverted-Justice's methods are controversial, and critics have labeled these actions harassment and possibly legal entrapment.
