  "/wiki/Hour": "An hour (symbol: h; also abbreviated hr.) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as \u200b1\u204424 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599\u20133,601 seconds, depending on conditions. The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of \u200b1\u204412 of the night or daytime. Such seasonal, temporal, or unequal hours varied by season and latitude. Medieval astronomers such as al-Biruni and Sacrobosco, subsequently divided the hour into 60 minutes, each of 60 seconds. (This derives from Babylonian astronomy, where the corresponding terms denoted the time required for the Sun's apparent motion through the ecliptic to describe one minute or second of arc, respectively. In present terms, the Babylonian degree of time was thus four minutes long, the \"minute\" of time was thus four seconds long and the \"second\" 1/15 of a second.) Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as \u200b1\u204424 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it \u200b1\u204424 of the mean solar day.",
  "/wiki/Minute": "The minute is a unit of time usually equal to \u200b1\u204460 (the first sexagesimal fraction) of an hour, or 60 seconds. In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system). Although not an SI unit, the minute is accepted for use with SI units. The SI symbol for minute or minutes is min (without a dot). The prime symbol is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/Second": "The second (symbol: s, abbreviation: sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI), commonly understood and historically defined as \u200b1\u204486400 of a day \u2013 this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each. Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds (and minutes), and a \"second hand\" to mark the passage of time in seconds. Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for velocity, meters per second per second for acceleration, and cycles per second for frequency. Although the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth's rotation cycle, the formal definition in the International System of Units (SI) is  a much steadier timekeeper: it is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency \u2206\u03bdCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s\u22121. Because the Earth's rotation varies and is also slowing ever so slightly, a leap second is periodically added to clock time[nb 1] to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation. Multiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes. Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths.",

Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago, humanity spread all over the Old World, and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens. Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity.
