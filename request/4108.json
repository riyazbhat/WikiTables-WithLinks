  "/wiki/Acre": "The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to 10 square chains, \u200b1\u2044640 of a square mile, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047 m2, or about 40% of a hectare. Based upon the International yard and pound agreement of 1959, an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres. An internationally recognised symbol for the acre is ac.\n The acre is a statute measure in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in almost all countries of the former British Empire: in most it is lawful to 'use for trade' if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration.\n In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only two parts per million: see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. \n Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, an acre was defined  as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen.",
  "/wiki/Hectare": "The hectare (/\u02c8h\u025bkt\u025b\u0259r, -t\u0251\u02d0r/; SI symbol: ha) is a non-SI metric unit of area equal to a square with 100-metre sides (1 hm2), or 10,000 m2, and is primarily used in the measurement of land. There are 100 hectares in one square kilometre. An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres.\n In 1795, when the metric system was introduced, the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare (\"hecto-\" + \"are\") was thus 100 ares or \u200b1\u2044100 km2 (10,000 square metres). When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960, resulting in the International System of Units (SI), the are was not included as a recognised unit. The hectare, however, remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is \"expected to continue indefinitely\". Though the dekare/decare daa (1,000 m2) and are a (100 m2) are not officially \"accepted for use\", they are still used in some contexts.",
  "/wiki/Backbone_State_Forest": "Backbone State Park is Iowa's oldest state park, dedicated in 1919.  Located in the valley of the Maquoketa River, it is approximately three miles (5 km) south of Strawberry Point in Delaware County.  It is named for a narrow and steep ridge of bedrock carved by a loop of the Maquoketa River originally known as the Devil's Backbone.  The initial 1,200 acres (490 ha) were  donated by E.M. Carr of Lamont, Iowa. Backbone Lake Dam, a relatively low dam built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s, created Backbone Lake. The CCC constructed a majority of trails and buildings which make up the park.",
