These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them Gram-positive stains, but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to Gram-negative bacteria. Deinococcus survive when their DNA is exposed to high doses of gamma and UV radiation. Whereas other bacteria change their structure in the presence of radiation, such as by forming endospores, Deinococcus tolerate it without changing their cellular form and do not retreat into a hardened structure. They are also characterized by the presence of the carotenoid pigment deinoxanthin that give them their pink color. They are usually isolated according to these two criteria.",
  "/wiki/Deinococcus_deserti": "Deinococcus deserti is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Deinococcaceae, a group of extremely radiotolerant bacteria. D. deserti and other Deinococcaceae exhibit an extraordinary ability to withstand ionizing radiation.",
  "/wiki/Deinococcales": "Deinococcus\u2013Thermus is a phylum of bacteria that are highly resistant to environmental hazards, also known as extremophiles. These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them gram-positive stains, but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to those of gram-negative bacteria. Cavalier-Smith calls this clade Hadobacteria (from Hades, the Greek underworld).",
  "/wiki/Deinococcus_geothermalis": "Deinococcus geothermalis is a bacterium. It produces orange-pigmented colonies and has an optimum growth temperature of about 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) to 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F). It is extremely gamma radiation-resistant. Its type strain is AG-3a (= DSM 11300). A space mission called EXPOSE-R2 was launched on 24 July 2014 aboard the Russian Progress M-23M, and was attached on 18 August 2014 outside the ISS on the Russian module Zvezda. The two main experiments will test the resistance of a variety of extremophile microorganisms, including Deinococcus geothermalis to long-term exposure to outer space and to a Mars simulated environment.",
  "/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans": "Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremophilic bacterium, one of the most radiation-resistant organisms known. It can survive cold, dehydration, vacuum, and acid, and is therefore known as a polyextremophile and has been listed as the world's toughest bacterium in The Guinness Book Of World Records.",

  "/wiki/Thermus_thermophilus": "Thermus thermophilus is a Gram negative bacterium used in a range of biotechnological applications, including as a model organism for genetic manipulation, structural genomics, and systems biology. The bacterium is extremely thermophilic, with an optimal growth temperature of about 65 \u00b0C (149 \u00b0F). Thermus thermophilus was originally isolated from a thermal vent within a hot spring in Izu, Japan by Tairo Oshima and Kazutomo Imahori. The organism has also been found to be important in the degradation of organic materials in the thermogenic phase of composting. T. thermophilus is classified into several strains, of which HB8 and HB27 are the most commonly used in laboratory environments. Genome analyses of these strains were independently completed in 2004.",
