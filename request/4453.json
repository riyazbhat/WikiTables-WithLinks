  "/wiki/NY_52": "New York State Route\u00a052 (NY\u00a052) is a 108.72-mile-long (174.97\u00a0km) state highway in the southeastern part of the state. It generally runs from west to east through five counties, beginning at the Pennsylvania state line in the Delaware River near Narrowsburg, crossing the Hudson River on the Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge, and ending in Carmel. NY\u00a052 and NY\u00a055, both major east\u2013west routes of the Mid-Hudson Region, run parallel to each other, intersecting in downtown Liberty.\n With the exception of the section overlapping Interstate\u00a084 (I-84), most of Route\u00a052 is a two-lane road through lightly developed rural areas. The road west of the Hudson River serves a number of small communities in the southern Catskills and Hudson Valley, such as the villages of Jeffersonville, Ellenville and Walden. East of the Hudson, it closely parallels I-84 after leaving it at the village of Fishkill. It once passed through the cities of Newburgh and Beacon, following a ferry between them, but since the bridge's construction Route\u00a052 runs concurrently with I-84 just to their north.\n Much of what is today Route\u00a052 was built as private turnpikes in the early 19th century. After their operating companies folded later in the century, the state took over the roads in the 1890s. While some portions of today's Route 52 were included in New York's first designations of state highways, it was not until a 1930 renumbering that Route\u00a052 took that number.\n At that time it followed most of its present alignment, but continued east of its present terminus to NY 22. The truncation to its junction with US 6 in Carmel came later in the 1930s, along with an exchange of alignments between routes 52 and 216. When the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge was opened in the early 1960s, Route\u00a052 was rerouted onto I-84, bypassing a route to the ferry landings in Newburgh and Beacon. The alignment to I-84 in the latter city is today Route\u00a052 Business.",

  "/wiki/NY_42": "New York State Route\u00a042 (NY\u00a042) is a north\u2013south, discontinuous state highway in the Catskill Mountains region of New York in the United States. The southernmost of the highway's two segments begins at an intersection with U.S. Route\u00a06 (US\u00a06) and US\u00a0209 in Port Jervis and ends at a junction with NY\u00a055 near the Rondout Reservoir in Neversink. NY\u00a042's northern segment runs from NY\u00a028 in Shandaken to NY\u00a023A in Lexington. The 41-mile (66\u00a0km) southern segment is located in Orange County and Sullivan County, while the 11-mile (18\u00a0km) northern segment is in Ulster County and Greene County.\n NY\u00a042 is one of three state routes in New York that is split into two segments; the others are NY\u00a024 and NY\u00a0878, both located on Long Island. Like NY\u00a024, NY\u00a042 was a continuous route when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The portion of the route between Neversink and Shandaken was eliminated in the mid-1930s.",

All roads maintained by Ulster County are assigned a county highway (CH) number; this number is posted on small green signs placed below the route marker but is otherwise unsigned.

  "/wiki/NY_17": "New York State Route\u00a017 (NY\u00a017) is a major state highway that extends for 397 miles (638.91\u00a0km) through the Southern Tier and Downstate regions of New York in the United States. It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and follows the Southern Tier Expressway east through Corning to Binghamton and the Quickway from Binghamton east to Woodbury, where it turns south to follow the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern, where it connects to  New Jersey Route 17. From the Pennsylvania border to the village of Waverly and from Binghamton to Windsor, NY\u00a017 is concurrent with Interstate\u00a086 (I-86). Eventually, the entire east\u2013west portion of NY\u00a017 from the Pennsylvania border to Woodbury will become I-86 as projects to upgrade the route to Interstate Highway standards are completed.\n At 397\u00a0miles, NY\u00a017 is the longest state route in New York, and its second-longest highway of any kind besides the Thruway. It serves 11 counties (Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Allegany, Steuben, Chemung, Tioga, Broome, Delaware, Sullivan, Orange, and Rockland), passes through the cities of Salamanca, Olean, Corning, Elmira, and Binghamton, and enters the vicinity of several others, including Jamestown and Middletown. As it proceeds across the state, it intersects many of New York's Interstate and U.S. Highways, including U.S. Route\u00a0219 (US\u00a0219) in Salamanca, I-99 and US\u00a015 near Corning, I-81 in Binghamton, and I-84 near Middletown. The portion of NY\u00a017 in the vicinity of Waverly is actually located in Pennsylvania; however, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).\n The route was assigned in 1924, extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways. It was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1980s. Two of NY\u00a017's suffixed routes, NY\u00a017C and NY\u00a017M, follow substantial portions of NY\u00a017's pre-freeway alignment. In 1998, all of NY\u00a017 between the Pennsylvania state line and Harriman was designated as \"Future I-86\". The westernmost 177 miles (285\u00a0km) of the route was designated as I-86 one year later, and the designation has been gradually extended eastward as sections of NY\u00a017 were improved to Interstate Highway standards. Prior to the I-86 designation, NY\u00a017 was part of a 3-state Route 17 along with New Jersey Route 17 and the former Pennsylvania Route 17 (PA\u00a017).",

  "/wiki/List_of_county_routes_in_Sullivan_County,_New_York": "County routes in Sullivan County, New York, are maintained by the Sullivan County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon route marker. The county highway system comprises roughly 140 routes arranged across the county in groups of nine. For the most part, state routes in Sullivan County are county-maintained and co-signed with county routes. However, the converse is not true; that is, not all county routes overlap state routes for their entire length. Typically, each series consists of county routes along a single roadway, often overlapping with state highways in the process. The lowest numbered route in the system is County Route\u00a011 (CR\u00a011); the highest is CR\u00a0183C. Note that routes 160 through 169 do not conform to any style, and coincidentally the 170 through 179 series (with the exception of the spur designated 174A) follows the pre-expressway routing of New York State Route\u00a017 (NY\u00a017).\n Sullivan County posted signage of their routes in\u00a01958."
