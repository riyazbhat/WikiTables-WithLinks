  "/wiki/Haitian_Creole_language": "Haitian Creole (/\u02c8he\u026a\u0283\u0259n \u02c8kri\u02d0o\u028al/) is a French-based creole language spoken by 10\u201312 million people worldwide, and the only language of most Haitians. It is called krey\u00f2l ayisyen or just krey\u00f2l ([k\u0263ej\u0254l]) by its speakers, and cr\u00e9ole ha\u00eftien in Standard French. The language emerged from contact between French settlers and enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Although its vocabulary is mostly taken from 18th-century French, it also has influences from Portuguese, Spanish, English, Ta\u00edno, and West African languages. It is not mutually intelligible with standard French, and has its own distinctive grammar. Haitians are the largest community in the world speaking a modern creole language. Usage of, and education in, Haitian Creole has been contentious since at least the 19th century; some Haitians view French as a legacy of colonialism, while Creole was maligned by francophones as a miseducated person's French. Until the late 20th century, Haitian presidents spoke only standard French to their fellow citizens, and until the 2000s, all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in modern standard French, a second language to most of the students.",
  "/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Haiti": "An arrondissement (French pronunciation: [a\u0281\u0254\u0303dism\u0251\u0303] (listen)) is a level of administrative division in Haiti. As of 2015[update], the 10 departments of Haiti were divided into 42 arrondissements. Arrondissements are further divided into communes and communal sections. The term arrondissement can be roughly translated into English as district. A more etymologically precise, but less allegorical, definition would be encirclements, from the French arrondir, to encircle. Because no single translation adequately conveys the layered sense of the word, the French term is usually used in English writing. The Arrondissements are listed below, by department:",

It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749. The city's layout is similar to that of an amphitheatre; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area's population at around 3.7 million, nearly half of the country's national population.

  "/wiki/Mass_grave": "A mass grave is a grave containing multiple human corpses, which may or may not be identified prior to burial. The United Nations has defined a criminal mass grave as a burial site containing three or more victims of execution. Mass graves are usually created after many people die or are killed, and there is a desire to bury the corpses quickly for sanitation concerns. Although mass graves can be used during major conflicts such as war and crime, in modern times they may be used after a famine, epidemic, or natural disaster. In disasters, mass graves are used for infection and disease control. In such cases, there is often a breakdown of the social infrastructure that would enable proper identification and disposal of individual bodies."
