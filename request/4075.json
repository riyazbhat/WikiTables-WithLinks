A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia. He was the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a turncoat, as the Party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the National Government coalition that Snowden supported.

  "/wiki/T._Russell_Williams": "Thomas Russell Williams (1869 - 1926) was a British socialist politician. Williams grew up in Huddersfield and largely educated himself. He entered the textile industry and rose to become manager of a mill. He tried to enter the civil service, but was rejected, and instead turned his attention to the trade union movement. He became interested in ethical socialism and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), serving on its national council, though never becoming a figure well-known to the public. Williams stood as the Labour Representation Committee candidate for Huddersfield at the 1906 general election. He was initially selected by the local trades council, and only later gained the backing of the ILP, against the private wishes of Ramsay MacDonald. He believed that he had a strong chance of winning the seat, but ultimately took a close second place, with 35.2% of the vote, on an extremely high turnout of 94% of eligible voters. Williams stood again at the 1906 Huddersfield by-election, for the renamed Labour Party, but again lost narrowly, his vote dropping slightly to 33.8%. Although blaming this on the disqualification of some working class voters, he also admitted that the party had failed to make new converts. Williams lost further favour with the ILP leadership after he endorsed Victor Grayson in his successful independent labour campaign at the 1907 Colne Valley by-election. However, he was selected for Spen Valley, taking 23.3% of the vote at the January 1910 general election.",

  "/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald": "James Ramsay MacDonald FRS (n\u00e9 James McDonald Ramsay; 12 October 1866 - 9 November 1937) was a British statesman who was the first Labour Party politician to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, leading minority Labour governments for nine months in 1924 and then in 1929-31. From 1931 to 1935, he headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party and supported by only a few Labour members. MacDonald was later vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found. MacDonald, along with Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party. He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and, after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War, he was Leader of the Labour Party from 1922. The second Labour Government (1929-31) was dominated by the Great Depression. He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the gold standard, but it had to be abandoned after the Invergordon Mutiny, and he called a general election in 1931 seeking a doctor's mandate to fix the economy. The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons. His health deteriorated and he stood down as Prime Minister in 1935, remaining as Lord President of the Council until retiring in 1937. He died later that year. MacDonald's speeches, pamphlets and books made him an important theoretician. Historian John Shepherd states that MacDonald's natural gifts of an imposing presence, handsome features and a persuasive oratory delivered with an arresting Highlands accent made him the iconic Labour leader.",

With a background in preaching, he became known as a talented public speaker and was chosen as a spokesman for his fellow miners. In 1879, Hardie was elected leader of a miners' union in Hamilton and organised a National Conference of Miners in Dunfermline. He subsequently led miners' strikes in Lanarkshire (1880) and Ayrshire (1881). He turned to journalism to make ends meet, and from 1886 was a full-time union organiser as secretary of the Ayrshire Miners' Union. Hardie initially supported William Gladstone's Liberal Party, but later concluded that the working class needed its own party. He first stood for parliament in 1888 as an independent, and later that year helped form the Scottish Labour Party. Hardie won the English seat of West Ham South as an independent candidate in 1892, and helped to form the Independent Labour Party (ILP) the following year.

Around the mid-1890s, he became a socialist and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP).
