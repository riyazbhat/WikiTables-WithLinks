  "/wiki/Jacob_Pavlovitch_Adler": "Jacob Pavlovich Adler (born Yankev P. Adler; February 12, 1855 \u2013 April 1, 1926) was a Jewish actor and star of Yiddish theater, first in Odessa, and later in London and in New York City's Yiddish Theater District. Nicknamed nesher hagodol, (the Great Eagle, Adler being the Yiddish for eagle), he achieved his first theatrical success in Odessa, but his career there was rapidly cut short when Yiddish theater was banned in Russia in 1883. He became a star in Yiddish theater in London, and in 1889, on his second voyage to the United States, he settled in New York City. Adler soon started a company of his own, ushering in a new, more serious Yiddish theater, most notably by recruiting the Yiddish theater's first realistic playwright, Jacob Gordin. Adler scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin's Der Yiddisher King Lear (The Jewish King Lear), set in 19th-century Russia, which along with his portrayal of Shakespeare's Shylock would form the core of the persona he defined as the Grand Jew. Nearly all his family went into theater; probably the most famous was his daughter Stella, who taught method acting to, among others, Marlon Brando.",

She also played male roles, including Shakespeare's Hamlet. Rostand called her the queen of the pose and the princess of the gesture, while Hugo praised her golden voice. She made several theatrical tours around the world, and was one of the first prominent actresses to make sound recordings and to act in motion pictures.",

  "/wiki/Harry_Houdini": "Harry Houdini (/hu\u02d0\u02c8di\u02d0ni/; born Erik Weisz, later Ehrich Weiss or Harry Weiss; March 24, 1874 \u2013 October 31, 1926) was a Hungarian-born American illusionist and stunt performer, noted for his sensational escape acts. He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the US and then as Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it. In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.",

She was best known for her performance in the melodrama Mazeppa, with a climax that featured her apparently nude and riding a horse on stage.

After a brief trip back to the United States, she returned to Europe. However, she became ill within two years and died in Paris at the age of 33. Menken told many versions of her origins, including her name, place of birth, ancestry, and religion, and historians have differed in their accounts.

Thomashefsky was born in Ositniashka (\u041e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044f\u0436\u043a\u0430) a village in the Kiev Governorate in the Russian Empire, and grew up in the neighboring town Kamianka (today in the Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine). At the age of 11, he left for Berdichev (Berdychiv, Ukraine), where he trained as a meshoyrer (choir singer) in the renowned synagogue choir of cantor Nisan Belzer. In 1881, he emigrated with his family to the United States, and just a year later, while still a teenager, he was largely responsible for the first performance of Yiddish theatre in New York City, in what was to become the Yiddish Theater District. He has been credited as the pioneer of Borscht Belt entertainment. Although Thomashefsky left Imperial Russia at a time when Yiddish theater was still thriving there (it was banned in September 1883), he had never actually seen it performed prior to the 1882 performance he brought together in New York. Thomashefsky, who was earning some money by singing on Saturdays at the Henry Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, was also working as a cigarette maker in a sweatshop, where he first heard songs from the Yiddish theater, sung by some of his fellow workers.",
