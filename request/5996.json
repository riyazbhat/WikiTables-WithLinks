  "/wiki/Jacob_Pavlovitch_Adler": "Jacob Pavlovich Adler (born Yankev P. Adler; February 12, 1855 \u2013 April 1, 1926) was a Jewish actor and star of Yiddish theater, first in Odessa, and later in London and in New York City's Yiddish Theater District.\n Nicknamed \"nesher hagodol\", (\"the Great Eagle\", Adler being the Yiddish for \"eagle\"), he achieved his first theatrical success in Odessa, but his career there was rapidly cut short when Yiddish theater was banned in Russia in 1883. He became a star in Yiddish theater in London, and in 1889, on his second voyage to the United States, he settled in New York City. Adler soon started a company of his own, ushering in a new, more serious Yiddish theater, most notably by recruiting the Yiddish theater's first realistic playwright, Jacob Gordin. Adler scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin's Der Yiddisher King Lear (The Jewish King Lear), set in 19th-century Russia, which along with his portrayal of Shakespeare's Shylock would form the core of the persona he defined as the \"Grand Jew\".\n Nearly all his family went into theater; probably the most famous was his daughter Stella, who taught method acting to, among others, Marlon Brando.",

She also played male roles, including Shakespeare's Hamlet. Rostand called her \"the queen of the pose and the princess of the gesture\", while Hugo praised her \"golden voice\". She made several theatrical tours around the world, and was one of the first prominent actresses to make sound recordings and to act in motion pictures.",

  "/wiki/Harry_Houdini": "Harry Houdini (/hu\u02d0\u02c8di\u02d0ni/; born Erik Weisz, later Ehrich Weiss or Harry Weiss; March 24, 1874 \u2013 October 31, 1926) was a Hungarian-born American illusionist and stunt performer, noted for his sensational escape acts. He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the US and then as \"Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini\" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it.\n In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.\n Houdini made several movies but quit acting when it failed to bring in money. He was also a keen aviator and aimed to become the first man to fly a plane in Australia.",
  "/wiki/Adah_Isaacs_Menken": "Adah Isaacs Menken (June 15, 1835 \u2013 August 10, 1868) was an American actress, painter and poet, and was the highest earning actress of her time. She was best known for her performance in the melodrama Mazeppa, with a climax that featured her apparently nude and riding a horse on stage. After great success for a few years with the play in New York and San Francisco, she appeared in a production in London and Paris, from 1864 to 1866. After a brief trip back to the United States, she returned to Europe. However, she became ill within two years and died in Paris at the age of 33.\n Menken told many versions of her origins, including her name, place of birth, ancestry, and religion, and historians have differed in their accounts. Most have said she was born a Louisiana Creole Catholic of mixed race, with European and African ancestry. A celebrity who created sensational performances in the United States and Europe, she married several times and was also known for her affairs. She had two sons, both of whom died in infancy.\n Though she was better known as an actress, Menken sought to be known as a writer. She published about 20 essays, 100 poems, and a book of her collected poems, from 1855 to 1868 (the book was published posthumously). Early work was devoted to family and after her marriage, her poetry and essays featured Jewish themes. However, beginning with work published after moving to New York, with which she changed her style, Menken expressed a wide range of emotions and ideas about women's place in the world. Her collection Infelicia went through several editions and was in print until 1902.",

Her efforts at silent film production were less successful, but a few sound-film performances survive as a record of her art.\n Nazimova openly conducted relationships with women, and her mansion on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard was believed to be the scene of outlandish parties. She is credited with having originated the phrase \"sewing circle\" as a discreet code for lesbian or bisexual actresses.",

  "/wiki/Boris_Thomashefsky": "Boris Thomashefsky (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041f\u0438\u043d\u0445\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0422\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439; 1866\u20131939, sometimes written Thomashevsky, Thomaschevsky, etc. Yiddish \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d8\u05d0\u05de\u05d0\u05e9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9) was a Ukrainian-born (later American) Jewish singer and actor who became one of the biggest stars in Yiddish theatre.\n Thomashefsky was born in Ositniashka (\u041e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044f\u0436\u043a\u0430) a village in the Kiev Governorate in the Russian Empire, and grew up in the neighboring town Kamianka (today in the Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine). At the age of 11, he left for Berdichev (Berdychiv, Ukraine), where he trained as a meshoyrer (choir singer) in the renowned synagogue choir of cantor Nisan Belzer.\n In 1881, he emigrated with his family to the United States, and just a year later, while still a teenager, he was largely responsible for the first performance of Yiddish theatre in New York City, in what was to become the Yiddish Theater District. He has been credited as the pioneer of Borscht Belt entertainment.\n Although Thomashefsky left Imperial Russia at a time when Yiddish theater was still thriving there (it was banned in September 1883), he had never actually seen it performed prior to the 1882 performance he brought together in New York. Thomashefsky, who was earning some money by singing on Saturdays at the Henry Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, was also working as a cigarette maker in a sweatshop, where he first heard songs from the Yiddish theater, sung by some of his fellow workers.\n He managed to convince a local tavern owner to invest in bringing over some performers. The first performance was Abraham Goldfaden's Yiddish operetta \u05d3\u05d9 \u05de\u05db\u05e9\u05e4\u05d4 (The Witch). The performance was a bit of a disaster: pious and prosperous \"uptown\" German Jews opposed to Yiddish theater did a great deal to sabotage it. Thomashefsky's performing career was launched partly because part of the sabotage consisted of bribing the soubrette to fake a sore throat: Thomashefsky went on in her place.\n Shortly after, the teenaged Thomashefsky was the pioneer of taking Yiddish theater \"on the road\" in the United States, performing Goldfaden's plays in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Boston and Chicago, all in the 1880s; for much of the 1880s, Chicago was his base. After Yiddish theater was banned in Russia, his tours came to include such prominent actors as Siegmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, and Jacob Adler, with new plays by playwrights such as Moses Ha-Levi Horowitz. [Adler, 1999, 312-314]\n In 1887, playing in Baltimore, he met 14-year-old Bessie Baumfeld-Kaufman, when she came backstage to meet the beautiful young \"actress\" she had seen on stage, only to discover that \"she\" was Boris. Bessie soon ran away from home to join the company, and eventually took over the ingenue roles, as Boris moved on to romantic male leads.  They were married in 1891.\n In 1891, with Mogulesko, Kessler, and Adler all engaged in starting the Union Theater, Moishe Finkel brought the still relatively unknown Thomashefsky back to New York to star at his National Theater, where Thomashefsky became such an enormous popular success in Moses Halevy Horowitz's operetta David ben Jesse as to force the Union Theater temporarily to abandon its highbrow programming and compete head on. [Adler, 1999, 318 (commentary)]\n After Adler recruited Jacob Gordin as a playwright and found a way to draw the masses to serious theater with Gordin's The Yiddish King Lear, and then turned to Shakespeare's Othello, Thomashefsky decided to show that he could compete on that ground as well, and responded with the first Yiddish production of Shakespeare's Hamlet, in which, by all reports, he acquitted himself excellently. [Adler, 1999, 329, 330] His production of \"Hamlet\" was more than just a direct translation.  The story was also tweaked to make it more accessible to a devout European Jewish audience.  At the start of the play, young Hamlet has been away at Rabbinical college, and his uncle has seduced the Queen Mother away from King Hamlet, breaking the old man's heart.  There are sectarian jokes regarding communication with angels.  Claudius spreads a rumor that Prince Hamlet has succumbed to nihilism while away, but his scheme is discovered and the traitor is sent to Siberia in his nephew's stead.  The play ends early, with Hamlet ceremonially marrying Ophelia at her funeral then dying of a broken heart.  These types of edits were not uncommon in the Yiddish-language theatre scene.  Some critics view it as a step away from immigrant assimilation, others as one step further towards common ground between the new residents and their American neighbors.  These productions ushered in what is generally seen as the first great age of Yiddish theater, centered in New York and lasting approximately until a new wave of Jewish immigration, in 1905\u20141908 once again resulted in a vogue for broad comedy, vaudeville and light operettas, which the Thomashefskys embraced wholeheartedly, especially in performing Leon Kobrin's plays about immigrant life. [Adler, 1999, passim, 359 (commentary)]\n Other notable Thomashefsky productions included Yiddish versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Goethe's Faust and, unlikely as it may seem, Wagner's Parsifal. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, in an adaptation of Hamlet called Der Yeshiva Bokher (The Yeshiva Student), \"a wicked uncle smears [a] rabbinic candidate\u2019s reputation by calling him a nihilist and the young man dies of a broken heart.\" (They don't say whether this was the production that went head to head with the Adler/Kessler Othello.)\n By 1910, Thomashefsky owned a 12-room home on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, plus a bungalow by the sea, and 20 acres (81,000 m\u00b2) in Hunter, New York which included an open-air theater, Thomashefsky's Paradise Gardens. Each of his three sons had an Arabian horse. [Adler, 1999, 359 (commentary)]\n However, in 1915, Thomashefsky filed for bankruptcy, listing assets of $21,900 and debts of $76,297.65.\n In 1935, late in his career, Thomashefsky was an actor/singer in Henry Lynn's Yiddish film, Bar Mitzvah, in which he played a melodramatic role with gusto and co-produced the film. He sang, Erlekh Zayn (Be Virtuous), a song from a 1924 Yiddish play, Bar Mitzvah.\n With his wife, actress Bessie Thomashefsky, he had three sons, as well a daughter who died when she was six years old.  The third son, Theodore, changed his name to Ted Thomas and became a stage manager. One of Ted Thomas's sons is the noted conductor Michael Tilson Thomas.  The first son, Harry, went on to direct his father in the films Bar Mitzvah and The Jewish King Lear, and later moved with his mother to Los Angeles.  The second son, known as Mickey, had affairs with two women at the same time, which led to a dramatic murder-attempt/suicide in 1931, reminiscent of his Aunt Emma Thomashefsky Finkel's notorious 1904 affair. Both Mickey and his Aunt Emma were left paralyzed by the attempted murders by jealous mates and both later died of complications related to their wounds; Emma, many years later, in 1929, and Mickey, five years after in 1936.  Boris Thomashefsky carried on a long-term affair with Yiddish actress Regina Zuckerberg, who modeled herself on Bessie in dress, speech, style and acting\u2014except that she was twenty years younger.  This caused a separation between Boris and Bessie, who both went on to successful but separate careers, until Boris became a pauper in the 1930s.\n Both Thomashefskys did much to shape the world of modern theatre from the follies to Broadway and gave a start to many actors, composers and producers who went on to start and own theaters and movie studios.  Even the Gershwin brothers had their start with the Thomashefkys.  The Thomashefskys were also prominent in addressing controversial social issues of the day and in teaching the Greenhorns how to be Americans.  They not only founded theaters and production companies, but had publishing houses and many other successful business adventures.  Boris Thomashefsky even founded and funded a Jewish Army which he sent to Israel and was named after him.  The unit later became a unit in the British Army.\n Thomashefsky is buried with his wife, who, though separated from him by 1911, never divorced him, in the Yiddish theater section of the Mount Hebron Cemetery.\n In the third Marx Brothers movie, Monkey Business, Groucho Marx (in defending his right to hide in a gangster's moll's closet) exclaims, \"That's what they said to Thomas Edison, mighty inventor, Thomas Lindbergh, mighty flyer, and Thomashefsky, 'mighty like a rose'!\"   Tribute was also paid in Mel Brooks' 1968 film The Producers when Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) attributes his acumen as a Broadway producer to the tutelage of \"the great Boris Thomashefsky\"; the line is also present in the stage musical and film musical versions, in the song \"The King of Broadway\".\n In 2011 Shuler Hensley portrayed Boris Thomashefsky in The Thomashefskys: Music and Memories of a Life in the Yiddish Theater, a concert stage show celebrating the Thomashefskys and the music of American Yiddish theatre hosted by their grandson the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas. The show aired on the PBS series Great Performances in 2012.",
