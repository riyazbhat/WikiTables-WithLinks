The two 152-metre (499 ft) tall pylons are located at Kjerringvik on the west side, and at Vangshylla on the east side. Following the opening, there was a seventeen-year collection of tolls, needed to finance 30% of the 200 million kr investment. In 2007, the bridge was listed as a cultural heritage.  In 2012, the municipalities of Mosvik and Inder\u00f8y (on either side of the bridge) were merged to form one large municipality of Inder\u00f8y.",

  "/wiki/List_of_longest_cable-stayed_bridge_spans": "This list ranks the world's cable-stayed bridges by the length of main span, i.e. the distance between the suspension towers. The length of the main span is the most common way to rank cable-stayed bridges. If one bridge has a longer span than another, it does not mean that the bridge is the longer from shore to shore, or from anchorage to anchorage. However, the size of the main span does often correlate with the height of the towers, and the engineering complexity involved in designing and constructing the bridge."
