  "/wiki/College_Fjord": "College Fjord is a fjord located in the northern sector of Prince William Sound in the U.S. state of Alaska. The fjord contains five tidewater glaciers (glaciers that terminate in water), five large valley glaciers, and dozens of smaller glaciers, most named after renowned East Coast colleges (women's colleges for the NW side, and men's colleges for the SE side).  College Fjord was discovered in 1899 during the Harriman Expedition, at which time the glaciers were named. The expedition included a Harvard and an Amherst professor, and they named many of the glaciers after elite colleges. According to Bruce Molina, author of Alaska's Glaciers, \"They took great delight in ignoring Princeton.\"",

An exclave of the U.S., it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world. It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015\u2014more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware. Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.",
  "/wiki/Hood_Canal": "Hood Canal is a fjord forming the western lobe, and one of the four main basins, of Puget Sound in the US state of Washington.

  "/wiki/Washington_(state)": "Washington (/\u02c8w\u0252\u0283\u026a\u014bt\u0259n/ (listen)), officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Named for George Washington, the first U.S. president, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state, which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington State to distinguish it from the nation's capital, Washington, D.C..\n Washington is the 18th largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km2), and the 13th most populous state, with more than 7.4 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.",
  "/wiki/Icy_Bay,_Alaska": "Icy Bay is a body of water in Southeast Alaska, formed in the last 100 years[timeframe?] by the rapid retreat of the Guyot, Yahtse, and Tyndall Glaciers.  It is part of the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness.\n At the beginning of the 20th century, the bay entrance was permanently blocked by a giant tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska. A century-long[timeframe?] glacial retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles (48 km) long.\n Icy Bay is popular destination for sea kayakers, and is reachable by bush plane from Yakutat, Alaska.",
  "/wiki/Lynn_Canal": "Lynn Canal is an inlet (not an artificial canal) into the mainland of southeast Alaska.\n Lynn Canal runs about 90 miles (140 km) from the inlets of the Chilkat River south to Chatham Strait and Stephens Passage. At over 2,000 feet (610 m) in depth, Lynn Canal is the deepest fjord in North America (outside Greenland) and one of the deepest and longest in the world.\n The northern portion of the canal braids into the respective Chilkat, Chilkoot, and Taiya Inlets.\n Lynn Canal was explored by Joseph Whidbey in 1794 and named by George Vancouver for his birthplace, King's Lynn, Norfolk, England.",
  "/wiki/Misty_Fjords_National_Monument": "Misty Fiords National Monument (or Misty Fjords National Monument) is a national monument and wilderness area administered by the U.S. Forest Service as part of the Tongass National Forest. Misty Fiords is about 40 miles (64 km) east of Ketchikan, Alaska, along the Inside Passage coast in extreme southeastern Alaska, comprising 2,294,343 acres (928,488 ha) of Tongass National Forest in Alaska's Panhandle. All but 151,832 acres (61,444 ha) are designated as wilderness.\n Congress reserved the remainder for the Quartz Hill molybdenum deposit, possibly the largest such mineral deposit in the world. The national monument was originally proclaimed by President Jimmy Carter in December 1978 as Misty Fiords National Monument, using the authorization of the Antiquities Act and became a part of an ongoing political struggle between the federal government and the State of Alaska over land use policy and authority that finally led to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980. In that law, it was statutorily established as Misty Fjords National Monument.",
  "/wiki/Nassau_Fjord": "Nassau Fjord or Nassau Fiord is a four mile long inlet in Alaska branching off from Prince William Sound.\nNassau Fjord is glacially carved and also home to the famous tidewater Chenega Glacier which shares a two mile long calving face with the Fjord. The Princeton and Tigertail Glaciers both come terminate within one mile of the fjord's waters as well.\n Due to the large amount of glacial activity in the fjord, it is a popular destination for many kayakers and boaters and features many icebergs. Most trips to the fjord leave from nearby Chenega or Whittier.",

It is a complex estuarine system of interconnected marine waterways and basins, with one major and two minor connections to the open Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Juan de Fuca\u2014Admiralty Inlet being the major connection and Deception Pass and Swinomish Channel being the minor. Water flow through Deception Pass is approximately equal to 2% of the total tidal exchange between Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Its average depth is 450 feet (140 m) and its maximum depth, off Jefferson Point between Indianola and Kingston, is 930 feet (280 m). The depth of the main basin, between the southern tip of Whidbey Island and Tacoma, Washington, is approximately 600 feet (180 m). In 2009, the term Salish Sea was established by the United States Board on Geographic Names as the collective waters of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Strait of Georgia.",
  "/wiki/Russell_Fjord": "Russell Fjord is a fjord in the U.S. state of Alaska. It extends north to Disenchantment Bay, the terminus of Hubbard Glacier, at the head of Yakutat Bay. The fjord was named in 1906 by Marcus Baker of the U.S. Geological Survey for explorer Israel Russell, who discovered the estuary in 1891 while exploring the Yakutat region.\n The opening into Disenchantment Bay was periodically blocked by the glacier and the Russell Fjord turned into a lake collecting freshwater run-off from the glacier. The entrance closed from May to October 1986, and again briefly in 2002.",

Both fjords are over 30 miles (48 km) long and one-fifth of their area is covered in ice. During the summer, the fjords have considerable floating ice ranging from hand-sized to pieces as large as a three-story building. During the most recent glaciated period, both fjords were filled with active glaciers.",
  "/wiki/List_of_fjords_of_the_United_States": "The fjords of the United States are mostly found along the glacial regions of the coasts of Alaska and Washington. These fjords \u2014 long narrow inlets in valleys carved by glacial activity \u2014 can have two or more basins separated by sills. \n Most of the fjords in Washington originate off Puget Sound and the Salish Sea, while fjords in Alaska originate from numerous, more varied locations. \n Somes Sound, a fjard located within Acadia National Park, is often mistaken for being the only fjord located along the eastern coast of the United States."
