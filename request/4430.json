Located entirely within Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, the four parks, together, protect 45% of all remaining coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) old-growth forests, totaling at least 38,982 acres (157.75\u00a0km2). These trees are the tallest, among the oldest,and one of the most massive tree species on Earth.
