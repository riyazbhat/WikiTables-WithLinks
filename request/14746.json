  "/wiki/Avalon_Theater_(Larimore,_North_Dakota)": "The Avalon Theater is a Historic Art Deco style Movie theater located in the commercial district of Larimore, North Dakota, United States.  Built in 1938 as a 350-seat theater, the Avalon's most significant feature is its Art Deco detailing, especially the marquee, box office, and entry doors and continuing with simple Art Deco geometry motifs in the interior, all of which has survived.  The building is constructed of brick with a parabolic poured concrete floor in the seating area to ensure a good view for all.  The building still functions as a movie theater, with its original projectors, and also is home to local live theater groups.\n The Avalon Theater is historically significant as a rare example of Art Deco theaters built during the Great Depression.  It is part of a vanishing genre of small town movie houses, and is the only remaining Art Deco building in Larimore.\n The Avalon Theater played Broadway Serenade on its opening night, April 28, 1939.",

  "/wiki/Harriet_and_Thomas_Beare_House": "The Harriet and Thomas Beare House is a Victorian house located on Reeves Drive in the Near Southside Historic District of Grand Forks, North Dakota.\n The house was built in 1901 for real estate man Thomas Beare on Reeves Drive, the most prestigious residential street in Grand Forks, and exemplifies the conspicuous consumption of the cities' elite during the Progressive Era and the growth of the Second Dakota Boom.\n It is a significant example of the Queen Anne style with elements taken from the Classical Revival style.  Queen Anne details include decorative chimneys, complexity of roof shapes such as conical turrets and hipped roof dormers, finials, and fish-scale shingled gable ends.  The house is a relatively simple expression of the style and shows signs of transition into the Classical Revival style in its symmetrical facade, Ionic columns, Doric details, and regular footprint.  A notable feature is the Porte-cochere which is fairly rare in Grand Forks.\n The Harriet and Thomas Beare House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.  It is also known as the Margaret E. Bowler Murphy and Michael F. Murphy House.",
  "/wiki/Grand_Forks,_North_Dakota": "Grand Forks is the third-largest city in the American state of North Dakota (after Fargo and Bismarck) and is the county seat of Grand Forks County. According to the 2010 census, the city's population was 52,838, while the total of the city and surrounding metropolitan area was 98,461. Grand Forks, along with its twin city of East Grand Forks, Minnesota, forms the center of the Grand Forks, ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is often called Greater Grand Forks or the Grand Cities.\n Located on the western banks of the north-flowing Red River of the North, in a flat region known as the Red River Valley, the city is prone to flooding. The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called Les Grandes Fourches by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, steamboat captain Alexander Griggs platted a community after being forced to winter there. The Grand Forks post office was established in 1870, and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at the fork of the Red River and the Red Lake River.\n Historically dependent on local agriculture, the city's economy now encompasses higher education, defense, health care, manufacturing, food processing, and scientific research. Grand Forks is served by Grand Forks International Airport and Grand Forks Air Force Base. The city's University of North Dakota is the oldest institution of higher education in the state. The Alerus Center and Ralph Engelstad Arena host athletic and other events, while the Empire Arts Center and Chester Fritz Auditorium are the city's largest cultural venues.",
  "/wiki/R.S._Blome_Granitoid_Pavement_in_Grand_Forks": "R.S. Blome Granitoid Pavement is a historic road surface, as well as the associated cut sandstone curbs in a few sections, found in three of the oldest residential sections of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  It is a Portland cement\u2013aggregate combination that was intended to bridge the gap between the needs of Horse-drawn vehicles, which required sure footing, and automobiles, which needed a hard, resilient surface, in the earliest part of the 20th century.\n R.S. Blome Granitoid was made from a mixture of Portland cement and angular granite chips along with other stone and sand, laid down over an appropriately arched prepared road bed followed by a six-inch layer of loose gravel (macadam).  It was laid in five-foot sections which were sealed at the joints with an asphalt and rubber mix to allow for expansion.  Another intended benefit of laying the pavement in these sections was that it allowed for removal of only necessary portions for utility work.  However it would appear that this intention was ignored as indicated by the presence of utility cuts and mismatched concrete and asphalt patching in the Grand Forks examples.\n Over these sections was laid a two-inch finish layer of Portland cement and carefully screened angular granite chips measuring between 1/8 and 3/8 of an inch.  Angular chips of granite were specified over rounded river gravel to ensure a firm bond and prohibit the dislodging of gravel common to concrete.  As the surface dried it was brushed and scored to resemble cut stone, providing a good non-slip surface for horses.  Though the Blome Company patent specified a gridded pattern of scoring, the Grand Forks pavement exhibits a running bond pattern.\n Also surviving are a number of bronze name plates embedded into the paving surface which read \"Established 1888.  GRANITOID. R.S. Blome. Chicago. 1907.\"\n This pavement type was selected after a lively discussion by city residents as a solution to the problem of ankle-deep mud which was an annual result of the spring thaw and rains.  The residents determined to have a quality pavement that would last long \"after it was paid for\".  Their choice has been validated as the Granitoid is still quite serviceable and well suited to modern automobile traffic after nearly a century of use.\n Out of several extant locations where Blome Granitoid has been found, such as Duluth, Minnesota, Calumet, Michigan and Spokane and Seattle, Washington, there are several characteristics which make the Grand Forks sections particularly significant.  There is more surviving Granitoid and the associated brass name plates in Grand Forks, encompassing a number of streets in three distinct neighborhoods, than in any of the other locations.  Another important difference is the aforementioned use of the running bond pattern in the scoring, which is unique among all of the remaining examples.  It suggests a desire among the residents for an aesthetic, as well as functional, pavement.\n A 55-acre (22 ha) area was listed on the National Register in 1991.  However, the listing was modified in 2010 to decrease the listed area.",

  "/wiki/Thomas_D._Campbell_House": "The Thomas D. Campbell House is a historic Gothic Revival style log and wood frame home located in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  It is significant for its association with Thomas D. Campbell, who became the largest wheat farmer in the United States.  It is part of the Myra Museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n Built in 1879 for Thomas D. Campbell, the house consists of the original 1879 log cabin enclosed within a later Gothic Revival wood frame addition, which is dated to ca. 1881-1900, with an overall L-shaped floor plan.  The home has gabled roofs and clapboard siding.  The main facade and south gables are distinguished by lace bargeboards, and the west gable contains a pointed window.  A porch extends across the west facade and is supported by turned posts and bentwood arches.  It is the only building remaining from the Campbell family's pioneer farmstead.\n The interior of the house serves as a museum, and is fitted out with turn of the 20th century furnishings befitting a family residence.  The chinked log walls and hand-hewn loft joists of the original 1879 log cabin are exposed from within.\n At the time of its construction the Campbell house was south of the tiny settlement of Grand Forks; it was one of a string of pioneer homes along the Red River, with no other buildings in its immediate area.  Associated with the First Dakota Boom and the pre-railroad (pre-1880) era, it is a significant example of the architecture of this period. Log structures were popular at this time due to the expense of hauling cut lumber up the river from the railhead in Fargo.  The practiced of constructing a fairly simple log home, to be supplanted or engulfed later on by a more substantial structure, appears to have been fairly common to the area at this time.  The house is notable for being the only Gothic Revival farmhouse in Grand Forks and one of only a few houses of this style in North Dakota's Red River Valley region, and at the time of its enlargement was one of the finer homes in the area.",
  "/wiki/George_B._Clifford_House": "The George B. Clifford House is a Queen Anne style Victorian home located in the Near Southside Historic District of Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Clifford on Reeves Dr., a street of impressive homes built for the early elite of the city of Grand Forks.  It is one of North Dakota's best examples of early Queen Anne architecture.  Because it was built only 13 years after the Watts-Sherman House in Newport, Rhode Island, said to be the first Queen Anne style house in the country, it is closer in design and detail to the original style as elaborated by Richard Norman Shaw.\n The house is also significant historically for its connection to George B. Clifford.  Clifford was a prominent businessman, attorney, and real estate man, and one of the three founders of the Cream of Wheat company.  His investments and links to northeastern capital represented an important contribution to the early years of progress after the first settlement of Grand Forks.",

It empties into Lake Winnipeg, whose waters join the Nelson River and ultimately flow into Hudson Bay.\n Several urban areas have developed on both sides of the Red River, including Winnipeg in Canada, as well as Fargo-Moorhead and Grand Forks-East Grand Forks which straddle the American states of North Dakota and Minnesota. The Red is about 885 kilometres (550 mi) long, of which about 635 kilometres (395 mi) are in the United States and about 255 kilometres (158 mi) are in Canada. The river falls 70 metres (230 ft) on its trip to Lake Winnipeg, where it spreads into the vast deltaic wetland known as Netley Marsh.\n In the United States, the Red River is sometimes called the Red River of the North.
