  "/wiki/Walt_Disney": "Walter Elias Disney (/\u02c8d\u026azni/; December 5, 1901 \u2013 December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.\n In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the amusement park industry, and in 1955 he opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as Walt Disney's Disneyland and The Mickey Mouse Club; he was also involved in planning the 1959 Moscow Fair, the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the 1964 New York World's Fair. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, Disney World, the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.\n Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his namesake studio and company maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.",

  "/wiki/Iraqi_people": "The Iraqi people, sometimes colloquially, Mesopotamians, or the people of Mesopotamia (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u02bfIr\u0101qiyy\u016bn, Kurdish: \u06af\u0647\u200c\u0644\u06cc \u0639\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u00ceraq\u00eeyan, Classical Syriac: \u0725\u0721\u0710 \u0725\u071d\u072a\u0729\u071d\u0710\u200e \u02bfIr\u0101q\u0101y\u0101, Turkish: Irakl\u0131lar) are people identified with the country of Iraq.\n Ancient Iraq is referred to as Mesopotamia and has throughout its history been a multiethnic and multicultural region. Historically, ancient peoples who inhabited Iraq were the Sumerians and Babylonians to the south, Akkadians in the central-south and Assyrians to the north of the country. An Arab population has been present in the country as early as the second or third century BC, about four centuries before the Islamic conquest in the seventh century. The earliest known recorded language in history is the Sumerian language, originating in southern Iraq (Sumer-Babylonia). During the third millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians of the south and the Akkadians to further north in central Mesopotamia, in which there was very widespread bilingualism of both peoples able to speak the Sumerian and Akkadian languages. The Syriac language (which originated in Mesopotamia), as well as Christianity, has been present in Iraq since the first century, which was introduced by Thomas the Apostle. Christians in Iraq are one of the world's oldest continuous communities in the world, and after Palestine/Israel, Iraq is the location of the most biblical history than any other country in the world. Before the advent of Islam to Iraq, the majority of the population who inhabited Iraq followed various branches of Eastern Christianity, Judaism or indigenous ancient Mesopotamian religions. The pre-Islamic people of Iraq included people from various ethnic groups in Mesopotamia; and the majority of them spoke the Syriac language, despite not all being ethnic Syriacs, Assyrians or Christians. Syriac Christianity first emerged in Upper Mesopotamia and the Nestorian Church (Church of the East) and its successor churches were established in the major ancient Mesopotamian Greek-Persian city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in central-southern Iraq. The first Arab kingdom outside Arabia was established in Northern Iraq in the second century and was called the Kingdom of Araba. Additionally, the Lakhmids were Arabs present in parts of central-southern Mesopotamia from the third century until the Islamic conquest. The Lakhmids were Nestorian Christians following Syriac Christianity, and were bilingual in both Syriac and Arabic, and contributed greatly to the Church of the East. Iraq boasts a rich and vital contribution to Christian history, in particular Eastern and Syriac Christianity, which has been the most dominant branch of Christianity in Iraq since its establishment for over fifteen centuries, and is one of the largest in the greater Fertile Crescent region (Mesopotamia and the Levant) as a whole. The Lakhmids of Mesopotamia have also played a key role in Arab history; it was in the Arab Syriac Christian capital of Al-Hirah where the alphabet of the Arabic language was standardised. Additionally, during the Arab and Islamic Golden Age, Iraq and the capital Baghdad became the centre of the scientific world for centuries, where the people of the region excelled in the development of medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, agriculture, economics, architecture, sociology, literature, art, poetry and philosophy, and included not only Arabs and Muslims, but also Persians, Syriacs, Christians, Nestorians, Assyrians and others from various ethnoreligious backgrounds, which formed an integral part in the cultivation of Arab civilization, of which Iraq and its cultural diversity has played a key and major role in.\n Following the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia in the seventh century, a large proportion of the indigenous Syriac, Persian and other non-Arabic speaking people of Iraq (who largely practiced Eastern Christianity, Judaism or ancient Mesopotamian religions) became Muslims and were Arabized, eventually adopting the Arab identity with their religion, despite the majority of them not being ethnic Arabs. Along with the Arabized Mesopotamian natives, the minor migrations that took place during the rule of successive Islamic dynasties, and the pre-Islamic Arabs who had lived in the country centuries before, the Arabic-speaking people of Iraq would eventually become the present-day Iraqi Arab ethnic group. Despite Arabization of a large proportion of the Mesopotamians, a Christian group of indigenous people from Mesopotamia, resisted Islamization as well as Arabization, retaining their Syriac Christian religion and language to this day. This group would become the present-day Chaldo-Assyrian peoples of Iraq, who make up the majority of Iraqi Christians. Mesopotamian Arabic developed as the dominant language in the country, and is a Syriac substrate, and also shares significant influences from ancient Mesopotamian languages of Akkadian, Sumerian and Babylonian, as well as other local and Middle Eastern languages such as Persian, Turkish and Greek. Mesopotamian Arabic is said to be the most Syriac influenced dialect of Arabic, due to Syriac having originated in Mesopotamia, and spread throughout the Middle East (Fertile Crescent) during the Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian period, eventually becoming the lingua franca of the entire region for centuries before the spread of the Arabic language. Mesopotamian Arabs and Assyrians are the largest Semitic peoples of Iraq, sharing significant similarities in language between Mesopotamian Arabic and Syriac, and Kurds are the largest Iranic ethnic group, sharing similarities in language with the other Iranic peoples in the country, such as the Yazidis and Shabaks. Iraqi Turkmen are the largest Turkic ethnic group in the country. Studies indicate that the different ethnoreligious groups of Iraq and Mesopotamia share significant similarities in genetics, and that Iraqi Mesopotamian Arabs, who make up the majority of Iraqis, are more genetically related to other non-Arab populations in the region such as Assyrians, Kurds, Iranians and Turks, than they are to Arabs of the Arabian peninsula.\n Iraq today remains one of the most multicultural countries in the region, with various indigenous peoples, as well as a diverse number of diasporic communities from around the world who have chosen to make Iraq their home. The population was estimated to be 40,194,216 in 2018 (residing in Iraq), and over 10 million living in the diaspora, with most of the population being Mesopotamian Arab (75%), followed by Kurds (20%), Chaldo-Assyrians (10-15%) (500,000+ (in Iraq) to 2 million in total with diaspora numbers), Turkmen (3 million), Afro-Iraqis (1 million), Yazidis (500,000-900,000) and Shabaks (300,000-500,000). Other minorities include Iraqi-Armenians, Mandeans, Yarsans, Doms and Kawliya (Indian descent), Ajam (Persian descent), Circassians and Chechens (North Caucasian descent) and others. Iraqis are 64% Shia Muslim, 31% Sunni Muslim, 10-15% Christian (majority of whom are Syriacs but also Greek Orthodox and Melkite Catholic Arabs), 1.4% Yazidi, and several other indigenous faiths. The most spoken languages are Mesopotamian Arabic (which is taught and spoken by all those living in Iraq), Kurdish, Syriac and Iraqi Turkmen of the Turkish language. The percentages of different ethnoreligious groups residing in Iraq vary from source to source due to the last Iraqi census having taken place over 30 years ago. A new census of Iraq is planned to take place in 2020 in which the populations of each ethnoreligious group in Iraq will be clearly defined.",

It was released to mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal work On the Origin of Species.\n A historian featured in the film has stated that the creationist backing of the film had been concealed when he agreed to take part, that the editing of his words could give a false impression of his views, and that the film presents a historically distorted portrait of Darwin. Creation Ministries agreed that they had set up a \"front company\" to approach experts. They denied any deception and stated that one of the interviewees had admitted that while the producers choose comments they \"didn't distort what we said\", and compared their approach to that used by the BBC in making documentaries.\n The three historians featured in the film subsequently issued a statement that they had been misrepresented by the film company's selective reconstruction of Darwin's voyage.\nCMI countered these claims with extended quotes from the interviews of the historians. Their response was described as appearing to be sound in specific aspects by American skeptic Jim Lippard, who had not seen the film at that time. Having seen the film, he described it as trying to hide its own creationism, which becomes increasingly apparent as the film progresses.",
