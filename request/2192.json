At the provincial level, the Conservatives won a majority government under the leadership of Hugh John Macdonald.  The Conservative Party assumed office on January 10, 1900, and McFadden was appointed as Minister of Public Works and Provincial Secretary.

He moved to Manitoba in 1871, and became a mill owner and general merchant, also serving on the Protestant school board.\n Manitoba's boundaries were expanded in 1881, and Davidson was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election as the first member for Dauphin.  A Liberal, he defeated his sole opponent, P.S. St. Clair McGregor, 148 votes to 17.\n Party affiliations were fluid in Manitoba in this period, and by the general election of 1883 Davidson was identifying himself as a Liberal-Conservative, and a supporter of Premier John Norquay.  He was re-elected in Dauphin without opposition.\n Following redistribution, Davidson campaigned in the Beautiful Plains constituency for the provincial election of 1886.  The Liberals saw their support rise in this campaign, and Davidson (now a Conservative) lost to Liberal John Crawford by thirty votes.  Crawford again defeated Davidson in the 1888 election, this time by twenty-four votes.\n Provincial support for the Conservatives recovered slightly in the 1892 election, and Davidson defeated Crawford by sixteen votes in their third encounter.  The opposition caucus to which he belonged initially chose William Alexander Macdonald as its leader.  When Macdonald's constituency election was overturned in 1893, Davidson was chosen in his place.  He made his first speech as leader of the opposition in January 1894.  Davidson was a moderate figure, whose interventions were respected by the province's Liberal leadership.\n He did not serve as opposition leader for long.  His constituency victory was also overturned on April 17, 1894, and he was subsequently defeated by John Forsyth of the Patrons of Industry in a by-election.  After his loss, the leadership of the opposition seems to have fallen to James Fisher, an Independent MLA.  Davidson again lost to a Patrons of Industry candidate in the 1896 election.\n Though the Conservatives returned to government in the 1899 election, Davidson was once again defeated in Beautiful Plains, losing to Liberal Robert Ennis by ninety votes.  He was, nonetheless, appointed to cabinet by Premier Hugh John Macdonald in January 1900, serving as Provincial Treasurer, Minister of Agriculture, and Provincial Lands Commissioner.  Ennis was persuaded to resign his seat the following month, and Crawford was returned to the legislature in a by-election.\n Rodmond Roblin took the Agriculture portfolio for himself on becoming Premier in late 1900, but kept Davidson in his other two positions.

The Conservatives won the election, and Campbell was named as a minister without portfolio in Macdonald's government on January 10, 1900.  He was promoted to Attorney General on October 9 of the same year.\n In this period of Canadian history, newly appointed ministers were required to resign their legislative seats to seek a new mandate from their electors.  These by-elections were usually mere formalities, and many ministers were returned without opposition.  Campbell faced a challenge from Liberal Matthew Laurie, and defeated him by 278 votes on October 29, 1900.  This by-election occurred on the same day that Roblin replaced Macdonald as premier.

  "/wiki/Rodmond_Roblin": "Sir Rodmond Palen Roblin KCMG (February 15, 1853 \u2013 February 16, 1937) was a businessman and politician in Manitoba, Canada .\n Roblin was born in Sophiasburgh, in Prince Edward County, Canada West (later Ontario). The Roblin family was established in Sophiasburgh by Loyalist farmers Philip and Elizabeth Roblin from Smith's Clove (now known as Monroe) in Orange County, New York. He was educated at Albert College in Belleville, arrived in Winnipeg in 1877, and worked as a grain merchant.  Roblin served as reeve of Dufferin for five years and as warden for two, and was also a school trustee in the community.\n He entered provincial politics in the 1886 Manitoba election, running as a Liberal Party candidate against Conservative cabinet minister David H. Wilson in the constituency of Dufferin North.  He lost this race by five votes, but won a subsequent by-election held on May 12, 1888.\n The by-election took place shortly after Thomas Greenway was inaugurated as Manitoba's first Liberal premier.  Roblin was a supporter of Greenway in this period, and was re-elected by acclamation when the new premier called another provincial election for July 1888.\n Although Greenway's Liberals won this election with a landslide majority, the new premier was unable to fulfill a campaign promise for the development of local railways.  The Canadian Pacific Railway had lost its formal monopoly in the region, but it was still the dominant line and transportation costs remained high.  Confronted with Greenway's failure, Roblin abandoned the government in 1889 and caucused with the small Conservative opposition.  With the death of John Norquay in the same year, he emerged as the party's leading spokesman.  Roblin was the Conservative Party's de facto leader in the legislature between 1890 and 1892.\n In opposition, Roblin spoke against Greenway's proposed education reforms.  After his failure to reform the provincial railway system, Greenway repudiated an earlier pledge and withdrew state support for Manitoba's Catholic and francophone education system.  His reforms triggered a national political crisis, known as the Manitoba Schools Question.  While many Canadian francophones regarded Greenway's policy as discriminatory, it was extremely popular with Manitoba's anglophone and Protestant majority.  Greenway's government was re-elected in the 1892 election, and Roblin was personally defeated in the rural constituency including the town of Morden.\n Greenway won another landslide victory in the 1896 election, although Roblin was this time returned to the legislature for the constituency of Woodlands.  He became the parliamentary leader of the Conservatives for a second time, but stood aside to allow Hugh John Macdonald to become the official leader of the party in 1897.\n The 1899 provincial election very different from the previous two campaigns.  The schools question was resolved in 1896, and Greenway was forced to defend a fairly mediocre record on other issues against a more organized opposition.  The result was a narrow victory for Macdonald's Conservatives, who won 22 of 40 seats.  Macdonald was inaugurated as premier early in 1900.  Roblin, who was re-elected in Woodlands and was the main architect of the Conservative victory, was left out of cabinet.\n Macdonald resigned as premier on October 29, 1900, to run for the Conservative Party of Canada against Clifford Sifton in the federal riding of Brandon.  Roblin became premier in his place, and also took the powerful cabinet position of Railway Commissioner.  In December, he also appointed himself as Minister of Agriculture as well.  This consolidation of power reflected Roblin's personal authority over both the government and the provincial Conservative Party: his control over both would be unquestioned for the next fourteen years.\n While Greenway had won elections on single-issue populism, Roblin relied on \"machine politics\" for his electoral success.  Despite (or because of) some coercion, he was able to effectively dispense patronage and could rely on the support of many loyal followers at the community level.\n Roblin's Conservatives won thirty-one seats in the 1903 election, against nine for Greenway's Liberals.  The extent of this victory may be credited to Greenway's leadership of the Liberal Party\u2014he was increasingly uninterested in provincial politics, and was spending much of his time looking for a federal patronage appointment.  Roblin's machine also coasted to easy victories in 1907 and 1910, winning twenty-eight of forty-one seats on both occasions.\n Roblin played a crucial role in the 1911 federal election on reciprocity, by putting his electoral machine at the disposal of the federal Conservative Party.  In so doing, Roblin helped to defeat Sir Wilfrid Laurier and put Robert Borden in power.  Borden, in turn, enacted legislation to expand Manitoba's boundaries to their current limit.\n Like his counterpart James Whitney in Ontario, Roblin expanded the role of government in Manitoba and promoted many initiatives that would be regarded today as progressive.  As railway commissioner, he reached an agreement with Canadian Northern Railways to build an alternate route to the lakehead, and put control of the rates into the hands of the province.  His government also promoted significant expansions in health, education and road services, all of which were required to service Manitoba's rapidly increasing population.\n Roblin's Tories created Manitoba's first crown corporations, expropriating Bell's telephone services to create a state-owned system\u2014the first effective public utilities system in Canada. The government also started a state-owned system of grain elevators to assist farmers, but this was less successful.  A scandal involving these elevators weakened his government's hold on power in the early 1910s.\n Roblin was more conservative on social issues.  He is often remembered today for his opposition to women's suffrage, and for clashing with Nellie McClung on the issue.  McClung made Roblin appear foolish in her famous \"parliament of women\", parodying the premier's patronizing comments on traditional gender roles.  Roblin also resisted demands to enact a labour code to protect workers, and was sometimes reluctant to enforce the province's existing legislation.\n Roblin is also remembered for folding to pressure from Winnipeg's business community. In 1904 he took the appalling step of reducing the age minima for child labour, and increasing the maximum hours of work for women and children.\n Roblin's handling of the prohibition issue was also controversial.  Hugh John Macdonald's government passed prohibition legislation in 1900, after two separate referendums had confirmed public support for the initiative.  Roblin was reluctant to enforce the legislation, however, because his government received significant revenues from the sale of alcohol.  He called a third referendum in 1902.  When temperance supporters boycotted the poll, prohibition was defeated by a narrow margin.\n The 1914 provincial election was the start of a watershed period in Manitoba politics.  Roblin's government went into the election weakened by a scandal involving the construction of new legislative buildings.  His opponents accused the government of corruption, claiming misappropriation of funds and overspending.  The Conservatives were re-elected by a reduced margin, winning 28 seats against 20 for the Liberals in an expanded legislature.\n When Roblin rejected calls for a formal investigation into the legislative buildings scandal, the Liberal opposition petitioned the Lieutenant Governor to take direct action. The Lieutenant-Governor convened his own commission of enquiry, popularly known as the Mathers Commission as it was led by chief justice T.A. Mathers.  After only two weeks, the commission had uncovered enough evidence to force the government's resignation.  Roblin formally resigned as premier on May 12, 1915, and Liberal leader Tobias Norris was called to form a new administration.  A new general election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide..\n The commission report concluded that Roblin, Attorney General James H. Howden and developer Thomas Kelly had conspired to commit fraud in the contract arrangements.  Roblin was indicted, but was eventually discharged of criminal responsibility.  He died in Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1937.\n Sir Rodmond Roblin is the grandfather of another Manitoba premier, Dufferin Roblin.",

He moved to Manitoba in 1879 after the death of his father, and worked in his brother Enoch Winkler's lumberyard.  In 1883, he began his own grain and lumber business in Morden.  He began farming in 1888.  After the incorporation of the Municipality of Stanley in 1890, Winkler was chosen as the community's first reeve.  He served in this position until 1892.  In the same year, the village of Winkler was established in Manitoba, named after him.  He ran a grain elevator and lumber business in the community.  Winkler was also an active freemason.\n He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election, defeating Conservative candidate N.

It should not be confused with the federal electoral division of the same name, which includes most of the provincial riding's territory but has expanded boundaries and a larger population base. The riding has existed, in one form or another, since the province's creation.\n In Manitoba's first general election (1870), the riding was divided into St. Boniface East and St. Boniface West.  It became a single constituency in 1874, and has existed continuously since then.\n The riding elected two members by preferential balloting in 1949 and 1953. On all other occasions, it has been a single-member constituency.\n St. Boniface is located in the central-eastern Winnipeg. Its boundaries roughly correspond with the historical community of Saint Boniface, Manitoba, which was a distinct civic jurisdiction before being amalgamated with the City of Winnipeg in 1971.\n The riding's population in 1996 was 19,646.

During the 1950s and 1960s, it was generally regarded as a safe seat for the Liberals.\n In 1969, St. Boniface MLA Laurent Desjardins decided to sit as a Liberal Democrat, supporting the New Democratic Party government of Edward Schreyer.
