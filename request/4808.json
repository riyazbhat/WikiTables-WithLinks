  "/wiki/Nintendo": "Nintendo Co., Ltd.[a] is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto. Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises of all-time, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Pok\u00e9mon. Nintendo was founded in 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi and originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels, without major success. Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s. Supplemented since the 1980s by its major divisions Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, it ultimately became one of the most influential in the video game industry and one of Japan's most-valuable companies with a market value of over $37 billion in 2018.",
  "/wiki/Kunio-kun": "The Kunio-kun (\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093) series is a video game series started by Techn\u014ds Japan. The series is now handled by Arc System Works who purchased all of the intellectual property rights from Techn\u014ds' spiritual successor, Million Corp. The first game in the series is fully titled Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (\u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093), which roughly translates to Hot Blood Tough Guy Kunio, with Nekketsu being the name of Kunio's high school. The kun suffix after his name is an informal Japanese honorific usually applied to young males. The series originated in the arcades and the Famicom console; its title and its protagonist, Kunio (variously renamed Alex and Crash Cooney in the United States), were named after Techn\u014ds Japan's former president, Kunio Taki. Along with that, Kunio also later became Techn\u014ds Japan's main mascot, appearing on the company's logo in several games and television commercials. Although the original game was created by Yoshihisa Kishimoto - who later designed Double Dragon - many of the later games (particularly those under the Downtown Nekketsu moniker) were the handiwork of two men: Mitsuhiro Yoshimitsu Yoshida and Hiroyuki Mokeke Sekimoto. A few of the early Kunio games for the NES were localized for the North American market. These include Renegade, River City Ransom, Super Dodge Ball, Crash 'n' the Boys: Street Challenge and Nintendo World Cup, which were heavily Americanized versions of the Kunio-kun games. Techn\u014ds Japan has released over twenty Kunio-kun titles for the Famicom, Game Boy, and Super Famicom in Japan. In addition, licensed ports of the games were made for other platforms such as the PC-Engine (through Naxat Soft), Mega Drive (through Pal Soft) and the Sharp X68000 (through Sharp).",
