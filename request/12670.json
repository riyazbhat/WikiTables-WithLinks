  "/wiki/Sam_Snead": "Samuel Jackson Snead (pronounced [sni:d]; May 27, 1912 \u2013 May 23, 2002) was an American professional golfer who was one of the top players in the world for the better part of four decades (having won PGA of America and Senior PGA Tour events over six decades) and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Snead was awarded a record 94 gold medallions, for wins in PGA of America (referred to by most as the PGA) Tour events and later credited with winning a record 82 PGA Tour events, including seven majors. He never won the U.S. Open, though he was runner-up four times. Snead was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. Snead's nicknames included The Slammer, Slammin' Sammy Snead, and The Long Ball Hitter from West Virginia, and he was admired by many for having a perfect swing, which generated many imitators. Snead was famed for his folksy image, wearing a straw hat, and making such statements as Keep close count of your nickels and dimes, stay away from whiskey, and never concede a putt. and There are no short hitters on the tour anymore, just long and unbelievably long. Fellow West Virginia Golf Hall of Fame Inductee Bill Campbell has said of Snead, He was the best natural player ever.",
  "/wiki/Waco_Turner_Open": "The Waco Turner Open was a PGA Tour event that was played in Burneyville, Oklahoma in the early 1960s. The founder of the tournament, Waco Turner, was a millionaire Oklahoma oilman with a passion for golf. He started Turner's Lodge, a golf resort on what he hoped would flourish into a 2,700-acre (11 km2) grand development of 3,000 homes with a hotel, restaurants, tennis courts, swimming pools and an airstrip built around three lakes. The project ran into financial difficulties and the PGA left after the 1964 event. The greatest claim to fame for the tournament is that in 1964 an African American golfer, Pete Brown, won an official PGA Tour event for the first time at this event. The development, now called Falconhead Resort, has changed hands repeatedly in the ensuing decades, and only about 400 homes have been built on the 3,000 home sites.",
  "/wiki/Oklahoma": "Oklahoma (/\u02cco\u028akl\u0259\u02c8ho\u028am\u0259/ (listen); Cherokee: \u13a3\u13a6\u13b3\u13b0\u13b9, ogalahoma; Choctaw: Oklahumma) is a state in the South Central region of the United States, bordered by the state of Texas on the south and west, Kansas on the north, Missouri on the northeast, Arkansas on the east, New Mexico on the west, and Colorado on the northwest. It is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially, Okies), and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning red people. It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory. Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907. With ancient mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone to severe weather.",
