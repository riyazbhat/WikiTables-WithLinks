  "/wiki/Kant": "Immanuel Kant (UK: /k\u00e6nt/, US: /k\u0251\u02d0nt/; German: [\u026a\u02c8ma\u02d0nu\u032fe\u02d0l \u02c8kant, -nu\u032f\u025bl -]; 22 April 1724\u00a0\u2013 12 February 1804) was an influential Prussian German philosopher in the Age of Enlightenment. In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, he argued that space, time, and causation are mere sensibilities; \"things-in-themselves\" exist, but their nature is unknowable. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience, with all human experience sharing certain structural features. He drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposition that worldly objects can be intuited a priori ('beforehand'), and that intuition is therefore independent from objective reality. Kant believed that reason is the source of morality, and that aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of epistemology, ethics, political theory, and post-modern aesthetics.\n In one of Kant's major works, the Critique of Pure Reason (1781), he attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. Kant wanted to put an end to an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as David Hume. Kant regarded himself as showing the way past the impasse between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized both traditions in his thought.\n Kant was an exponent of the idea that perpetual peace could be secured through universal democracy and international cooperation. He believed that this would be the eventual outcome of universal history, although it is not rationally planned. The nature of Kant's religious ideas continues to be the subject of philosophical dispute, with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he was an initial advocate of atheism who at some point developed an ontological argument for God, to more critical treatments epitomized by Schopenhauer, who criticized the imperative form of Kantian ethics as \"theological morals\" and the \"Mosaic Decalogue in disguise\" and Nietzsche, who claimed that Kant had \"theologian blood\" and was merely a sophisticated apologist for traditional Christian faith.[a]\n Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These include the Universal Natural History (1755), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (1797), the Critique of Judgment (1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology, and Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason (1793).",

Bi\u0161k\u00e9k, IPA:\u00a0[b\u02b2\u026a\u02c8\u0282k\u02b2ek]), formerly Pishpek and Frunze, is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz Republic). Bishkek is also the most commonly  administrative centre of the Chuy Region. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province, but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.\n In 1825 Khokand authorities established the fortress of \"Pishpek\" to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name, \"Pishpek\". It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast.\n In 1925 the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city as Frunze, after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze (1885\u20131925), who was born there. In 1936, the city of Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, during the final stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union. In 1991 the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to \"Bishkek\".\n Bishkek is situated at an altitude of about 800 meters (2,600\u00a0ft), just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of 4,855 meters (15,928\u00a0ft). North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan-Siberia Railway by a spur line.\n Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, watering innumerable trees to provide shade in the hot summers.",

It was founded in 1825 under the Kokand Khanate, and received city status in 1975 under the Soviets.  Its city population was officially 37,834 in the 2009 census. The municipality had a population of 54,200 according to the Soviet 1989 census.\n Kara-Balta is located on the northern slopes of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too, in the western part of Chuy Region, 62\u00a0km west of the capital of Bishkek. The road continues west through Kaindy toward Taraz, Kazakhstan. Another road goes south through the T\u00f6\u00f6-Ashuu Pass and then splits, one branch going west to Talas Province and the other south and then east through the Suusamyr valley to Balykchy on Lake Issyk Kul. It has a temperate climate. The terrain is flat, with a slight slope downwards from the south to the north.\n The Chuy Valley has been settled since the Fifth Century, but after the invasion by Genghis Khan the area was inhabited mostly by nomads and pastoralists.  However, the settlement became a town and flourished under the Khanate of Kokand.",

Its population was 14,814 in 2009. It is located along the major Bishkek-Osh route, approximately 3 miles from the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border. The settlement Kochkor-Ata was established in 1952 in regard with discovery and exploitation of Izbaskent oil field. In 2003, it was granted town status.\n The town itself maintains a high level of contrasting polarity.  The center of the town, by the bazaar and municipal buildings, highlights a late Soviet-era style of structural design and color.  Large concrete structures painted in bright colors outline central avenues and plazas.  Soviet propaganda is still framed high on old billboards and posters.  \"Oil is the strength of the people,\" reads one of the central banners.  However, much of Kochkor-Ata is rural.  East of the central plaza past the Soviet-era concrete housing complexes, lie the mainstay of the Kochkor-Ata population.  Small shacks and houses lined closely to each other, stepped along the foothills of the local mountain range, house many of the local inhabitants.  Animal husbandry and small-trade provide many of these villagers with a means of income.\n The town boasts a relatively new clothing bazaar, predominantly built by funds from Kyrgyz ex-president, Askar Akayev, alongside an older established bazaar.\n The bazaar is the center of commerce, in the small town.  It is one of the local stops along the Bishkek-Osh route, and thus maintains a daily flow of inter-and-intra related trade and small commerce.  The avto-vaksal, or bus/taxi station, is also located in the western end of the bazaar.  The local marshrutka, public transport van, runs from the Kochkor-Ata avto-vaksal to other towns along the route, most notably: Massy, Bazar-Korgon, and Jalal-Abad.\n One of the larger oil fields in Kochkor-Ata has been bought out by Chinese business and interests.\n The town has four middle schools: one Russian school, one Kyrgyz boarding school, and two other regular Kyrgyz schools.  The town is also host of a fairly new football stadium, built by funds of a prominent Kyrgyz oil company, KNG, in the town.  A hospital complex has been established adjacent to the Kyrgyz boarding school.",
