  "/wiki/Novel": "A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book. The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for \"new\", \"news\", or \"short story of something new\", itself from the Latin novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning \"new\". Walter Scott made a distinction between the novel, in which (as he saw it) \"events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society\" and the romance, which he defined as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\". However, many such romances, including the historical romances of Scott, Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a \"kindred term\". This sort of romance is in turn different from the genre fiction love romance or romance novel. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: \"a novel is le roman, der Roman, il romanzo, en roman.\" Most European languages use the word \"romance\" (as in French, Dutch, Russian, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Romanian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian \"roman\"; Finnish \"romaani\"; German \"Roman\"; Portuguese \"romance\" and Italian \"romanzo\") for extended narratives. The novel constitutes \"a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years\", with its origins in classical Greece and Rome, in medieval and early modern romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella.",

In 2013, the 50th anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" concerned this supposed destruction and their eventual survival.

The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer Terry Nation and first appeared in the 1963 Doctor Who serial The Daleks, in the shells designed by Raymond Cusick. Drawing inspiration from the Nazis, Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent, merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, who demand total conformity to their will, and who are bent on the conquest of the universe and the extermination of what they see as inferior races. In the programme's narrative the Daleks were engineered by the scientist Davros during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people, the Kaleds, and their enemies the Thals. With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by nuclear war, Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a tank-like robotic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of Doctor Who's protagonist, the Time Lord known as \"the Doctor\".

  "/wiki/Anime": "Anime (US: /\u02c8\u00e6n\u0259\u02ccme\u026a/, UK: /\u02c8\u00e6n\u026a\u02ccme\u026a/) (Japanese: \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1, Hepburn: anime, [a\u0272ime] (listen), plural: anime)[a] is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from or associated with Japan. The word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which means all forms of animated media. Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes. The culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product. Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism. The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience.",
  "/wiki/Cyborg": "A cyborg (/\u02c8sa\u026ab\u0254\u02d0r\u0261/), short for \"cybernetic organism\", is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts. The term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic, biorobot or android; it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism. D. S. Halacy's Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a \"new frontier\" that was \"not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' \u2013 a bridge...between mind and matter.\" In science fiction, the most recognizable portrayal of a cyborg is a human being with visibly mechanical parts, such as the superhero Cyborg from DC Comics or the The Borg from Star Trek. But cyborgs may also be portrayed as looking more like robots or more like ordinary humans. Cyborg may appear as humanoid robots, such as Robotman from DC's Doom Patrol or the Cybermen from Doctor Who, or they may appear as non-humanoid robots, such as the Daleks in Doctor Who or some of the Motorball players in Battle Angel Alita.",
  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings[a] were Scandinavians, who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries, raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe, and explored westwards to Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland. The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age, 793\u20131066 AD. This period of Nordic military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia, Estonia, the British Isles, France, Kievan Rus' and Sicily. Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills, and characterised by the longship, Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral, North Africa, and the Middle East. Following extended phases of (primarily sea- or river-borne) exploration, expansion and settlement, Viking (Norse) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe, Belarus, Ukraine and European Russia, the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America. This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions. Popular, modern conceptions of the Vikings\u2014the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia\u2014often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival.",
  "/wiki/Han_Solo": "Han Solo is a fictional character and protagonist in the Star Wars franchise. A primary character in the original film trilogy, Han is the captain of the Millennium Falcon, along with his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca. In the original Star Wars film, Han and Chewbacca reluctantly became involved in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire after being recruited by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his pupil Luke Skywalker to transport them to Alderaan. Over the course of the Star Wars saga, Han becomes a chief figure in the Alliance, a close friend of Luke and the love interest of Princess Leia. In the sequel trilogy, set 30 years after the original films, Han is Leia's estranged husband and the father of fallen Jedi Ben Solo, who turned to the dark dark side of the the Force and became Kylo Ren, the lead enforcer of the tyrannical First Order. The character was portrayed by Harrison Ford for all three films of the original Star Wars trilogy. Following a 32-year hiatus, Ford reprised the role for Disney's sequel trilogy, receiving top billing for his work in 2015's The Force Awakens, and an uncredited cameo in 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Mythologist Joseph Campbell said of the character, \"He thinks he's an egoist; but he really isn't.",

This prescience-enhancing property makes safe and accurate interstellar travel possible. Melange comes with a steep price, however: it is addictive, and withdrawal is fatal. Harvesting melange is also hazardous in the extreme, as its only known source is the harsh desert planet Arrakis, and melange deposits are guarded by giant sandworms.",
