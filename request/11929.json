  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games\u2014it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria. While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.",

  "/wiki/Dawn_George": "Dawn Denise George (born April 30, 1959 in Gardner, Massachusetts), better known plainly as Dawn George, is a former female boxer who has competed against some of women's boxing top athletes. George moved to Lowell, where Micky Ward, another retired boxer, was born. George had a negative win-loss record; many facts can be attributed to this: for example, apart from fighting some tough women boxers and world champions, she was 39 when she debuted in professional boxing. Most boxers are considered old, over the hill or past their prime by the age of 30. Dawn George debuted as a paid boxer on April 10, 1998, earning a four-round decision win over Angela Reiss at Worcester. On August 2, she knocked out Jackie Starkey in the first round, but, nineteen days later, she suffered her first defeat: in what was her first fight outside Massachusetts, she lost a six-round decision to the more experienced and younger Mitzi Jeter.
