The University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in Oakland before moving to its campus in Berkeley in 1873. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus at Berkeley, with Robert Gordon Sproul remaining in place as the first systemwide President, Clark Kerr becoming the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley, and Raymond B. Allen became the first Chancellor of UCLA. However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies, and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as President that UC was able to evolve into a system from 1957 to 1960. In the 21st century, the University of California has 10 campuses, a combined student body of 280,380 students, 21,200 faculty members, 144,000 staff members and over 1.86 million living alumni, as governed by a semi-autonomous Board of Regents. Its tenth and newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005. Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students; one campus, UC San Francisco, enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences.
