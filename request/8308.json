Established with the Lateran Treaty (1929), it is distinct from, yet under full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes). [g] With an area of 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of about 1,000, it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population. The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377, they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Holy See dates back to early Christianity, and is the primate episcopal see of the Catholic Church, with 1.3 billion Catholic Christians around the world distributed in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches. The independent Vatican City-state, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation, not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756\u20131870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy.",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent. However, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area).

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain, and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9, meli, honey. The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 (Melit\u0113) meaning honey-sweet, possibly for Malta's unique production of honey; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island. The Romans called the island Melita, which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1. In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin. Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized (King James) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901. Malta is widely used in more recent versions, such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973.

The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia's Riau Islands, its northern, western, and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia, and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east. It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south, and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east. The country's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets, the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history, modern Singapore, then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate, was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles, a British colonial officer, established a trading post of the East India Company on the island. In 1824, the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate, and in 1826, Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements, a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula. From 1830 to 1858, the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company's Bengal Presidency; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj.",
  "/wiki/Microstate": "A microstate or ministate is a sovereign state having a very small population or very small land area, and usually both. The meanings of state and very small are not well-defined in international law. Recent attempts, since 2010, to define microstates have focused on identifying political entities with unique qualitative features linked to their geographic or demographic limitations. According to a qualitative definition, microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints. In line with this and most other definitions, examples of microstates include Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, the Cook Islands, Niue, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is Vatican City, with 842 citizens as of July 2013 and an area of only 44 hectares (110 acres). However, some scholars dispute qualifying Vatican City as a state, arguing that it does not meet the traditional criteria of statehood and that the special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions, and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations."
