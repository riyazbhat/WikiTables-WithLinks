The estimated population in 2007 was 25,505, increasing to 27,445 at the 2011 Census.\n Stratford was originally inhabited by Anglo-Saxons and remained a village before the lord of the manor, John of Coutances, set out plans to develop it into a town in 1196. In that same year, Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town, giving it its status as a market town. As a result, Stratford experienced an increase in trade and commerce as well as urban expansion.\n The town is a popular tourist destination owing to its status as the birthplace and gravesite of playwright and poet William Shakespeare, and receives approximately 2.5 million visitors a year.

M. Synge, No\u00ebl Coward and J. B. Priestley.

The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.

According to the author Peter Thomson, for its first two centuries, Drury Lane could \"reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre\". For most of that time, it was one of a handful of patent theatres, granted monopoly rights to the production of \"legitimate\" drama in London (meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music). The first theatre on the site was built at the behest of Thomas Killigrew in the early 1660s, when theatres were allowed to reopen during the English Restoration. Initially known as \"Theatre Royal in Bridges Street\", the theatre's proprietors hired prominent actors who performed at the theatre on a regular basis, including Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart. In 1672, the theatre caught fire and Killigrew built a larger theatre on the same plot, renamed the \"Theatre Royal in Drury Lane\"; it opened in 1674.",
