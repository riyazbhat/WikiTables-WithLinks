  "/wiki/U.S._Route_209_in_Pennsylvania": "U.S. Route 209 (US 209) is a 211.74-mile (340.76 km) long U.S. Highway in the states of Pennsylvania and New York. Although the route is a spur of US 9, US 209 never intersects US 9, coming within five miles of the route and making the short connection via New York State Route 199 (NY 199). The southern terminus of the route is at Pennsylvania Route 147 (PA 147) in Millersburg, Pennsylvania. The northern terminus is at US 9W north of Kingston in Ulster, New York, where the road continues east as New York State Route 199 (NY 199). US 209 is one of the original highways in the original 1926 U.S. Highway System plan. In Pennsylvania, the highway travels through the length of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, along the middle part of the Lehigh Valley (through Jim Thorpe and along parts of the defunct historic Lehigh Canal and Lehigh Valley Railroad) then over the divide near Nesquehoning into the Schuylkill Valley (along Panther Creek). Similarly, for part of its route in New York, US 209 runs alongside the defunct Delaware and Hudson Canal, which ran from Port Jervis to Kingston, in each case, following the old land road connections connecting the Anthracite fields of Northeastern Pennsylvania with the industries and heating customers in New York City. US 209 was assigned as part of the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926. The route was initially an intrastate highway contained entirely within the state of Pennsylvania. It began at an intersection with US 11 (now US 22 / US 322) in Clarks Ferry (east of Duncannon) and ended at U.S. Route 6 in Milford. US 209 was extended northward to US 9W in Kingston, New York, in April 1935 and truncated to Millersburg, Pennsylvania, by 1938. The portion of US 209 in New York north of Port Jervis was previously designated as US 6 from 1926 to 1928 and U.S. Route 6N from 1928 to 1933.",

  "/wiki/Delaware_and_Hudson_Canal": "The Delaware and Hudson Canal was the first venture of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, which would later build the Delaware and Hudson Railway. Between 1828 and 1899, the canal's barges carried anthracite coal from the mines of Northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River and thence to market in New York City. Construction of the canal involved some major feats of civil engineering, and led to the development of some new technologies, particularly in rail transport. Its operation stimulated the city's growth and encouraged settlement in the sparsely populated region. Unlike many other canals of that era, the canal remained a profitable private operation for most of its existence. For these reasons, the canal was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968. The canal was abandoned in the early 20th century, and much of it was subsequently drained and filled. A few fragments remain in New York and Pennsylvania, and are in use as parks and historic sites.",

The Munsee were speakers of one of the three major language dialects of the Lenape Native American tribe. This interstate territory became the most important Munsee community for the majority of the 17th and 18th centuries. The area has supported human habitation for 10,000 years. The site's archeology has been studied for more than 100 years, since the discovery in 1900 of Native American burials, and Indian and European artifacts. Since the late twentieth century, researchers have concentrated on trying to understand Native American cultures rather than simply retrieve artifacts and antiquities. Today, Minisink remains one of the most extensive, best preserved, and most intensively studied archeological locales in the Northeast. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Excavations at the site have helped reveal historic interactions between European and Lenape people in Munsee country. Hundreds of early stone tools recovered at the site, along with remains of fish and fruit, indicated a more diverse diet than previously expected by researchers.
