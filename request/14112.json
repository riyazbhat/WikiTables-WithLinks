  "/wiki/Algonquin_people": "The Algonquins are indigenous inhabitants of North America who speak the Algonquin language, a divergent dialect of the Ojibwe language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. Culturally and linguistically, they are closely related to the Odawa and Ojibwe, with whom they form the larger Anicin\u00e0pe (Anishinaabe) grouping. The Algonquin people call themselves Om\u00e0miwinini (plural: Om\u00e0miwininiwak) or the more generalised name of Anicin\u00e0pe.\n Though known by several names in the past, such as Algoumequin (at the time of Samuel de Champlain),the most common term \"Algonquin\" has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elak\u00f3mkwik (IPA: [\u025bl\u00e6\u02c8\u0261omo\u0261wik]):  \"they are our relatives/allies\". The much larger heterogeneous group of Algonquian-speaking peoples, who, according to Brian Conwell, stretch from Virginia to the Rocky Mountains and north to Hudson Bay, was named after the tribe.\n Most Algonquins live in Quebec. The nine Algonquin bands in that province and one in Ontario have a combined population of about 11,000. The Algonquin are original natives of southern\nQuebec and eastern Ontario in Canada. Today they live in nine communities in Quebec and one in Ontario. The Algonquin were a small tribe that also lives in northern Michigan and southern Quebec and eastern Ontario. (Popular usage reflects some confusion on the point.  The term \"Algonquin\" is sometimes used, such as in the Catholic Encyclopedia, to refer to all Algonquian-speaking societies, although this is not correct.)\n Many Algonquins still speak the Algonquin language, called generally Anicin\u00e0pemowin or specifically Om\u00e0miwinin\u00ecmowin. The language is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe languages. Among younger speakers, the Algonquin language has experienced strong word borrowings from the Cree language.\nTraditionally, the Algonquins lived in either birch bark or  wooden m\u00eckiw\u00e0ms.  Today Algonquins live in housings like those of the general public.\n Traditionally, the Algonquins were practitioners of Midewiwin (the right path). They  believed they were surrounded by many manit\u00f2k or spirits in the natural world. French missionaries converted many Algonquins to Catholicism in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, many of the people practice traditional Midewiwin or a syncretic merging of Christianity and Midewiwin.\n In the earliest oral history, the Algonquins say they migrated from the Atlantic coast.  Together with other Anicin\u00e0pek, they arrived at the \"First Stopping Place\" near Montreal.  While the other Anicin\u00e0pe peoples continued their journey up the St. Lawrence River, the Algonquins settled along the Kitcis\u00ecpi (Ottawa River), a long-important highway for commerce, cultural exchange and transportation.  Algonquin identity, though, was not fully realized until after the dividing of the Anicin\u00e0pek at the \"Third Stopping Place\".  Scholars have used the oral histories, archeology, and linguistics to estimate this took place about 2000 years ago, near present-day Detroit.\n After contact with the Europeans, especially the French and Dutch, the Algonquin nations became active in the fur trade.  This led them to fight against the powerful Iroquois, whose confederacy was based in present-day New York.  In 1570, the Algonquins formed an alliance with the Montagnais to the east, whose territory extended to the ocean.",
