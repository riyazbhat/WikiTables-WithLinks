  "/wiki/Bear_Creek_Fishweir_No._1": "The Bear Creek Fishweir #1 is a historic fishing weir on Bear Creek in Tishomingo State Park, in northeastern Mississippi.  It consists of a fieldstone dam extending from the south bank of the creek at an angle for about 40 metres (130\u00a0ft), with evidence that a similar but shorter dam extended for some 8 metres (26\u00a0ft) from the north bank.  The two dams formed a V shape with a narrow chute between them.  At that point there is evidence of a 20th-century fish trap constructed of wooden elements, of which only fragments remained.  Its known history is that it was built (or more likely, rebuilt) by William Wiley Leatherwood, whose family maintained the weir.  State law requiring weirs to not impede waterflow was passed in the 1920s, leading to its decreased effectiveness and eventual abandonment.  The weir is one of the best-preserved such structures in northeastern Mississippi, many of the others having been destroyed to improve water flow.",

  "/wiki/Bear_Creek_Fishweir_No._2": "The Bear Creek Fishweir #2 is a historic fishing weir on Bear Creek in Tishomingo State Park, northeastern Mississippi.  The weir consists of a roughly V-shaped stone construction, built from readily available local sandstone.  The walls of the weir meet closer to the western bank of the creek, where they form a chute estimated to be 11 metres (36\u00a0ft) in length.  At the end of the chute there would have been a fish trap of wooden construction, of which no traces remain.  The weir was almost certainly maintained by local residents into the early 20th century, but may have been built on the site of an earlier construction by Native Americans.  This weir, along with Bear Creek Fishweir #1, is one of the best-preserved surviving weirs in northeastern Mississippi.",
