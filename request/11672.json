  "/wiki/Call_sign": "In broadcasting and radio communications, a call sign (also known as a call name or call letters\u2014and historically as a call signal\u2014or abbreviated as a call) is a unique designation for a transmitter station. In the United States of America, they are used for all FCC-licensed transmitters. A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency, informally adopted by individuals or organizations, or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station's identity. The use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad telegraph system. Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad stations, there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram. In order to save time, two-letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose. This pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation; radio companies initially assigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at sea. These were not globally unique, so a one-letter company identifier (for instance, 'M' and two letters as a Marconi station) was later added.",

  "/wiki/Fractional_ownership_of_aircraft": "Fractional Aircraft is a common term for fractional ownership of aircraft where multiple owners share the costs of purchasing, leasing and operating the aircraft. Commercial programs for large aircraft include NetJets, Flexjet, PlaneSense, and AirSprint. With fractional jets, customers (referred to as \"owners\") buy a \"share\" of an aircraft, rather than an entire aircraft. The price is pro-rated from the market price of a full aircraft. Owners then have guaranteed access (for 50\u2013400 hours annually or a certain number of days of the year, depending on share size) to that plane, or a similar plane in the operators fleet, with as little as four hours' notice. Fractional owners pay a monthly maintenance fee and an \"occupied\" hourly operating fee. Usually the latter is charged only when an owner or guest is on board, not when the plane is flying to a pick up point, or returning to its home base after completing a flight. Owners have access to the full fleet of planes and may upgrade or downgrade for specific flights.",
