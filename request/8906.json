  "/wiki/1977_NCAA_Division_I_football_season": "The 1977 NCAA Division I football season was one in which the top five teams finished with 11\u20131 records.  Notre Dame, which beat top-ranked and undefeated Texas in the Cotton Bowl, became the national champion.\n The 1977 season was the last before NCAA's Division I was divided into I-A and I-AA.  On the eve of a national playoff for the smaller programs that would be I-AA, the Sugar Bowl in 1977 became the fourth bowl game to sign a contract guaranteeing an appearance by a major conference champion. The result was that meetings between the media poll choices for the top two teams were less likely, unless those teams were in the Big Ten and Pac-8 (which met in the Rose Bowl), or one of the teams was not obligated to play in a particular bowl game.\n Besides the Big Ten-Pac-8 matchup in the Rose Bowl, the Southwest champion played in the Cotton, the Big Eight titlist in the Orange, and the SEC champ in the Sugar.  Top teams that had their choice of which bowl to play were either independent or in a conference outside the five major powers (such as the ACC or WAC).\n During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for major college football teams, which became Division I-A in 1978. The NCAA Football Guide, however, did note an \"unofficial national champion\" based on the top ranked teams in the final \"wire service\" (AP and UPI) polls.  The \"writers' poll\" by Associated Press (AP) was the most popular, followed by the \"coaches' poll\" by United Press International) (UPI).  The AP poll consisted of the votes of as many as 64 writers, though not all voted in each poll, and the UPI poll was taken of a 42-member board of coaches.",
  "/wiki/1978_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 1978 NCAA Division I-A football season was the first season of Division I-A college football; Division I-A was created in 1978 when Division I was subdivided into Division I-A and Division I-AA for football only. With the exception of seven teams from the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), Division I teams from the 1977 season played in Division I-A during the 1978 season. The SWAC teams, along with five conferences and five other teams formerly in Division II, played in Division I-AA.\n The Division I-A season came down to a rare #1 vs. #2 post-season meeting as #1 Penn State and #2 Alabama met in the New Year's Day Sugar Bowl. The game is most remembered for Alabama's goal line stand with four minutes left in the game. On fourth down and a foot, Alabama managed to keep Penn State out of the end zone and went on to win, 14\u20137. Keith Jackson, who did the play by play for ABC, called it the greatest game he'd ever seen. 76,824 people packed the Louisiana Superdome, which was tremendously loud.\n Alabama's only loss that year was 24\u201314 in Birmingham to USC. Both schools claim this year as a national title year.  Alabama claimed the national title because it defeated top-ranked Penn State on the field.  USC claimed the title because it defeated Alabama in the regular season and also finished with only one loss.  The AP Poll and most other voting outlets (including the Football Writers Association of America and the National Football Foundation) crowned Alabama as national champion, while the UPI Coaches' Poll selected USC.",

He played college football at Ball State.\n After his NFL career, Kremer became a sports agent.",
  "/wiki/1979_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 1979 NCAA Division I-A football season saw the Alabama Crimson Tide bring home a national title with a perfect 12-0 season. The title was Alabama's 11th claimed, and their 6th Associated Press awarded title.\n This was an extremely dominant Alabama team, only giving up 67 points the entire season and shutting out five opponents.  The team won a tight game against LSU 3-0 and beat Auburn by a touchdown before beating Arkansas 24-9 in the Sugar Bowl.\n There was very little movement at the top of the rankings throughout the season, as only three different teams held the top spot in the AP poll and only two in the UPI poll. USC was the pre-season top-ranked team, and held the number one ranking until a 21\u201321 tie with Stanford, a game USC led at halftime 21\u20130. A fumbled hold on the snap from center cost the Trojans a chance at a last-second field goal. Stanford was led by quarterback Turk Schonert, while freshman John Elway served as his backup. USC  ended up finishing second in the country, but running back Charles White brought home the Heisman Trophy.\n Number 2 Alabama then took over the top spot and never relinquished that position in the UPI poll. In the AP poll, however, Ohio State took over the top spot in the last regular season poll of the season. Ohio State had defeated #13 Michigan in Ann Arbor by a score of 18\u201315 to earn the Big Ten title. Two weeks later, Alabama defeated #14 Auburn 25-18 in Birmingham, but the AP voters saw fit to jump Ohio State ahead of them.\n Thus, Ohio State came within one point of a national title under first-year coach Earle Bruce, who replaced coach Woody Hayes, falling to USC 17\u201316 in the Rose Bowl after an undefeated season.",

  "/wiki/1980_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season": "The 1980 NCAA Division I-A football season saw a university from the state of Georgia take its first national title since 1942.\n Nine days following the bowl games to close the 1979 season, tragedy struck when new LSU coach Bo Rein died when the plane he was flying in crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia. Rein, who coached North Carolina State to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in 1979, was named on November 30 of that year as the successor to Charles McClendon, who coached LSU to a 137-59-7 mark from 1962 through 1979. Jerry Stovall, a former LSU All-American and St. Louis Cardinals defensive back, was named to succeed Rein approximately 36 hours after the crash.\n The Georgia Bulldogs starred freshman running back Herschel Walker, who made his NCAA debut against Tennessee.  Down 15-2 at halftime, Georgia sent in Walker, the third string running back at the time, to try to light a spark.  Walker ran over All-American safety Bill Bates, in a play that would set the tempo for the rest of his career.\n This year was the final season in which long time rivals Rutgers and Princeton played against each other. The rivalry between the New Jersey schools has not been played since.\n This year's edition of Florida\u2013Georgia game was won on a last minute 92 yard pass from Georgia's own endzone, known by the play by play call \"Run, Lindsay, run!\".\n The Bulldogs ran through the rest of the season unscathed, beating Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl.  Walker rushed for 150 yards against Notre Dame, a defense which had not given up a hundred-yard game that whole season. He did this with a dislocated shoulder.\n The Pittsburgh Panthers also had a stellar season, led by defensive end Hugh Green.  The team went 11-1 and finished ranked #2, finishing the season with a rout of South Carolina and Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers in the Gator Bowl. 29 players from this team went on the play in the NFL.\n Florida State defeated #3 ranked Nebraska on the Cornhuskers' home turf, and the following week defeated the #2 ranked Pitt Panthers\n It was an unusual year for the Pac-10 as 5 of its 10 members were placed on probation by the conference (but not the NCAA) including traditional powers USC and UCLA, along with both Oregon schools and Arizona State. So half the conference was ineligible for bowl games and it was feared that the 4th or 5th-place finisher would end up in the Rose Bowl. Ironically,  USC and UCLA both got as high as #2 in the polls before being upset. As it turned out, the probation didn't matter as Washington won the conference outright with a 6-1 record.\n This year's edition of the Holiday Bowl was a classic as the BYU staged a fourth quarter comeback, led by future NFL star Jim McMahon. Down 45-25 to SMU with less than four minutes left, McMahon threw three touchdown passes, including a Hail Mary as time expired, caught in the endzone by Clay Brown, despite being surrounded by three SMU defenders.",

It was Joe Paterno's first national championship, after three undefeated non-championship seasons.\nUCLA moved from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the Rose Bowl and fulfilled a promise made by coach Terry Donahue by closing out their season there as well, beating Michigan 24\u201314 in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.\n It is also the year of \"The Play\", an improbable finish to the annual rivalry game between Cal and Stanford.\n The Aloha Bowl premiered in Honolulu, Hawaii, and was won by Washington.",

Miami came into the game ranked #5, but losses by #2 Texas in the Cotton Bowl and #4 Illinois in the Rose Bowl launched them to #1 (despite protests from #3 Auburn, who played the toughest schedule in the nation that year).\n Nebraska scored a touchdown with 48 seconds remaining, putting them within one point of the Hurricanes.  Despite knowing a tie would still give Nebraska the national title, Coach Tom Osborne decided to go for two points and the win rather than one point and the tie.  Miami was able to hold, snapping Nebraska's 22-game winning streak and launching Miami as a powerhouse program.\n This Miami team was the first to win a national title without a single player voted to the first team All-Americans and only the second to win a national title gaining more passing yards than rushing.\n The Auburn Tigers, featuring Bo Jackson also had a stellar season going 11-1 and beating Michigan in the Sugar Bowl 9\u20137. Despite entering the bowl games ranked third in both major polls, and with both teams ranked higher losing their bowl games, the Tigers ended ranked third in the final AP poll as Miami jumped from 5th to ranked #1 when they beat #1 ranked Nebraska to gain the National Championship. Auburn had played the toughest schedule in the nation, including eight bowl teams, seven of which were ranked in the top 20 (four in the top ten). Even with this difficult schedule the Tigers were ranked first by a few polls, including The New York Times computer rankings. The NCAA record book also formally recognizes the Tigers as co-national champions, along with Nebraska (and Miami). It is not uncommon for the NCAA record book to \"recognize\" multiple national champions in a given year, with the AP and Coaches' poll winner regarded as national champions.\n The Holiday Bowl was also a classic, as Brigham Young University, led by future NFL star Steve Young, defeated Missouri with a last second halfback pass.\n The annual rivalry game between Oregon and Oregon State is still widely known and derided as \"The Toilet Bowl\", as the teams played to a 0\u20130 tie, the last scoreless tie in college football. The game featured 11 total turnovers, as 6 fumbles were lost (out of 11 total), 5 interceptions, and 4 missed field goals.\n This season saw no conference have two or more teams tie for the title\u2014an event that did not happen again in either Division I-A or its successor, Division I FBS, until 2009. (Note, however, that even when a conference officially recognizes multiple champions, it will invariably have some kind of tiebreaker system to determine placement for bowl berths.)",
