  "/wiki/List_of_Scottish_football_champions": "The Scottish football champions are the winners of the highest league in Scottish football, namely the Scottish Football League (SFL) from 1890 until 1998, the Scottish Premier League (SPL) from 1998 until 2013 and the Scottish Premiership thereafter. The SFL was established in 1890, initially as an amateur league until professionalism in Scottish football was  legalised in 1893. At the end of the first season Dumbarton and Rangers finished level on points at the top of the table. The rules in force at the time required that the teams contest a play-off match for the championship, which finished in a 2\u20132 draw, and the first ever championship was thus shared between two clubs, the only occasion on which this has happened. In 1893 a Second Division was formed, with the existing single division renamed the First Division. The league continued during the First World War but was suspended during the Second World War. Although there were several short spells when a third division was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up and the creation of a new Premier Division at the highest level. In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as the highest level of football in Scotland.",

This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984\u201385, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy.
