  "/wiki/Green_Arrow": "Green Arrow is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics.

Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows (in contemporary times, they are referred as \"specialty arrows\") with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations.
