In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World. Virginia's state nickname, the Old Dominion, is a reference to this status. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution. In the American Civil War, Virginia's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy, and Virginia's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union; that led to the creation of West Virginia.

  "/wiki/San_Diego": "San Diego (/\u02ccs\u00e6n di\u02c8e\u026a\u0261o\u028a/, Spanish: [san \u02c8dje\u0263o]; Spanish for Saint Didacus) is a city in the U.S. state of California on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, approximately 120 miles (190 km) south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico. With an estimated population of 1,425,976 as of July 1, 2018, San Diego is the eighth-largest city in the United States and second-largest in California. It is part of the San Diego-Tijuana conurbation, the second-largest transborder agglomeration between the U.S. and a bordering country after Detroit-Windsor, with a population of 4,922,723 people. The city is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center. San Diego has been called the birthplace of California. Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, it was the first site visited by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States. Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California became part of the United States in 1848 following the Mexican-American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850. The city is the seat of San Diego County and is the economic center of the region as well as the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area. San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, and manufacturing.",

  "/wiki/Dahlberg_Arena": "Dahlberg Arena is a 7,321-seat multi-purpose arena in the western United States, located on the campus of the University of Montana in Missoula. The arena opened 67 years ago in 1953 and is home to the Montana Grizzlies and Lady Griz basketball teams. It has hosted the Big Sky Conference men's basketball tournament five times: 1978, 1991, 1992, 2000, and 2012. Opened in late 1953, the field house was named for newly-retired track coach Harry Adams in June 1966. In the 1980s, Adams Field House seated over 9,000 and was known as the toughest arena for visiting teams in the Big Sky, and also enjoyed a national reputation. Its laminated wood arches were constructed in Portland, Oregon. The elevation of the floor is approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) above sea level. Alumnus George P. (Jiggs) Dahlberg (1900-1993) was head coach of the Grizzlies from 1937 to 1955 and retired as athletic director in 1961. He was one of four brothers known as The Four Norseman of Butte who competed in athletics for the Griz. The arena can be configured to seat 5,500 people for a traditionally staged concert or can use all of the seats for a concert with a central stage. It has hosted many concerts, including Pearl Jam, Grateful Dead, Gym Class Heroes, Rascal Flatts, and Macklemore.",
  "/wiki/Missoula,_Montana": "Missoula /m\u026a\u02c8zu\u02d0l\u0259/ (listen) is a city in the U.S. state of Montana and is the county seat of Missoula County. It is located along the Clark Fork River near its confluences with the Bitterroot and Blackfoot Rivers in western Montana and at the convergence of five mountain ranges, thus it is often described as the hub of five valleys. In 2018[update], the United States Census Bureau estimated the city's population at 74,428 and the population of the Missoula Metropolitan Area at 118,791. After Billings, Missoula is both the second largest city and metropolitan area in Montana. Missoula is home to the University of Montana, a public research university. William T. Hamilton first settled in the Missoula area in 1858 with a trading post near current Missoula along the Rattlesnake Creek along with Captain Richard Grant settling near Grant Creek, and David Pattee near Pattee Canyon. Missoula was founded in 1860 as Hellgate Trading Post while still part of Washington Territory. By 1866, the settlement had moved east, 5 miles (8 km) upstream, and renamed Missoula Mills, later shortened to Missoula. The mills provided supplies to western settlers traveling along the Mullan Road. The establishment of Fort Missoula in 1877 to protect settlers further stabilized the economy. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883 brought rapid growth and the maturation of the local lumber industry. In 1893, the Montana Legislature chose the city as the site for the state's first university.",
