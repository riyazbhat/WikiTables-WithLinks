  "/wiki/Norton_Motorcycle_Company": "The Norton Motorcycle Company (formerly Norton Motors, Ltd.) is an English motorcycle marque, originally from Birmingham, England, UK. It was founded in 1898 as a manufacturer of \"fittings and parts for the two-wheel trade\". By 1902 the company had begun manufacturing motorcycles with bought-in engines. In 1908 a Norton-built engine was added to the range. This began a long series of production of single and eventually twin-cylinder motorcycles, and a long history of racing involvement. During the Second World War Norton produced almost 100,000 of the military Model 16\u00a0H and Big\u00a04 sidevalve motorcycles.\n When major shareholders started to leave Norton in 1953 the company declined and Associated Motor Cycles bought the shares.\nAlthough motorcycle sales went through a recession in the 1950s, and Norton Motors Ltd was only a small manufacturer, Norton sales flourished. A series of Norton Dominator Twins of 500\u00a0cc, then 600\u00a0cc, then 650\u00a0cc and then the 750\u00a0cc Norton Atlas kept sales buoyant, especially with sales to the United States.\n In 1968 the new 750\u00a0cc Norton Commando Model appeared, with the engine/gearbox/swingarm unit isolastically insulated from the frame with a series of rubber mountings. This kept the vibrations from the rider, giving a smooth comfortable ride. The Commando was a best seller, and voted #1 Motorcycle of the Year a number of times in Britain. 850\u00a0cc models appeared for 1973, giving more torque. For 1975 an electric start arrived in the 850 Mk3.\n The largest UK motorcycle manufacturer at the time was BSA-Triumph, comprising Birmingham Small Arms Company in Birmingham, and Triumph Motorcycles in Meriden. BSA-Triumph faced difficulties caused by poor management, outdated union practices, old-fashioned motorcycle designs and antiquated factory conditions. A merger with Norton Motorcycles was proposed; but although Dennis Poore's Norton Motorcycles was by far the smaller partner, Poore effectively secured a take-over of BSA-Triumph, forming Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT). The Triumph factory Meriden was the least modern; but workers engaged in a \"sit-in\", forming a workers' co-operative. Poore was CEO of Manganese Bronze Holdings, a company apparently more concerned with asset stripping than with motorcycle production. Subsequent political manoeuvrings led to the downfall of NVT, as taxpayer-assisted wranglings over amalgamations and sell-offs all but killed the once extensive UK motorcycle industry.\n In late 2008, Stuart Garner, a UK businessman, bought the rights to Norton from some US concerns and relaunched Norton in its Midlands home at Donington Park where it was to develop the 961cc Norton Commando and a new range of Norton motorcycles. \n On 29 January 2020, it was announced that the company had gone into administration. Administrators BDO were appointed by Metro Bank. The company had been in court over \u00a3300,000 of unpaid taxes due to HM Revenue and Customs, from an original amount of \u00a3600,000, with company representatives stating that \u00a3135,000 in \"outstanding research and development tax relief\" was overdue and would substantially reduce the amount owed. HMRC gave the company more time to pay and the court case was adjourned until mid-February. There were reports that there had been fraudulent wrongdoing which affected hundreds of pension holders who invested in the company, Norton customers, and staff; government ministers had endorsed Norton as millions of pounds of government grants and loans were provided. An associated business owned by Stuart Garner, the nearby Priest House Hotel, is also in administration, being run temporarily by an outside hotel chain.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing_World_Constructors_champions": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing is the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, which has been divided into three classes: MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3. Classes that have been discontinued include 500cc, 350cc, 250cc, 125cc, 80cc, 50cc and Sidecar.  The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship.\n There were five classes when the championship started in 1949; 500cc, 350cc, 250cc, 125cc and sidecar (600cc). The 50cc class was introduced in 1962. Due to escalating costs that resulted in a number of manufacturers leaving the championship, the FIM limited the 50cc bikes to a single cylinder, the 125cc and 250cc bikes were limited to two cylinders and the 350cc and 500cc bikes were limited to four cylinders. The 350cc class was discontinued in 1982, two years later the 50cc class was replaced with an 80cc class, which was discontinued in 1989. The sidecar class left the series to form its own championship after 1996. In 2002, 990cc four stroke engined bikes replaced the 500cc bikes and the class was renamed as MotoGP. 600cc four-stroke bikes replaced the 250cc bikes in 2010, with the class rebranded as Moto2. Since 2012, the Moto3 class (250cc four-stroke one cylinder) replaced the 125cc class.\n The 750cc was never part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing series.\n The Constructors' World Championship is awarded to the most successful constructor over a season, as determined by a points system based on Grand Prix results. Only the highest-scoring rider in each race for each constructor contributing points towards the Championship. The winner of the constructors' world championship is not necessarily the bike used by the riders' world champion. For example, in 2004, Valentino Rossi who rode a Yamaha bike won the riders' world championship, but in the constructors' standings, Honda have higher points than Yamaha, therefore Honda won constructors' world championship.\n For the sidecar class, the constructors championship went to the engine manufacturer, not the chassis manufacturer.  For the Moto2 class, the championship goes to the chassis manufacturer, not the engine manufacturer, since all competitors are required to use spec engines provided by Honda (Triumph for 2019 onwards)."
