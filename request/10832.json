  "/wiki/Small_satellite": "A small satellite, miniaturized satellite, or smallsat is a satellite of low mass and size, usually under 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb). While all such satellites can be referred to as \"small\", different classifications are used to categorize them based on mass. Satellites can be built small to reduce the large economic cost of launch vehicles and the costs associated with construction.  Miniature satellites, especially in large numbers, may be more useful than fewer, larger ones for some purposes \u2013 for example, gathering of scientific data and radio relay.  Technical challenges in the construction of small satellites may include the lack of sufficient power storage or of room for a propulsion system.",

It is a plasma propulsion engine, one of several types of spacecraft electric propulsion systems.",
  "/wiki/Plasma_propulsion_engine": "A plasma propulsion engine is a type of electric propulsion that generates thrust from a quasi-neutral plasma. This is in contrast to ion thruster engines, which generate thrust through extracting an ion current from the plasma source, which is then accelerated to high velocities using grids/anodes. These exist in many forms (see electric propulsion). \nPlasma thrusters do not typically use high voltage grids or anodes/ cathodes to accelerate the charged particles in the plasma, but rather uses currents and potentials which are generated internally in the plasma to accelerate the plasma ions. While this results in a lower exhaust velocity by virtue of the lack of high accelerating voltages, this type of thruster has a number of advantages. The lack of high voltage grids of anodes removes a possible limiting element as a result of grid ion erosion. The plasma exhaust is 'quasi-neutral', which means that ion and electrons exist in equal number, which allows simply ion-electron recombination in the exhaust to neutralise the exhaust plume, removing the need for an electron gun (hollow cathode). This type of thruster often generates the source plasma using radio frequency or microwave energy, using an external antenna. This fact, combined with the absence of hollow cathodes (which are very sensitive to all but the few noble gases) allows the intriguing possibility of being able to use this type of thruster on a huge range of propellants, from argon, to carbon dioxide, air mixtures, to astronaut urine.",
