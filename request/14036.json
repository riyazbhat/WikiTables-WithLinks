  "/wiki/Mount_John_University_Observatory": "University of Canterbury Mount John Observatory (UCMJO), previously known as Mt John University Observatory (MJUO), is New Zealand's premier astronomical research observatory. It is situated at 1,029 metres (3,376\u00a0ft) ASL atop Mount John at the northern end of the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island, and was established in 1965. There are many telescopes on site including: one 0.4-meter, two 0.6-meter, one 1.0-meter, and a new 1.8-meter \"MOA Telescope\" (see details below). The nearest population center is the resort town Lake Tekapo (pop.\u2009<500). Approximately 20% of nights at MJUO are photometric, with a larger number available for spectroscopic work and direct imaging photometry.\n UCMJO is operated by the University of Canterbury, and is the home of HERCULES (High Efficiency and Resolution Canterbury University Large Echelle Spectrograph), and the observational wing of the Japanese/New Zealand MOA collaboration (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics) led by Professor Yasushi Muraki of Nagoya University. A Japanese funded, 1.8-meter telescope is now in place and will be used initially by the MOA Project, before handover to the University of Canterbury at the conclusion of the MOA Project in 2012.\n In June 2012 an area of 430,000 hectares (1,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) around the observatory was declared as the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association, one of only four such reserves around the world. The area has a Bortle Scale of 2.",
  "/wiki/Kitt_Peak": "Kitt Peak (O'odham: Ioligam) is a mountain in the U.S. state of Arizona, and at 6,883 feet (2,098\u00a0m) is the highest point in the Quinlan Mountains. It is the location of the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The radio telescope at the Observatory is one of ten dishes comprising the Very Long Baseline Array radio telescope.\n The peak was named in English by County Surveyor George J. Roskruge for his sister, Phillippa, who was the wife of William F. Kitt. On his 1893 Pima County Survey map, Roskruge spelled the name 'Kits'. At the request of the wife of George F. Kitt, the spelling was changed by decision in 1930.\n Kitt Peak is the second-highest peak on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, and as such is the second-most sacred after Baboquivari Peak.  Near the summit is I'itoi's Garden, the summer residence of the nation's elder brother deity.  The name Ioligam means \"red stick\" in reference to the abundance of manzanita bushes on and around the mountain.",

  "/wiki/Haute-Provence_Observatory": "The Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP, French: Observatoire de Haute-Provence) is an astronomical observatory in the southeast of France, about 90\u00a0km east of Avignon and 100\u00a0km north of Marseille. It was established in 1937 as a national facility for French astronomers.  Astronomical observations began in 1943 using the 1.20 m telescope, and the first research papers based on observations made at the observatory were published in 1944.  Foreign observers first used the observatory in 1949, when Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge visited.\n The observatory lies at an altitude of about 650 m, on a plateau near the village of Saint-Michel-l'Observatoire in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence d\u00e9partement at 43\u00b055\u203251\u2033N 5\u00b042\u203248\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.93083\u00b0N 5.71333\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.93083; 5.71333Coordinates: 43\u00b055\u203251\u2033N 5\u00b042\u203248\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.93083\u00b0N 5.71333\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.93083; 5.71333.\n The site was chosen for an observatory because of its generally very favourable observing conditions.  On average, 60% of nights are suitable for astronomical observations, with the best seasons are Summer and Autumn.  About 170 nights per year on average are completely cloudless.  The seeing is usually around 2\" but can reach 1\" or lower on occasion. Seeing degrades severely, sometimes to over 10\", when the cold Mistral wind blows from the northwest.  This happens on about 45 days per year on average, mostly during winter.  Good weather conditions often follow a Mistral. On average, atmospheric absorption at OHP is roughly twice that seen at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at La Silla, Chile.\n The main-belt asteroid 7755 Haute-Provence, discovered by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst in 1989, was named for the region where the discovering observatory is located.",

  "/wiki/Dark-sky_preserve": "A dark-sky preserve (DSP) is an area, usually surrounding a park or observatory, that restricts artificial light pollution. The purpose of a dark sky preserve is generally to promote astronomy. Because different national organizations have worked independently to create their programs, different terms have been used to describe the areas. This has led to confusion between the terms reserve, preserve, and park. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) chooses reserve to avoid confusion with park, when using the initialisms \"IDSR\" (International Dark Sky Reserve) and \"IDSP\" (International Dark Sky Park).\n In 1993, Michigan became the first state in the United States to designate a tract of land as a \"Dark Sky Preserve\" at the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area.\n In 1999, the first permanent preserve was established at Torrance Barrens in the Muskoka region of southern Ontario. Nevertheless, protection zones around observatories existed well before the creation of that preserve.\n The IDA recognizes protected areas worldwide. The Mont M\u00e9gantic Observatory in Quebec is the first such site to be recognized (in 2007) as International Dark Sky Reserve.\nIDA has also recognized Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah as the world's first International Dark Sky Park.\n Canada has established an extensive standard for dark sky preserves that addresses lighting within the DSP and influences from skyglow from urban areas in the region. This was based on the work of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. There are no other established standards for dark sky preserves. Outside Canada, such designations are generally through self-proclamation. As a result, the validity of such a designation may be dubious. In some cases, dark sky preserves are neither dark nor protected.\n It is generally understood that a Dark Sky Preserve, or Dark Sky Reserve, should be sufficiently dark to promote astronomy. However this is not always the case. The lighting protocol for a Dark Sky Preserve is based on the sensitivity of wildlife to artificial light at night (ALAN).\n In 2015, the IDA introduced the term \"Dark Sky Sanctuary\" and designated the Elqui Valley of northern Chile as the world's first International Dark Sky Sanctuary. The Gabriela Mistral Dark Sky Sanctuary is named after a Chilean poet."
