  "/wiki/Rupes_Altai": "Rupes Altai is an escarpment in the lunar surface that is located in the southeastern quadrant of the Moon's near side. It is named for the Altai Mountains in Asia, and is the most prominent lunar escarpment.

  "/wiki/Altai_Mountains": "The Altai Mountains (/\u0251\u02d0l\u02c8ta\u026a/), also spelled Altay Mountains, are a mountain range in Central and East Asia, where Russia, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan come together, and where the rivers Irtysh and Ob have their headwaters. The massif merges with the Sayan Mountains in the northeast, and gradually becomes lower in the southeast, where it merges into the high plateau of the Gobi Desert. It spans from about 45\u00b0 to 52\u00b0 N and from about 84\u00b0 to 99\u00b0 E.",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Boris": "Rupes Boris is a short fault or ridge in the lunar surface that is located in the northwestern quadrant of the Moon's near side, within Mare Imbrium. Its name was adopted in 1985 by the International Astronomical Union, and was taken from the tiny nearby crater Boris. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 30\u00b030\u2032N 33\u00b030\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff30.5\u00b0N 33.5\u00b0W\ufeff / 30.5; -33.5, and it has a length of just 4\u00a0km.",
  "/wiki/Boris_(crater)": "Boris is a tiny lunar impact crater that is located on the Mare Imbrium, to the northeast of the crater Delisle. It lies near the southwest extremity of a sinuous rille that is designated Rima Delisle. This rille meanders to the northeast, towards the crater Heis, before vanishing into the lunar mare. The name Boris is a common Russian male given name; the crater is not named after a specific person.",

It faces southwest, and rises about 200\u2013300 m. It is located in the northeastern portion of the Mare Tranquillitatis, and is named after the nearby crater Cauchy.",
  "/wiki/Cauchy_(crater)": "Cauchy is a small lunar impact crater on the eastern Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy. It is circular and symmetric, with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. Due to the high albedo of this bowl-shaped formation, it is particularly prominent at full Moon.",

It is 86 km long. It takes its name from Promontorium Kelvin, which was named after the Irish scientist, physicist and engineer William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin.",
  "/wiki/Liebig_(crater)": "Liebig is a lunar impact crater that is located to the south-southeast of the crater Mersenius, and west of the Mare Humorum in the southwest part of the Moon. To the southwest of Liebig is the slightly smaller crater de Gasparis.",
  "/wiki/Mercator_(crater)": "Mercator is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southwestern edge of Mare Nubium, in the southwest part of the Moon.

  "/wiki/Toscanelli_(crater)": "Toscanelli is a tiny, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the prominent crater Aristarchus, in the northwestern part of the Moon. The crater lies at the southern end of a rille that proceeds towards the north. This rille is part of a nearby system that has the designation Rimae Aristarchus. Just to the south of Toscanelli is a fault line in the surface named the Rupes Toscanelli, after the crater. This break in the surface continues to the south for a distance of about 70 kilometers."
