  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere.\n In more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius r.",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Altai": "Rupes Altai is an escarpment in the lunar surface that is located in the southeastern quadrant of the Moon's near side. It is named for the Altai Mountains in Asia, and is the most prominent lunar escarpment. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 24\u00b018\u2032S 22\u00b036\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff24.3\u00b0S 22.6\u00b0E\ufeff / -24.3; 22.6, and it has a length of about 427 km.\n The southeastern end of the cliff terminates along the western edge of the crater Piccolomini. It then arcs irregularly towards the north, climbing to heights of nearly a kilometer. The northern end of the arc is an irregular region with no clearly defined terminus, where it brackets the prominent craters Theophilus, Cyrillus, and Catharina. This cliff forms the southwestern rim of the Nectaris impact basin.\n This feature is difficult to locate during the full moon when the sunlight is nearly overhead. It appears as a bright, winding line about five days after the new moon, and casts a long, irregular shadow about four days after the full moon, when the sunset terminator is nearby and the sunlight is arriving at a low angle.",
  "/wiki/Altai_Mountains": "The Altai Mountains (/\u0251\u02d0l\u02c8ta\u026a/), also spelled Altay Mountains, are a mountain range in Central and East Asia, where Russia, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan come together, and where the rivers Irtysh and Ob have their headwaters. The massif merges with the Sayan Mountains in the northeast, and gradually becomes lower in the southeast, where it merges into the high plateau of the Gobi Desert. It spans from about 45\u00b0 to 52\u00b0 N and from about 84\u00b0 to 99\u00b0 E.\n The region is inhabited by a sparse but ethnically diverse population, including Russians, Kazakhs, Altais, and Mongolians. The local economy is based on bovine, sheep, and horse husbandry, agriculture, forestry, and mining. The now-disputed Altaic language family takes its name from this mountain range.",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Boris": "Rupes Boris is a short fault or ridge in the lunar surface that is located in the northwestern quadrant of the Moon's near side, within Mare Imbrium. Its name was adopted in 1985 by the International Astronomical Union, and was taken from the tiny nearby crater Boris. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 30\u00b030\u2032N 33\u00b030\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff30.5\u00b0N 33.5\u00b0W\ufeff / 30.5; -33.5, and it has a length of just 4 km.\n It has been proposed that Rupes Boris is not actually a lunar escarpment, but may be a ridge of ejecta from the nearby crater Delisle.",
  "/wiki/Boris_(crater)": "Boris is a tiny lunar impact crater that is located on the Mare Imbrium, to the northeast of the crater Delisle. It lies near the southwest extremity of a sinuous rille that is designated Rima Delisle. This rille meanders to the northeast, towards the crater Heis, before vanishing into the lunar mare. The name Boris is a common Russian male given name; the crater is not named after a specific person.",
  "/wiki/Rupes_Cauchy": "Rupes Cauchy is a 120 km-long escarpment at 9\u00b000\u2032N 37\u00b000\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff9.0\u00b0N 37.0\u00b0E\ufeff / 9.0; 37.0 on the surface of the Moon. It faces southwest, and rises about 200\u2013300 m. It is located in the northeastern portion of the Mare Tranquillitatis, and is named after the nearby crater Cauchy.\n The east end of Rupes Cauchy emerges from the highlands on the eastern margin of Mare Tranquillitatis.  The 3.6 km diameter crater Cauchy C intersects the Rupes due south of Cauchy crater itself.  Cauchy E and F lie to the north side of the Rupes, and Cauchy B lies on the south side.  At the west end of the Rupes are two similar-sized elongate depressions (unlikely to be impact craters).  Between Cauchy B and the depressions the Rupes form an en echelon pattern, similar to that of veins within rock on earth, on a grand scale.  The similar-sized craters Sinas J and H lie to the west of the depressions.\n Rupes Cauchy casts a thin shadow about five days after the new moon, when the sunrise terminator is nearby and the sunlight is arriving at a low angle.\n The feature name is shown as \"Fossa Casals\" on a 1974 map based on Apollo 15 photographs, but the name was not approved by the IAU.",
  "/wiki/Cauchy_(crater)": "Cauchy is a small lunar impact crater on the eastern Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy. It is circular and symmetric, with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. Due to the high albedo of this bowl-shaped formation, it is particularly prominent at full Moon.\n Cauchy lies between the Rupes Cauchy and the Rimae Cauchy, as described below.\n South of Rupes Cauchy are two lunar domes designated Omega (\u03c9) Cauchy and Tau (\u03c4) Cauchy. They lie to the south and southwest of Cauchy respectively. Each lunar dome has a small depression at its crest, which is likely to be a volcanic vent rather than an impact crater.  The vent at the top of Omega Cauchy is called Donna.",

It is 86 km long. It takes its name from Promontorium Kelvin, which was named after the Irish scientist, physicist and engineer William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin.",
  "/wiki/Liebig_(crater)": "Liebig is a lunar impact crater that is located to the south-southeast of the crater Mersenius, and west of the Mare Humorum in the southwest part of the Moon. To the southwest of Liebig is the slightly smaller crater de Gasparis.\n The rim of Liebig has a low inner wall, with an interior floor that is nearly featureless except for a few tiny craterlets. It is nearly, but not quite circular, with outward bulges to the west and southeast. The small, cup-shaped crater Liebig A lies along the inner wall and part of the interior floor.\n The western edge of the Mare Humorum is a fault line designated the Rupes Liebig, named after this crater. This fault extends for about 180 km along the shore. To the southwest, in the section of lava-flooded surface between Liebig and de Gasparis, is a system of rilles named the Rimae de Gasparis. These cover an area with a diameter of 130 km.",
  "/wiki/Mercator_(crater)": "Mercator is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southwestern edge of Mare Nubium, in the southwest part of the Moon. It was named after 16th-century Southern Dutch cartographer Gerardus Mercator. It is located to the southeast of the crater Campanus, and the two are separated by a narrow, winding valley.\n The Rupes Mercator fault is tangential with the northeastern outer rim of Mercator. The eastern edge of Palus Epidemiarum reaches the west rim of Mercator, and a rille from the Rimae Ramsden reaches the western rim at the site of the craterlet Mercator C.\n The rim of Mercator is only somewhat eroded, and several tiny craterlets lie on the west and eastern rims. The interior floor has been flooded by lava in the past, leaving a relatively smooth and featureless surface.",

The name is Latin for straight cliff, although it is more commonly called the Straight Wall. This is the most well-known escarpment on the Moon, and is a popular target for amateur astronomers.",
  "/wiki/Latin": "Latin (Latin: lingua lat\u012bna, IPA: [\u02c8l\u026a\u014b\u0261\u02b7a la\u02c8ti\u02d0na]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet.\n Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome, known as Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire. Latin has contributed many words to the English language. In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek) roots are used in English descriptions of theology, the sciences, medicine, and law.\n By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius. Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages, such as French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries. Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin. Later, Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved. Latin was used as the language of international communication, scholarship and science until well into the 18th century, when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars (including the Romance languages). Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church.\n Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders, up to seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects and two numbers.",
  "/wiki/Toscanelli_(crater)": "Toscanelli is a tiny, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the prominent crater Aristarchus, in the northwestern part of the Moon. The crater lies at the southern end of a rille that proceeds towards the north. This rille is part of a nearby system that has the designation Rimae Aristarchus. Just to the south of Toscanelli is a fault line in the surface named the Rupes Toscanelli, after the crater. This break in the surface continues to the south for a distance of about 70 kilometers.",
