  "/wiki/Nickel": "Nickel is a chemical element with the symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel\u2013iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.",

  "/wiki/IBM_726": "The IBM 726 was IBM's first magnetic tape unit. It was a dual magnetic tape reader/recorder developed for use with the IBM 701 and announced on May 21, 1952. This model of tape unit was shipped with the IBM 701 from December 20, 1952 until February 28, 1955. Unlike later IBM 7 track drives, the 726 could read backwards as well as forwards.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/Cellulose_acetate": "Cellulose acetate is the acetate ester of cellulose. It was first prepared in 1865. Cellulose acetate is used as a film base in photography, as a component in some coatings, and as a frame material for eyeglasses; it is also used as a synthetic fiber in the manufacture of cigarette filters and playing cards. In photographic film, cellulose acetate replaced nitrate film in the 1950s, being far less flammable and cheaper to produce.",
  "/wiki/IBM_7_track": "IBM's first magnetic tape data storage devices, introduced in 1952, use what is now generally known as 7 track tape.  The magnetic tape is 1/2\" wide and there are six data tracks plus one parity track for a total of seven parallel tracks that span the length of the tape.  Data is stored as six-bit characters, with each bit of the character and the additional parity bit stored in a different track.",
  "/wiki/IBM_729": "The IBM 729 Magnetic Tape Unit was IBM's iconic tape mass storage system from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s.  Part of the IBM 7 track family of tape units, it was used on  late 700, most 7000 and many 1400 series computers. Like its predecessor, the IBM 727 and many successors, the 729 used 1/2\u00a0inch (12.7\u00a0mm) magnetic tape up to 2400 feet (730 m) long wound on reels up to 10\u00bd\u00a0inch (267\u00a0mm) diameter. To allow rapid tape acceleration (and thus reduced seek/access times), long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and the read/write heads to absorb sudden increases in tape tension which would otherwise break the tape. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring in the back of the tape reel.",

  "/wiki/IBM_1401": "The IBM 1401 is a variable-wordlength decimal computer that was announced by IBM on October 5, 1959. The first member of the highly successful IBM 1400 series, it was aimed at replacing unit record equipment for processing data stored on punched cards and at providing peripheral services for larger computers. The 1401 is considered to be the Model-T Ford of the computer industry, because it was mass-produced and because of its sales volume. Over 12,000 units were produced and many were leased or resold after they were replaced with newer technology. The 1401 was withdrawn on February 8, 1971.",
  "/wiki/9-track_tape": "The IBM System/360, released in 1964, introduced what is now generally known as 9 track tape.  The \u00bd\u00a0inch (12.7\u00a0mm) wide magnetic tape media and reels are the same size as the earlier IBM 7 track format it replaced, but the new format has eight data tracks and one parity track for a total of nine parallel tracks. Data is stored as 8-bit characters, spanning the full width of the tape (including the parity bit). Various recording methods were employed during its lifetime as tape speed and data density increased, including PE (phase encoding), GCR (group coded recording) and NRZI (non-return-to-zero, inverted, sometimes pronounced \"nur-zee\"). Tapes came in various sizes up to 3,600 feet (1,100\u00a0m) in length.",
  "/wiki/Group_coded_recording": "In computer science, group coded recording or group code recording (GCR) refers to several distinct but related encoding methods for magnetic media. The first, used in 6250\u00a0bpi magnetic tape since 1973, is an error-correcting code combined with a run length limited (RLL) encoding scheme, belonging into the group of modulation codes. The others are different mainframe hard disk as well as floppy disk encoding methods used in some microcomputers until the late 1980s. GCR is a modified form of a NRZI code, but necessarily with a higher transition density.",

  "/wiki/Quarter_Inch_Cartridge": "Quarter inch cartridge tape (abbreviated QIC, commonly pronounced \"quick\") is a magnetic tape data storage format introduced by 3M in 1972, with derivatives still in use as of 2016. QIC comes in a rugged enclosed package of aluminum and plastic that holds two tape reels driven by a single belt in direct contact with the tape. The tape was originally 1\u20444 inch (6.35\u00a0mm) wide and anywhere from 300 to 1,500 feet (91 to 457\u00a0m) long. Data is written linearly along the length of the tape in one track (mostly on pre-1980 equipment), or written \"serpentine\", one track at a time, the drive reversing direction at the end of the tape, and each track's data written in the opposite direction to its neighbor. Since its introduction, it has been widely used, and many variations exist. There is a QIC trade association that publishes QIC standards which include interfaces and logical formats. To a very large extent it was the efficiency and openness of this organization which encouraged hardware and software developers to use this type of drive and media.",
