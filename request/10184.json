It was released in the United States on 5 June 2001 on Virgin Records. Chao and others sing in Arabic, English, French, Galician, Portuguese and Spanish on this album. The backing track to \"Homens\", a tight rap about various kinds of men, written and performed by Brazilian journalist (and Chao's friend) Valeria dos Santos Costa, is identical to the backing track for \"Bongo Bong\", Chao's successful single from four years earlier; however, in the short documentary film Infinita tristeza (included within the bonus section of his 2002 live DVD Babylonia en Guagua), Chao stated that \"Homens\" was the song for which the well-known backing track was originally recorded. The final song on the album, \"Infinita Tristeza\", does not contain any vocals by Chao, but it consists of the same backing track as \"Me Gustas T\u00fa\", over which several samples and soundbites are layered; most of them come from a cartoon-based TV documentary film about pregnancy and childbirth, produced in 1977 by TVE and aimed at children. A number of voice samples from the documentary are looped and repeated throughout the track in Chao's typical fragmented style.",

It is slightly different from his previous works because of a stronger emphasis on a string background.

Musically, the album features more R&B themes featuring a layering of a female voice on a few tracks, and it is especially notable and true to the MC Solaar character which is strong emotion expressed in the delivery and lyrics. The album pays tribute to Senegal, where he spent his childhood. He uses the album to condemn the role of the World Bank in developing nations. This is most apparent on the track \"Les Colonies,\" where the lyrics state, \"Dans cette \u00e8re de n\u00e9goce o\u00f9 ne vivent que les big boss/ Rentabilit\u00e9 - instabilit\u00e9 - imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9/ N'ont fait qu'augmenter les taux de mortalit\u00e9,\" meaning, \"In this era of trade where only the big bosses live/ Profitability - instability - imbecility/ Have done nothing but increase rates of mortality,\" referring to policies of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.",
