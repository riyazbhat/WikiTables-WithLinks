It took place in Frankfurt-am-Main, West Germany and was held at the Gro\u00dfer Sendesaal des hessischen Rundfunks on Sunday 3 March 1957. The show was hosted by German actress Anaid Iplicjian.\nLike the first edition of the contest, this one was still mainly a radio programme, but there was a noticeable increase in the number of people with televisions.\n The winner was the Netherlands with the song \"Net als toen\", performed by Corry Brokken, written by Willy van Hemert and composed by Guus Jansen. This was the Netherlands' first victory in the contest.\n For some time, a rumour had existed that the privilege of hosting the 1957 contest was given to Germany because they had come in second place in 1956 with \"Im Wartesaal zum gro\u00dfen Gl\u00fcck\" by Walter Andreas Schwarz. In fact, not only were the official 1956 scores withheld, but the rule stating that the winning nation hosts the next year's Eurovision Song Contest had not yet been conceived. It was planned at the time that each participating country would take it in turns to host the event. However, as more countries wished to participate, this became impractical.",

At the close of voting, it had received 10 points, placing 3rd in a field of 10.\n The song is a love duet, with the singers parting before one of them takes a sea voyage on the ship of the title. Additionally, the song is famous for the kiss the duo exchanged at the end of the performance - the longest stage kiss in Contest history, made so by a stagehand omitting to signal for it to end.\n While the Contest was still predominantly a radio show at the time, the conservative social mores ensured that this event has entered Eurovision folklore. Indeed, at the late 2005 Congratulations special, hosts Katrina Leskanich and Renars Kaupers pretended to re-enact it, only to have Wilke herself appear between them.\n It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1958 Contest by Raquel Rastenni with \"Jeg rev et blad ud af min dagbog\".",

She manifested her fluency in four languages by switching between a strong transatlantic English, French, German and Luxembourgish in the course of talking, often in the same sentence.\n Sweden's the Herreys were the winners of this contest with the song, \"Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley\". This was the Nordic country's second win, and the first one in Swedish, as ABBA performed Waterloo in English when they won in 1974.

This act, while unable to be repeated at the Contest itself, earned the song the Danish nickname \"The Swimming Pool Song\".\n An English version of \"Det' lige det\", entitled \"Waiting in the Rain\", was released as the B-side of the 45 rpm single.\n It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1985 contest by Hot Eyes again, this time with \"Sku' du sp\u00f8rg' fra no'en?\".",
  "/wiki/Hot_Eyes": "Hot Eyes was the name adopted for international acts by the Danish singing duo known in their home country as Kirsten and S\u00f8ren. It was formed by Kirsten Siggard (born 7 September 1954 in Slagelse) and S\u00f8ren Bundgaard (born 4 March 1956 in Glostrup).\n Kirsten was brought up in a traditional Christian family who sang in a church choir when she was young and later pursued a career deemed appropriate and desirable, working in a bank, where she met her husband, Jorgen. S\u00f8ren was a musician, singer and composer, at that time a member of the Danish band Sir Henry. Both Sir Henry and Kirsten entered the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, which serves as the Danish pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), in 1983. For some reason, Sir Henry's entry, \"Og Livet g\u00e5r\" with music composed by S\u00f8ren and Leif Pedersen was disqualified and Kirsten took their place in the final, but in a somewhat consolation-prize style they sang as backing vocals for Kirsten.\n S\u00f8ren later decided to leave Sir Henry in favor of further cooperation with Kirsten, and the duo entered the Dansk MGP in 1984 as Hot Eyes with the song \"Det' lige det\" with music by S\u00f8ren and lyrics by Keld Heick (who also penned lyrics to all other Hot Eyes' Dansk MGP entries). The song became known in Denmark as the \"swimming pool song\", as at the end of the Dansk MGP performance Kirsten threw S\u00f8ren into a swimming pool by the stage. They won the contest and therefore represented Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest 1984, taking the fourth place, even though they were unable to replicate the swimming pool gimmick. This was Denmark's best placing since 1963, when the country's entry won the contest. Kirsten was actually pregnant with her first son while singing at Eurovision.\n Riding on their popularity, they went on to win the Dansk MGP again in 1985 with \"Sku' du sp\u00f8rg' fra no'en?\" - the only ever second win in a row. It was only then that Kirsten decided to give up her work in the bank and embark on a full-time career in entertainment with Hot Eyes. The song was notable for featuring S\u00f8ren's nine-year-old daughter, Lea Bundgaard, who played a vital role in the performance. This time, however, they took only eleventh place at the ESC.\n In 1986 and 1987 Kirsten & S\u00f8ren entered the Dansk MGP as well, but did not win, coming fourth with \"Sig det, som det er\" and fifth with \"Farvel og Tak\" respectively. In the meantime, Kirsten began her theatrical career, appearing in a theatre play as well as musicals such as Chess or Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n 1988 brought though was lucky for Hot Eyes, when their entry, \"Ka' du se, hva' jeg sa'?\" won the Dansk MGP again, making them record three-time winners of the contest (Tommy Seebach equalled this record in 1993). At the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 (where they were actually billed as Kirsten & S\u00f8ren), they also placed very favorably, coming third, which was Denmark's best placing in twenty five years. Kirsten was pregnant again (with her second son), but this time much more visibly - she gave birth only three weeks after the performance.\n Even though the duo did not split officially until 1991, they did not record together after 1988. In 1989, S\u00f8ren and Keld Heick wrote another song for the Dansk MGP together, but this time for Birthe Kj\u00e6r, winning the contest again. They both appeared on stage as backing singers for Birthe, along with Lei and Lupe Moe, who supported no fewer than ten Danish ESC entries from 1981 to 2002. \"Vi maler byen r\u00f8d\" came third again at the Eurovision. S\u00f8ren also tried his luck as composer in the 1993 and 1999 Dansk MGP, but did not win, and currently runs a recording company called \"SB Studio\" in Aalborg.\n Kirsten entered the Dansk MGP again in 1990 with \"Inden L\u00e6nge\" by another composer and different in style, but failed to secure another ticket to Eurovision. The phone number viewers were using to vote for this song was later revealed to have had technical problems, though it was too late to do anything about it. In 1992, she formed a trio named \"Swing Sisters\" with opera singer Kirsten Vaupel and actor Lise-Lotte Norup, with whom she toured Denmark and several other European countries. She also performed with S\u00f8ren on several special occasions later, reprising some of the Hot Eyes hits.\n Kirsten's solo career has gone from strength to strength.  Famous in Denmark for her award-winning portrayal of \u00c9dith Piaf in 1991.  A new tour has been launched in January 2014 of a musical play called Spurven (the sparrow).

It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1990 Contest by Lonnie Devantier with \"Hallo Hallo\", with lyrics also by Keld Heick.\n The song qualified as the Danish entry into the Eurovision Song Contest by the usual means of winning that year's Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. All of the contributors were Dansk Melodi Grand Prix regulars - although for Birthe it was the first, and only, time to win after three unsuccessful attempts, Keld Heick had by then authored lyrics to five winning songs, and S\u00f8ren Bundgaard wrote music and co-performed three of them, although with another female vocalist, Kirsten Siggaard, as part of the duo Hot Eyes. Heick also authored the lyrics to three 1990s Danish entries, and entered the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix numerous times from 1970s to 1990s as both lyricist, composer and performer (with his wife Hilda), while S\u00f8ren Bundgaard also tried his luck as composer a few other times, including two unsuccessful Hot Eyes entries.\n \"Vi maler byen r\u00f8d\" is an evocation of good times, with Kj\u00e6r describing the fun that can be had by \"painting the town red\". Musically, it is something of a throwback to an earlier time as well, sounding like a more unabashed vocal performance than the more modern numbers starting to achieve success at the Contest at the time. It is also memorable for the fact that Kj\u00e6r was one of the older contestants to have performed in many years. The performance was unique for the fact that not only the song's author's, but also the conductor, Henrik Krogsgaard (also a Eurovision regular), joined Birthe on stage as backup singers and dancers. Krogsgaard was \"invited\" by Birthe to join her by a gesture referring to the song's lyrics, which he promptly did leaving the orchestra to be conducted by the host country's backup conductor, to the surprise of the TV viewers.\n The song has become known as one of the stronger Danish entries, and Birthe Kj\u00e6r herself was originally slated to perform it as part of a medley of favourites at the Congratulations special in late 2005, but had to withdraw due to ill health. Her place was taken by Tomas Thordarsson (from the 2004 Contest) and the song was still greeted enthusiastically.\n In 2009 it was announced that the song would be used as the title for the Danish musical \"Vi maler byen r\u00f8d: The Musical\". The show (written by Rasmus Mansachs) played in Copenhagen, Denmark in April 2010 and was based on and filled with more than 20 of the biggest Danish Eurovision Song from the 1950s up to the present. Birthe Kj\u00e6r herself was in the audience in the premiere weekend. The show gained cult status long before its premiere, becoming the most \"liked\" Danish play on Facebook ever.

Mols is the name of a district in east Mid Jutland, while Skagen is Denmark's northernmost town (in North Jutland), so the two locations are not in fact vastly far apart (about 170 km as the crow flies).\n Musically, the song is a comparatively slow one, in contrast to the increasingly up-tempo style of other contest entries. It was chosen as the winner of a preliminary Danish song contest by a jury of music professionals (instead of the usual way of letting viewers decide by telephone voting). Initially the song did not enjoy much popularity among the general public, but that seemed to change after its relatively high placing in the international contest.\n Despite the successful placement of the song, Denmark did not participate in the 1996 contest, as the qualification rules had been changed to require all competing countries barring the host nation to qualify - something the Danes were unable to accomplish. The performance was, however, enough to qualify Denmark as one of the entrants in the next Contest. Hence, it was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1997 contest by K\u00f8lig Kaj with \"Stemmen i mit liv\".",

The song was written by one of the brothers, J\u00f8rgen Olsen. On the day of their victory, J\u00f8rgen Olsen was 50 years and 61 days of age, making him the oldest artist yet to win the contest. However, he would not hold the record for long, as Dave Benton triumphed in the following year at the age of 50 years and 101 days, breaking the record by 40 days.

All the postcards are filmed in Stockholm, Sweden, however, the only exception is the postcard for Sweden, which is filmed before Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. The logo for the contest, a pair of open mouth lips, was chosen by SVT, and was described by its designers as \"a sensual, yet stylistically pure mouth representing song, dialogue and speech\", and was later one of the possible choices for the generic logo introduced at the 2004 Contest.\n The favourite in this year's contest was Estonia, who was also a fan favourite and praised by the press. However, as the voting results came in, Denmark immediately took control of the scoreboard, beating Russia into second place and Latvia into 3rd place.

The countries with the five lowest average scores over the previous five contests who had participated in 1999, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia were excluded meaning that five countries could return. These countries were: Finland, Macedonia, Romania, Russia and Switzerland.
