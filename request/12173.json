The winner was the Netherlands with the song Net als toen, performed by Corry Brokken, written by Willy van Hemert and composed by Guus Jansen. This was the Netherlands' first victory in the contest.

While the Contest was still predominantly a radio show at the time, the conservative social mores ensured that this event has entered Eurovision folklore. Indeed, at the late 2005 Congratulations special, hosts Katrina Leskanich and Renars Kaupers pretended to re-enact it, only to have Wilke herself appear between them.
