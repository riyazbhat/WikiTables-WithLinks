Empire Stadium also hosted the Grey Cup game in 1958, 1960, 1963, 1966, 1971, and 1974; seven times in total.\n Empire Stadium was often home to the Shrine Bowl Provincial Championship for provincial senior high school.\n The stadium was also home to the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League during the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as the Vancouver Royals of the same league for their only year of play in 1968.\n Just before the 1966 Grey Cup game, the stadium had the new \"gooseneck\" or \"slingshot\" goal posts erected invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman, marking the first time these goalposts were used at any level of football in a championship game. They were first used a week earlier at Montreal's Autostade for the 1966 Eastern Conference final; this model goalpost would soon become the standard design in the NFL and CFL. In 1970, it became the first facility in Canada to have artificial playing surface installed made by 3M, under the brand name \"Tartan Turf\".\n Both the Lions and Whitecaps moved to BC Place Stadium for the 1983 season. The stadium was demolished in the early 1990s. The site served as a parking lot for the neighbouring Pacific National Exhibition as well as Playland for many years before being converted to a soccer field and track on the site of the old field.\n With BC Place Stadium undergoing renovations in 2010 and 2011, the BC Lions and Vancouver Whitecaps played their home games at Empire Field, a temporary field constructed on the former grounds of Empire Stadium.  After the renovations to BC Place were complete, the temporary stadium was removed.  The park and sports fields were restored for community use.",
  "/wiki/Washington_Whips": "The Washington Whips were a soccer team based in Washington, D.C. that played in the United Soccer Association (USA). The league was made up of teams imported from foreign leagues. The Washington Whips were the Aberdeen F.C. from Scotland. The name was chosen as the outcome of a newspaper contest.\n The team's owner was Earl Foreman, later owner of the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association and president of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. Edward T. Reynolds was the booth announcer for the club prior to the merger.\n In 1967, the Whips played for the league championship but came up short. After losing a coin toss, the Whips played the Los Angeles Wolves at the L.A. Coliseum in front of a crowd of 17,824. The two teams played to a 4-4 tie in regulation and then a 5-5 tie after the first overtime. At 1:26 in sudden death overtime, Ally Shewan of the Whips kicked an own goal to give the game to the Wolves. Washington played with only 10 players for 94 minutes as Jim Smith was ejected in the 30th minute. After being tied 1-1 at half time, the teams scored 4 goals in 90 seconds early in the second half and then a pair of goals at the 82nd and 88th minutes tied it up again. After falling behind in overtime, the Whips tied the game with only 10 seconds remaining on a shot by Francis Munro.\n Following the 1967 season, the USA merged with the National Professional Soccer League to form the North American Soccer League with the teams from the former USA having to create their rosters from scratch. Their home field was D.C. Stadium despite complaints after the 1967 season that the $109,000 a year rent was too high.\n In 1968 they fielded the only one-armed player in NASL history, Victorio Casa of Argentina and they missed the playoffs on the final game of the season.\n Following the 1968 season, the team disbanded and in November 1968, all the players became free agents.",
  "/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C.": "Aberdeen Football Club (also known as The Dons) is a Scottish professional football club based in Aberdeen, Scotland. They compete in the Scottish Premiership and have never been relegated from the top division of the Scottish football league system since they were promoted in 1905, despite twice finishing within the relegation zone. Aberdeen have won four Scottish league titles, seven Scottish Cups and six Scottish League Cups. They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, having won the European Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup in 1983.\n Formed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984\u201385, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013\u201314 Scottish League Cup, followed up by multiple second-place finishes behind Celtic in the league during the 2010s.\n Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of 20,866 and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dug-out, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman.\n The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. In modern times, Aberdeen have almost exclusively played with all-red strips with white detailing. Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they have no geographically close rivals. Lacking a local competitor, Aberdeen have instead developed rivalries with more distant opponents such as Dundee United (collectively known as the \"New Firm\" in the 1980s) and Rangers.",
  "/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Memorial_Stadium": "Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (commonly known as RFK Stadium, originally District of Columbia Stadium) is a multi-purpose stadium in Washington, D.C. It is located about two miles (3 km) due east of the U.S. Capitol building, near the west bank of the Anacostia River and adjacent to the D.C. Armory. Opened 59 years ago in 1961, it was owned by the federal government until 1986.\n RFK Stadium has been home to a National Football League (NFL) team, two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, five professional soccer teams, two college football teams, a bowl game, and a USFL team. It has hosted five NFC Championship games, two MLB All-Star Games, men's and women's World Cup matches, nine men's and women's first-round soccer games of the 1996 Olympics, three MLS Cup matches, two MLS All-Star games, and numerous American friendlies and World Cup qualifying matches. It has hosted college football, college soccer, baseball exhibitions, boxing matches, a cycling race, a Le Mans auto race, marathons, and dozens of major concerts and other events.\n RFK was one of the first major stadiums designed to host both baseball and football. Although other stadiums already served this purpose, such as Cleveland Stadium (1931) and Baltimore's Memorial Stadium (1950), RFK was one of the first to employ what became known as the circular \"cookie-cutter\" design.\n It is owned and operated by Events DC (the successor agency to the DC Armory Board), a quasi-public organization affiliated with the city government, under a lease that runs until 2038 from the National Park Service, which owns the land.\n On September 5, 2019, the District announced plans to demolish the stadium due to maintenance costs.",
