The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II.",

The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of King Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king's honour. It was established as a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway. From 1877, the city's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage, a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897. In 1925 the city, after incorporating the village retaining its former name, was renamed Oslo.

Population: 232 052 (2015 est.). Over its history, Kropyvnytskyi has changed its name several times. The settlement was known as Yelisavetgrad (Ukrainian: \u0404\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434 [j\u025bl\u02b2isav\u02b2\u025bt\u0263rad]) after Empress Elizabeth of Russia (r. 1741-1761) from 1752 to 1924, was renamed Zinovyevsk (Ukrainian: \u0417\u0456\u043d\u043e\u0432'\u044d\u0301\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a, [z\u02b2in\u0254v\u025b\u0301vs\u02b2k]) after Bolshevik revolutionary and Politburo member Grigory Zinoviev in 1924, who was born there in 1883. Following the assassination of the First Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Sergei Kirov (in office 1926-1934), the town was renamed Kirovo (Ukrainian: \u041a\u0406\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e [k\u02b2\u00edr\u0254v\u0254]) in Kirov's honour on 7 December 1934, as did numerous other localities throughout the USSR (including present-day Kirov in Kirov Oblast, Kirovakan, Kirovabad, as well as a uncountable number of Kirovsk, Kirovo, Kirovsky and other derivatives). Concurrently to the creation of the Kirovohrad Oblast on 10 January 1939, and to distinguish it from the Kirov Oblast in central Russia, Kirovo was renamed Kirovohrad (Ukrainian: \u041a\u0456\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434 [kirowo\u02c8\u0266r\u0251d]; Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0434, romanized: Kirovograd), a name it maintained until 2016. Due to decommunization the name of the city was changed to Kropyvnytskyi, after writer, actor and playwright Marko Kropyvnytskyi, who was born near the city. However the Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because as it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine, and the Oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment.. The city is the birthplace of noted figures such as Grigory Zinoviev, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Arseny Tarkovsky, African Spir, Marko Kropyvnytskyi and others."
