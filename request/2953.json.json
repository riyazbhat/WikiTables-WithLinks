  "/wiki/Zumwalt-class_destroyer": "The Zumwalt-class destroyer is a class of three United States Navy guided missile destroyers designed as multi-mission stealth ships with a focus on land attack. It is a multi-role class that was designed for secondary roles of surface warfare and anti-aircraft warfare and originally designed with a primary role of naval gunfire support. It was intended to take the place of battleships in meeting a congressional mandate for naval fire support. The ship is designed around its two Advanced Gun Systems, their turrets and magazines, and unique Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) ammunition. LRLAP procurement was cancelled, rendering the guns unusable, so the Navy re-purposed the ships for surface warfare. Procurement was halted after the first three Zumwalts, and the navy reverted to building Arleigh Burke destroyers. A National Review article by Mike Fredenburg calls the Zumwalts \"an unmitigated disaster\".  The class design emerged from the DD-21 \"land attack destroyer\" program as \"DD(X)\".",
