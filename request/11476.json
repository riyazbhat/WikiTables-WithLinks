Located on a hill above the Potomac River, the school's main campus is identifiable by its flagship Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark. Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805. However, the university has always been governed independently of the church, and the majority of Georgetown students are not Catholic. Georgetown is a highly selective school, accepting 14 percent of undergraduate applicants for its class of 2023. The university offers degree programs in forty-eight disciplines, enrolling an average of 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 post-graduate students from more than 135 countries. Georgetown's notable alumni include U.S. Presidents, billionaires, U.S. Supreme Court Justices, as well as international royalty and heads of state. The school produces more U.S. diplomats than any other university. Georgetown is also a top feeder school for careers in finance and investment banking on Wall Street. Georgetown is home to the country's largest student-run business, largest student-run financial institution, the oldest continuously running student theatre troupe, and one of the oldest debating societies in the United States.",
