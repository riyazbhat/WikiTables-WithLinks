  "/wiki/Kirkcaldy": "Kirkcaldy (/k\u0259r\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0di/ (listen); Scottish Gaelic: Cair Chaladain) is a town and former royal burgh in Fife, on the east coast of Scotland. It is about 11.6 miles (19\u00a0km) north of Edinburgh and 27.6 miles (44\u00a0km) south-southwest of Dundee. The town had a recorded population of 49,460 in 2011, making it Fife's second-largest settlement and the 12th most populous settlement in Scotland.\n Kirkcaldy has long been nicknamed the Lang Toun (listen\u00a0(help\u00b7info); Scots for \"long town\") in reference to the early town's 0.9-mile (1.4\u00a0km) main street, as indicated on maps from the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries. The street would finally reach a length of nearly 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km), connecting the burgh to the neighbouring settlements of Linktown, Pathhead, Sinclairtown and Gallatown, which became part of the town in 1876. The formerly separate burgh of Dysart was also later absorbed into Kirkcaldy in 1930 under an act of Parliament.\n The area around Kirkcaldy has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. The first document to refer to the town is from 1075, when Malcolm III granted the settlement to the church of Dunfermline. David I later gave the burgh to Dunfermline Abbey, which had succeeded the church: a status which was officially recognised by Robert I in 1327. The town only gained its independence from Abbey rule when it was created a royal burgh by Charles I in 1644.\n From the early 16th century, the establishment of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries.The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.\n Today, the town is a major service centre for the central Fife area. Public facilities include a main leisure centre, theatre, museum and art gallery, three public parks and an ice rink. Kirkcaldy is also known as the birthplace of social philosopher and economist Adam Smith who wrote his magnum opus The Wealth of Nations in the town. In the early 21st century, employment is dominated by the service sector: the biggest employer in the town is PayWizard, formerly known as MGT plc (call centre). Other main employers include NHS Fife, Forbo (vinyl floor coverings), Fife College, Whitworths (flour millers) and Smith Anderson (paper making).",

  "/wiki/Newburgh,_Fife": "Newburgh is a royal burgh and parish  of Fife, Scotland , having a population of 2,171 (est 2011). Newburgh's population has grown about 10% since 1901 when the population was counted at 1904 persons. \nIn 1266 Newburgh was granted burgh status by King Alexander III of Scotland, as a burgh belonging to the Abbot of Lindores. In 1600, Newburgh was given to Patrick Leslie, son of the Earl of Rothes \u2013 a powerful Scottish family - and in 1631, Newburgh was made a Royal Burgh by King Charles I.\n Newburgh is situated on the Firth of Tay, seven miles (11\u00a0km) northwest of Ladybank Junction alongside the Edinburgh to Inverness railway line (between Perth and Ladybank). Newburgh railway station closed in 1955 (pre-Beeching). An active campaign to reopen the station is ongoing and locals are hopeful of success. \n Fife Scottish (now Stagecoach in Fife) used to have a bus depot at East Shore Road but the depot closed in 1991. No buses are now based in Newburgh although the Perth to Glenrothes and Newburgh to St Andrews via Ladybank station still serve the town.\n Since WW2 many new houses have been built in Newburgh but the population has only increased by about 10%. Probably because average house occupancy rates are much lower since the baby boomer years. \n For some time, Newburgh's industries chiefly consisted of the making of linen, linoleum floorcloth, oilskin fabric and quarrying. There was for many years a net and coble fishery on the Firth Of Tay, mainly for salmon and sea trout. \n The harbour area was used originally for boatbuilding and the transshipment of cargoes to Perth for vessels of over 200 tons. \nRaw materials for making linoleum such as cork and linseed oil were also imported  at the \"Factory Pier\". Aggregates from the Whin Stone quarry were also shipped from Bell's Pier.  \n The main employer from the early 1920s was the linoleum factory known locally as the \"Tayside\" from  The Tayside Floorcloth Company. For many years Newburgh was a prosperous industrial town pulling in workers for the factories from surrounding  towns and villages. As linoleum fell out of fashion in the late 60s and 70s attempts were made to produce Vinyl flooring and tiles but the factory was no longer  profitable and after changing hands a couple of times it finally closed in 1980 after a large fire destroyed much of the building. \n Situated to the East of the linoleum factory was another factory known locally as \"The Oilskin\", many women worked there from before The Great War producing oilskin fabric for waterproof clothing such  as fishermen's suits and Sou'westers. The factory was taken over by textiles giant Courtaulds in the 1960s but sadly also closed some years later as demand for the product declined.\n All of these old industries in Newburgh have gone except quarrying which is now the town's biggest single employer. Newburgh is now mainly a dormitory town with many of those of working age travelling outwith the town for work. Perth, Dundee and Glenrothes are in easy reach by car. Local trades and services including a Health Centre and a Nursing Home and a few shops  including a brand new Co-op on the site of the former Ship Inn still provide some local employment.\n In 2017 a new whisky distillery opened on the site of Lindores Abbey at the east end of Newburgh. This will produce Lindores Abbey whisky on the site where the earliest reference to \"Aqua Vita\" a form of whisky was produced by the monks.[citation needed] The distillery incorporates a high quality event venue and offers catering and tours of the distillery and Abbey ruins. \n After many years of lying derelict, the linoleum factory was completely demolished and cleared and its site is now a recreational waterfront linked to the Mugdrum Park and the Fife Coastal Path.\n Newburgh was the birthplace in 1823 of Robert Hunter lexicographer and encyclopaedist.\n The civil parish has a population of 2,171 (in 2011).",
