His most successful event was the 800 metres, where he placed seventh in the final. In June he had set a personal best time over 800 metres of 1:44.34 minutes in Conegliano, Italy; at the time, that was a world youth best, equivalent with the World Record for under age 18.\n In July 2006 Ali was arrested in Kenya, suspected for age cheating at the 2005 World Youth Championships. The IAAF Council, gathered in Beijing while the 2006 World Junior Championships took place, reported the slow progression of the case. A few days before, Ali had actually won a World Junior bronze medal over 1500 metres and finished seventh over 800 metres on the track.
