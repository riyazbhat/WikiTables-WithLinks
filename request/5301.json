  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha (sometimes called cha-cha), is a dance of Cuban origin. It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance. In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated.",

  "/wiki/Viennese_Waltz": "Viennese waltz (German: Wiener Walzer) is a genre of ballroom dance. At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the waltz, including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz. What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or \"waltz\" position. The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar  (the international standard of 30 measures per minute), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words Walzer (German), vals (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and valse (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz. The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation.",
