  "/wiki/Brookite": "Brookite is the orthorhombic variant of titanium dioxide, TiO2, which occurs in many natural polymorphic forms (minerals with the same composition but different structure). The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) recognizes four forms; the others are akaogiite (monoclinic), anatase (tetragonal) and rutile (tetragonal).  Brookite is rare compared to anatase and rutile and, like these forms, it exhibits photocatalytic activity.  Brookite has a larger cell volume than either anatase or rutile, with 8 TiO2 groups per unit cell, compared with 4 for anatase and 2 for rutile. Iron Fe, tantalum Ta and niobium Nb are common impurities.",
  "/wiki/Anatase": "Anatase is a metastable mineral form of titanium dioxide (TiO2).  The mineral in natural forms is mostly encountered as a black solid, although the pure material is colorless or white.  Two other naturally occurring mineral forms of TiO2 are known, brookite and rutile.",

  "/wiki/Malachite": "Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral, with the formula Cu2CO3 (OH)2. This opaque, green-banded mineral crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, and most often forms botryoidal, fibrous, or stalagmitic masses, in fractures and deep, underground spaces, where the water table and hydrothermal fluids provide the means for chemical precipitation. Individual crystals are rare, but occur as slender to acicular prisms. Pseudomorphs after more tabular or blocky azurite crystals also occur.",
  "/wiki/Azurite": "Azurite is a soft, deep-blue copper mineral produced by weathering of copper ore deposits. During the early 19th century, it was also known as chessylite, after the type locality at Chessy-les-Mines near Lyon, France. The mineral, a carbonate with the chemical formula Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, has been known since ancient times, and was mentioned in Pliny the Elder's Natural History under the Greek name kuanos (\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2: \"deep blue,\" root of English cyan) and the Latin name caeruleum. Since antiquity, azurite's exceptionally deep and clear blue has been associated with low-humidity desert and winter skies. The modern English name of the mineral reflects this association, since both azurite and azure are derived via Arabic from the Persian lazhward (\u0644\u0627\u0698\u0648\u0631\u062f), an area known for its deposits of another deep-blue stone, lapis lazuli (\"stone of azure\").",
