  "/wiki/NY_30": "New York State Route 30 (NY 30) is a state highway in the central part of New York in the United States. It extends for 300.71 miles (483.95 km) from an interchange with NY 17 (Future Interstate 86) in the Southern Tier to the US\u2013Canada border in the state's North Country, where it continues into Quebec as Route 138. On a regional level, the route serves to connect the Catskill Park to the Adirondack Park. In the latter, NY 30 is known as the Adirondack Trail. Aside from the state parks, the route serves the city of Amsterdam (where it meets the New York State Thruway) and several villages.\n NY 30 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of its modern routing south of Wells, replacing a series of designations that had been assigned to the highway in the 1920s. The portion of what is now NY 30 north of Speculator was initially part of NY 10. When that route was truncated to Arietta c.\u20091960, NY 30 was extended northward over NY 10's former alignment by way of an overlap with NY 8.",

NY 10 formally began concurrent with NY 8, until NY 8 was truncated to end at the northern end of the overlap by 2017. While NY 8 follows a more westerly alignment between Deposit and Higgins Bay via Utica, NY 10 veers to the east, serving Delhi, Cobleskill, and Canajoharie. Along the way, the road intersects Interstate 88 (I-88) near Cobleskill and U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Sharon Springs. NY 10 was assigned in 1924; however, it initially followed a completely different alignment than it does today. At the time, it began at the New Jersey state line in Rockland County and followed modern US 9W north to Albany. From here, it continued to Saranac Lake via Schenectady, Saratoga Springs, Lake George, Chestertown, North Creek, Long Lake, and Tupper Lake.",

From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY 28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.
