  "/wiki/La_Passion": "\"La Passion\" is a song co-written and recorded by Italian DJ Gigi D'Agostino. It was released in October 2000 as the sixth single from his 1999 album L'Amour Toujours. It is a Remix with some additional melodic variations of the song \"Rectangle\" by the French musician Jacno, which doesn't originally contain any vocals. Armenian singer and house music producer Andrew Sarkeesian provides the vocals, which were heavily auto-tuned, as were many songs which followed Cher's trend during the early 2000s. D'Agostino has made various mixes for different albums. The song was a hit in Austria and Belgium, where it became a number-one single. It is notable that the words added to the French instrumental are a random blend of clich\u00e9 like romantic lyrics with some gaga English as in the opening verse: \"I never think you wanna, we won't belong, I can see your face too strong\" followed by \"I sing you wanna think you'll be wide on mind. Don't you ever satisfy my soul in any by my side\". However, this perhaps has contributed to the song's success making it catchy, witty and easily sung and remembered even by non-singers and non-English speakers.",
