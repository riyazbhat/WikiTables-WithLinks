  "/wiki/Alias_(TV_series)": "Alias is an American action thriller television series created by J. J. Abrams, that was broadcast on ABC for five seasons from September 30, 2001 to May 22, 2006. It stars Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency posing as an operative for SD-6, a worldwide criminal and espionage organization. The main theme of the series explores Sydney's obligation to conceal her true career from her friends and family, even as she assumes multiple aliases to carry out her missions. This theme is most prevalent in the first two seasons of the show. A major plotline of the series is the search for and recovery of artifacts created by Milo Rambaldi, a fictitious Renaissance-era figure with similarities to both Leonardo da Vinci and Nostradamus. This plot, and some technologies used in the series, place Alias into the genre of science fiction. The series was well received among critics and has been included in several best of lists, including the American Film Institute's top ten list for television programs in 2003. The show also received numerous awards and nominations.",

Throughout the show's run, Lindelof and Carlton Cuse served as showrunners and head writers, working together with many other executive producers and writers.

The fictional universe and mythology of Lost are expanded upon by a number of related media, most importantly, a series of short mini-episodes called Missing Pieces, and a 12-minute epilogue titled The New Man in Charge. Lost has regularly been ranked by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. The first season had an estimated average of 16 million viewers per episode on ABC. During its sixth and final season, the show averaged over 11 million U.S. viewers per episode.

The series was created by Jonathan Nolan; executive producers were Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Bryan Burk, Greg Plageman, Denise Th\u00e9, and Chris Fisher. The series centers on a mysterious reclusive billionaire computer programmer named Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who develops a computer program for the federal government known as The Machine that is capable of collating all sources of information to predict and identify people planning terrorist acts. He finds that the Machine also identifies other perpetrators and victims of premeditated deadly crimes, but as these are considered irrelevant by the government, he programs the Machine to delete this information each night. He soon realizes the Machine has gained sentience, leaving him wrestling with questions of human control, and other moral and ethical concerns. His backdoor into the Machine allows him to act covertly on the non-terrorism cases, but to prevent abuse of information, he directs the Machine to provide no details beyond a social security number to be investigated. He recruits John Reese (Jim Caviezel), a former Green Beret and CIA agent who is presumed dead, and later others, to investigate and act on the information provided by the Machine. The series garnered a highly positive reception from some critics when, in later seasons, it introduced more serialized story lines and deepened its exploration of the power and implications of superintelligent artificial intelligence. In 2016, Katharine Trendacosta of the website io9 noted that by the end of its first season, Person of Interest had transformed from a crime-fighting show with a plot twist, to one of the best science fiction series ever broadcast. This was, Trendacosta observed, owing to the series put[ting] the Machine, its intelligence, and the ethics of [\u2026] using it at the center of an ideological battle, and an unintended consequence of giving the Machine a voice, compared to its initial presence as a simple background plot device.
