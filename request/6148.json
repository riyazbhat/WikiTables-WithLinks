  "/wiki/Old_Mission,_Michigan": "Old Mission is an unincorporated community within Peninsula Township, Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan.\n In the 1836 Treaty of Washington, the U.S. federal government agreed to provide local native tribes with both a mission and schools for their reservation. Henry Schoolcraft, the Indian agent representing the government, selected a natural harbor on the eastern shore of the peninsula in Grand Traverse Bay for the planned facilities. In 1838 the Presbyterian Board of Missions, sent the Reverend Peter Dougherty (1805\u20131894) to establish the mission, now known as Old Mission, for which the peninsula would eventually become known.\n The peninsula has extensive cherry orchards and vineyards. There are seven vineyards, but only five have tasting rooms. Because of the remoteness of the peninsula, wine tours take some planning. It is an American Viticultural Area and a center of the Michigan wine industry.

  "/wiki/Mission_Point_Lighthouse": "Mission Point Light is a lighthouse located in the U.S. state of Michigan at the end of Old Mission Point, a peninsula jutting into Grand Traverse Bay 17 miles (27\u00a0km) north of Traverse City. When it was built in 1870, it was an exact copy of the Mama Juda Light (now destroyed), which was built on the Detroit River in 1866.\n The foundation is natural and emplaced. The wooden structure is painted white with black trim. The square tower is attached to a dwelling.\n A fixed white Fifth Order Fresnel lens was installed. The building was only one and one half stories tall. However, its placement on a sand bank 14 feet above the lake's surface created a lens focal plane of 47 feet (14\u00a0m). It was visible from 13 miles (21\u00a0km)[citation needed] at sea. Maintaining the dune and protecting it and the lighthouse from the deleterious effects of wave action has been a constant struggle.\n For 67 years the light served to warn mariners about the shoals off the point. However, new techniques in offshore construction and the automation of lighthouse illumination made it possible to build a navigation aid on the shoal itself. In 1938, work began on a pier for the new light in 19 feet (5.8\u00a0m) of water, about 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) northwest of Mission Point. The light ran on batteries. It was on a 36-foot (11\u00a0m) tall tower, and its focal plane of 52 feet (16\u00a0m) help make it visible for 13 miles (21\u00a0km). It had a 30-second dwell time between flashes, in order to conserve power.\n Famously, the lighthouse stands a few hundred yards south of the 45th parallel north, halfway between the North Pole and the Equator. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1933 and purchased by the State of Michigan. There are a pair of signs that denote its location on the parallel, and it is one of 29 places (six are in Michigan) in the U.S.A. where such signs are known to exist.",
