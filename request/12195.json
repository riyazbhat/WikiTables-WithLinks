The AJ-1 first became operational in 1950 and several were based in South Korea during 1953 as a deterrent against the Communists. Of the 140 built, plus three prototypes, 30 were reconnaissance aircraft. Inflight-refueling equipment was deployed on the Savage in the mid-1950s.

These disestablished and/or deactivated squadrons are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"decommissioned\" squadrons, but proper usage prior to 1998, was that squadrons were \"established\" and \"disestablished\" and after 1998, squadrons are \"established\", \"deactivated\" and sometimes \"reactivated\". It has never been correct to refer to U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons as being \"commissioned\" and \"decommissioned\", ships are commissioned and decommissioned, U.S. Navy aircraft squadrons are not."
