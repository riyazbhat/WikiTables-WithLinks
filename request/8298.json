  "/wiki/Caveat_Emptor": "Caveat emptor (/\u02c8\u025bmpt\u0254\u02d0r/; from caveat, \"may he beware\", a subjunctive form of cav\u0113re, \"to beware\" + \u0113mptor, \"buyer\") is Latin for \"Let the buyer beware\". It has become a proverb in English. Generally, caveat emptor is the contract law principle that controls the sale of real property after the date of closing, but may also apply to sales of other goods.  The phrase caveat emptor and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arise from the fact that buyers typically have less information than the seller about the good or service they are purchasing.  This quality of the situation is known as 'information asymmetry'. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller.",
