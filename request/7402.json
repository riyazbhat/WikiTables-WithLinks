In 2002, he had his best year, winning a gold medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics and taking a World Cup win in Kranjska Gora.\nA song was called after him (Slalom dans la t\u00eate) and in the French ski resort Les Sybelles, a lift was named after his gold medal as well (M\u00e9daille d'Or in La Toussuire).\nAfter this fantastic year, it took Vidal until 2006 to return to the highest level of skiing competition. In January 2006, he won a World Cup race in Kitzb\u00fchel. Barely a month later, on February 24, 2006, he broke his forearm during a training session in Turin.
