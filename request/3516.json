  "/wiki/Austin_Cuvillier": "Austin Cuvillier (August 20, 1779 \u2013 July 11, 1849) was a businessman and political figure in Lower Canada and Canada East.\n He was born Augustin Cuvillier in Quebec City in 1779 and was hired by a Montreal auctioneer, eventually taking over the business when his employer retired. After he formed a partnership with two other men, the business went bankrupt. By this time, Cuvillier had adopted the anglicized first name Austin. By 1807, he was back in the auction business.\n During the War of 1812, he served with the militia. In 1814, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada representing Huntingdon County, as a member of the Parti canadien. He played an important role in the founding of the Bank of Montreal and was one of its first directors. He also helped found the Montreal Fire Insurance Company and became president in 1820. In 1821, he was part of a commission negotiating the sharing of customs duties between Lower and Upper Canada. He opposed the union of the two Canadas. In 1828, he helped present petitions against Governor Dalhousie's policies in London. In 1829, he began to distance himself from the Parti patriote. He opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions that were presented in 1834. By 1836, he was one of the most important auctioneers in Montreal and served as president on the city's Committee of Trade, later the Montreal Board of Trade. He commanded a battalion in the militia during the Lower Canada Rebellion.\n In 1841, he was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada representing Huntingdon and was elected speaker. In 1844, he defended Governor Charles Theophilus Metcalfe against the Reformers when the governor wished to retain exclusive control over patronage. This led to the end of his political career and Cuvillier returned to his auction business.\n He had at least one daughter called Luce (1817\u20131900) and two sons called Maurice and Austin.\n He died of typhus at Montreal in 1849.",

Lord Durham's Report investigating the causes of the Upper and Lower Canada Rebellions recommended merging those two colonies.  The new colony, known as the Province of Canada was created by the Act of Union 1840 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, having effect in 1841. For administrative purposes, the new Province was subdivided into Canada West and Canada East.  The former name of \"Lower Canada\" came back into official use in 1849, and as of the Canadian Confederation of 1867, it formed the newly created province of Quebec.\n An estimated 890,000 people lived in Canada East in 1851.",

  "/wiki/Reform_movement_(pre-Confederation_Canada)": "The Reform movement, sometimes referred to as the Reform Party, began in the 1830s as the movement in the English speaking parts of British North America (Canada). It agitated initially for republicanism, and later for responsible government. The movement dissolved after responsible government was granted to the Province of Canada in 1848, with members forming the Parti bleu and Parti rouge in Canada East and the Liberal Party in Canada West, among other smaller parties.",
  "/wiki/Canada_West": "The Province of Canada (or the United Province of Canada or the United Canadas) was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867. Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838.\n The Act of Union 1840, passed on 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841, merged the Colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a single one with two houses, a Legislative Council as the upper chamber and the Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber. In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838, unification of the two Canadas was driven by two factors. Firstly, Upper Canada was near bankruptcy because it lacked stable tax revenues, and needed the resources of the more populous Lower Canada to fund its internal transportation improvements. Secondly, unification was an attempt to swamp the French vote by giving each of the former provinces the same number of parliamentary seats, despite the larger population of Lower Canada.\n Although Durham's report had called for the Union of the Canadas and for responsible government (a government accountable to an independent local legislature), only the first of the two recommendations was implemented in 1841. For the first seven years, the government was led by an appointed governor general accountable only to the British Crown and the Queen's Ministers. Responsible government was not to be achieved until the second LaFontaine\u2013Baldwin ministry in 1849, when Governor General James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin agreed to request a cabinet be formed on the basis of party, effectively making the elected premier the head of the government and reducing the Governor General to a more symbolic role.\n The Province of Canada ceased to exist at Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867, when it was divided into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Ontario included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Upper Canada, while Quebec included the area occupied by the pre-1841 British colony of Lower Canada (which had included Labrador until 1809, when Labrador was transferred to the British colony of Newfoundland). Upper Canada was primarily English-speaking, whereas Lower Canada was primarily French-speaking.",
  "/wiki/Augustin-Norbert_Morin": "Augustin-Norbert Morin (October 13, 1803 \u2013 July 27, 1865) was a Canadian lawyer and judge.\n Born in Saint-Michel-de-Bellechasse, Lower Canada, into a large Roman Catholic farming family, Morin was identified by the parish priest at a young age as a boy of exceptional talent and intelligence. The parish priest therefore arranged for his education at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, beginning in 1815.  After leaving the seminary, Morin worked as newspaperman in order to earn money for the study of law as clerk in the office of Denis-Benjamin Viger. By 1828 he was practicing law independently, and by 1830 had become involved with colonial politics. Morin helped draft the Ninety-Two Resolutions. Although he took part in the Lower Canada Rebellion and was later arrested, it was not felt that a charge of high treason was justified.\n Following the union of Lower Canada and Upper Canada into the new Province of Canada in 1841, Morin was elected to the first Parliament of the new Province, for the Nicolet electoral district.  He resigned his seat a year later on appointment to the district court for Rimouski, but served on the bench for less than a year.  He resigned from the court and was re-elected to Parliament, this time for the riding of Saguenay, in November, 1842.\n Morin served as Joint Premier of the Province of Canada from Canada East along with his counterparts from Canada West Francis Hincks (from October 28, 1851 to September 11, 1854), and with Allan Napier MacNab (from that date until January 27, 1855).\n He resigned from government due to ill health. However, Morin was named a judge in the Quebec Superior Court and he also took part in the commission which drafted a new civil code for Canada East.\n Morin-Heights, Quebec and Val-Morin, Quebec, which Morin help found, are named for him. He also helped found Sainte-Ad\u00e8le, Quebec, which was named after his wife Ad\u00e8le Raymond, the sister of Joseph-Sabin Raymond.\n He died at Sainte-Ad\u00e8le in 1865.",

  "/wiki/Liberal-Conservative": "The Liberal-Conservative Party (French: le Parti lib\u00e9ral-conservateur) was the formal name of the Conservative Party of Canada until 1873, and again from 1922 to 1938, although some Conservative candidates continued to run under the label as late as the 1911 election and others ran as simple Conservatives before 1873. In many of Canada's early elections, there were both \"Liberal-Conservative\" and \"Conservative\" candidates; however, these were simply different labels used by candidates of the same party. Both were part of Sir John A. Macdonald's government and official Conservative and Liberal-Conservative candidates would not, generally,[clarification needed] run against each other. It was also common for a candidate to run on one label in one election and the other in a subsequent election.\n The roots of the name are in the coalition of 1853 in which moderate Reformers and Conservatives from Canada West joined with bleus from Canada East under the dual premiership of Sir Allan MacNab and A.-N. Morin.  The new ministry committed to secularizing Clergy reserves in Canada West and abolishing seigneurial tenure in Canada East.  Over time, the Liberal-Conservatives evolved into the Conservative party and their opponents, the Clear Grits and the Parti rouge evolved into the Liberal Party of Canada.  On October 12, 1916, the last Liberal-Conservative cabinet minister, Sam Hughes, was dismissed, making the executive all officially Conservative Party members.\n Prominent Liberal-Conservative Members of Parliament and Senators in Canadian history include:",

  "/wiki/Tory": "A Tory (/\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0ri/) is a person who holds a political philosophy known as Toryism, based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism, which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved in the English culture throughout history. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase \"God, Queen, and Country\". Tories generally advocate monarchism, and were historically of a high church Anglican religious heritage, opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction.\n The philosophy originates from the Cavalier faction, a royalist group during the English Civil War. The Tories political faction that emerged in 1681 was a reaction to the Whig-controlled Parliaments that succeeded the Cavalier Parliament. It also has exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America, who opposed American secession during the American War of Independence. The loyalists that fled to the Canadas at the end of the American Revolution, the United Empire Loyalists, formed the support base for political cliques in Upper and Lower Canada. Toryism remains prominent in Canada and the United Kingdom. The British Conservative Party and Conservative Party of Canada, and their members, continue to be referred to as Tories.\n The term Tory is used regardless of whether they are traditionalists. Adherents to traditional Toryism in contemporary times are referred to as High Tories. The terms Blue Tory and Red Tory have been used to describe the two different factions of the federal and provincial Conservative/Progressive Conservative parties in Canada. In addition, Pink Tory is used in Canadian politics as a pejorative term to describe a member of the Conservative/Progressive Conservative party who is perceived as liberal.",
