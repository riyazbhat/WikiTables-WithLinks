Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady), the club has won 35 official league titles, 13 Coppa Italia titles and eight Supercoppa Italiana titles, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a joint national record of three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) ranking[a] whilst on the international stage occupies the 5th position in Europe and the eleventh in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, having led the UEFA ranking during seven seasons since its inception in 1979, the most for an Italian team and joint second overall. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league (reformulated as Serie A from 1929) since its debut in 1900 after changing its name to Foot-Ball Club Juventus, with the exception of the 2006-07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. [b] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus the first professional sporting club ante litteram in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa italiana since 2001. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976-77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983-84 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984-85 European Champions' Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both. The club's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (anti-parochialism) and italianit\u00e0 (Italianness). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982-1985, an overall record), among these the first player representing Serie A, Omar S\u00edvori, as well as Michel Platini and three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes.",

  "/wiki/U.S._Citt\u00e0_di_Palermo": "Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica Palermo, known as Palermo Calcio or more simply Palermo, is an Italian football club based in the Sicilian city of Palermo. Originally founded on 1 November 1900, Unione Sportiva Citt\u00e0 di Palermo was excluded from Serie B on 12 July 2019. A phoenix club was formed later the same month, and was admitted into in Serie D for the 2019-20 season. Palermo were the first football club founded in Sicily, the first in the South of Italy and also the 7th oldest extant club in the country. The team achieved its greatest sporting success in the 2000s, during which it had three 5th-placed finishes in the Serie A (including two in a row) and also reached the 2005-06 UEFA Cup's round of 16. The club counts the Coppa Italia Serie C in 1992-1993 as a major honour in their history. With their appearances in 3 Coppa Italia finals - twice in the 1970s (1974 and 1979) and again in 2011) - and their 5 Serie B titles, alongside the many trophies won in the first twenty years of the twentieth century, Palermo is often considered to be one of the most important and successful clubs of Southern Italy. Regarding their performances in European competition, the club has five appearances in UEFA Cup/Europa League; in 2007 it occupied 51st place in UEFA ranking. According to the monthly ranking by the IFFHS the highest ranking ever reached was the 19th place, in both February and June 2006; according to another ranking of the same entity, the rosanero were the 121th best team in the world from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 2009. Since 2008, Palermo has had the right to be an ordinary member of the European Club Association, an international organisation that has taken the place of the abolished G-14 and is composed of the major football clubs of Europe with the purpose of ensuring a common protection of sports, legal and television rights in front of the FIFA.",
  "/wiki/PAOK_F.C.": "PAOK Football Club (Greek: \u03a0\u0391\u0395 \u03a0\u0391\u039f\u039a, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u038c\u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd, Panthessalon\u00edkios Athlitik\u00f3s \u00d3milos Konstantinopolit\u00f3n, Pan-Thessalonian Athletic Club of Constantinopolitans), commonly known as PAOK FC, PAOK Thessaloniki or simply PAOK, is a Greek professional football club based in Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece, and current Super League champions. PAOK are one of the top domestic clubs, the most widely supported in Northern Greece and with the 3rd largest fanbase in the country, according to the latest polls and researches. A research by Marca in August 2018, reported that PAOK are the most popular Greek football team on social media. Established on 20 April 1926 by Greek refugees who fled to Thessaloniki from Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), they play their home games at Toumba Stadium, a 29,000 seating capacity football ground. Their name, along with the club's emblem, the Byzantine-style double-headed eagle with retracted wings, honours the memory of the people and places (mostly from the city of Constantinople) that once belonged to the Byzantine Empire. PAOK currently plays in the top-flight Super League, which they have won three times (in 1976, 1985 and 2019). They are seven-time winners of the Greek Cup (in 1972, 1974, 2001, 2003, 2017, 2018 and 2019). The club has never been relegated to a lower national division, a feat equalled only by rivals Olympiacos and Panathinaikos. PAOK are the only team in Greece that won the Double (in 2019), going unbeaten (26-4-0 record) in a national round-robin league tournament (league format since 1959). Panathinaikos have also won a Championship undefeated (in 1964 with a 24-6-0 record), however without winning the Cup that season. The team has appeared several times in the UEFA Europa League, but has yet to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. Their best European performance was in the 1973-74 season, when they reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup."
