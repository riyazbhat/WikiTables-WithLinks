The city was incorporated in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after World War II, with the construction of Boeing's aircraft assembly plant at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the U.S. Navy, which has operated Naval Station Everett since 1992. Everett received an All-America City Award in 2002.\n Everett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a bedroom community for Seattle in recent decades.
