In the early days of the U.S. Highway System, US\u00a060 was originally to be numbered as US\u00a062. Following extensive lobbying and complaints filed by Kentucky governor William J.

In Kentucky, US\u00a060 parallels the Ohio River (the northern boundary of the state). US\u00a060 enters Kentucky from Cairo, Illinois, traveling northeast to Louisville, then takes a direct eastward route (near Interstate 64, I-64) to rejoin the Ohio River in downtown Ashland, Kentucky.
