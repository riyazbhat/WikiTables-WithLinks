He represented Hochelaga in the House of Commons of Canada from 1892 to 1896 as a Conservative member.\n He was born Pierre-Alphonse-S\u00e9verin in Saint-R\u00e9mi, Canada East, the son of L\u00e9on Lachapelle and R\u00e9becca Lanct\u00f4t, and was educated at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al. Lachapelle served as a papal zouave from 1868 to 1870. He then studied at the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery and set up practice in Saint-Constant, later moving to Saint-Henri. Lachapelle married Elise Demers in 1874. He was mayor for Saint-Henri from 1886 to 1887.\n He contributed to the monthly L\u2019Union m\u00e9dicale du Canada, also serving on its editorial board, and wrote a science column for the Revue canadienne; he also was the first editor for the Journal d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne populaire and the magazine La M\u00e8re et l\u2019enfant. He became one of the first professors at the Montreal campus of the Universit\u00e9 Laval and served on the medical board for the Notre-Dame Hospital. In 1888, he published Manuel d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne \u00e0 l\u2019usage des \u00e9coles et des familles ..., an instructive guide on hygiene which was also translated into English in 1891. In 1889, he was named superintendent for the Cr\u00e8che de la Mis\u00e9ricorde, a child care facility.  He contributed to Le m\u00e9decin de la famille, encyclop\u00e9die de m\u00e9decine et d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne publique et priv\u00e9e contenant la description de toutes les maladies connues ..., published in 1893. In 1907, he helped found the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Justine. He helped establish the Gouttes de Lait program at Montreal with the aim of reducing infant mortality.\n Lachapelle was first elected to the House of Commons in an 1892 by-election held after Alphonse Desjardins was named to the Canadian senate. He was defeated by Joseph Alexandre Camille Madore when he ran for reelection in 1896 and 1900. He died in Montreal at the age of 62 and was buried in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery.\n In 1880, Lachapelle said \"There is one particularly unsettling belief that is particularly widespread and deeply rooted in our families because it is shared by medical practitioners, and that is that there is no point in treating children's diseases.\" He was part of a movement which addressed that misperception.",
  "/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_(historical)": "The Conservative Party of Canada has gone by a variety of names over the years since Canadian Confederation. Initially known as the \"Liberal-Conservative Party\", it dropped \"Liberal\" from its name in 1873, although many of its candidates continued to use this name.\n As a result of World War I and the Conscription Crisis of 1917, the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the \"Unionist Party\", led by Robert Borden from 1917 to 1920, and then the \"National Liberal and Conservative Party\" until 1922. It then reverted to \"Liberal-Conservative Party\" until 1938, when it became simply the \"National Conservative Party\". It ran in the 1940 election as \"National Government\" even though it was in opposition.\n The party was almost always referred to as simply the \"Conservative Party\" or Tories.",

  "/wiki/Papal_Army": "The Papal States (Italian: Stato Pontificio), officially the State of the Church (Italian: Stato della Chiesa, Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8sta\u02d0to della \u02c8kj\u025b\u02d0za; \u02c8kje\u02d0-]; Latin: Status Ecclesiasticus; also Dicio Pontificia) were a series of territories in the Italian Peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope, from the 8th century until 1870. They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia successfully unified the Italian Peninsula by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio (which includes Rome), Marche, Umbria and Romagna, and portions of Emilia. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope, as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n By 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the Pope's temporal control. In 1870, the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the Basilica of St Peter and the papal residence and related buildings around the Vatican quarter of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, ended the crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty, signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created international territorial entity, the Vatican City State, limited to a token territory.",

The same year, with his parents, L\u00e9o moved to Sorel, Quebec, because of his father's work in Ottawa as a civil servant. Leo managed the Molson Bank in Ville St-Pierre until the outbreak of the First World War.  He served with the Royal 22nd Battalion, CEF, during World War I, as an infantry officer, where he was severely wounded. In one instance, on June 17, 1916, a soldier in L\u00e9o's battalion noticed him lying in a field, left for dead. The soldier and four of his comrades transported the dying L\u00e9o on a stretcher as they crossed a battlefield under German artillery fire. The General in charge spotted the heroic act and as a result, the five soldiers were each awarded a Military Medal. In 1917, L\u00e9o was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the L\u00e9gion d'honneur of France for his service. He later became a lieutenant-colonel commanding the District Depot No. 4, Montreal which consisted of roughly 70,000 men. He would achieve the rank of major general. He co-founded the Canadian Legion in 1925 and became dominion president of the Canadian Legion in 1929. From 1932 to 1939, he was Deputy Minister of National Defence, Vice-Chairman Defence Council and briefly served as military attach\u00e9 to Paris before the German invasion.\n From 1940 to 1942, he was the associate deputy minister of War Services and was chairman of the National Film Board from 1941 to 1943. In 1941, he received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Ottawa.\n He was elected as the Liberal candidate to the House of Commons of Canada for the Quebec electoral district of Outremont in a by-election on November 30, 1942, called after the MP at the time, Thomas Vien, resigned. He defeated future mayor of Montreal Jean Drapeau who was running for the Bloc Populaire. Later that year, Prime minister Mackenzie King named him Minister of National War Services, a post he kept until he became the first Canadian ambassador to Greece on April 17, 1945, a post he kept until 1949.\n On October 20, 1949, he presented his credentials to the governor general of Australia as the new high commissioner of Canada. On August 19, 1952, he also held this position in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as he officially took his post as the Canadian ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary in charge of the diplomatic relations with neighbouring Uruguay. He returned to Canada in 1955. He died the next year at the age of 67. His grave is in the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery of Montreal.",
  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada (French: Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada. The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history,  holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century\u2014more than any other party in a developed country\u2014and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's \"natural governing party\".\n The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), occupying the centre-left to left.  Like their federal Conservative Party rivals, the party is often described as a \"big tent\", attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the \"radical centre\".\n The Liberals' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and reproductive choice.\n In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election, winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons.

On 1 April 1966, as a precursor to the unification of Canada's armed services, all land forces, plus RCAF tactical units, were placed under a new command called Force Mobile Command. The \"Canadian Army\" persisted as a legal entity for two more years, before it amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force to form a single service called the Canadian Armed Forces.

He commanded the 10th Infantry Brigade during the Fenian Raids and was awarded a medal for his conduct. He served as aide de camp to Lord Stanley of Preston and to Lord Aberdeen, was colonel of the 61st Regiment in 1903 and was the regiment's Honorary Colonel in 1909.\n He won a seat in the Quebec Legislative Assembly in 1875 but the election was overturned a year later. He served as president of the Conservative Party Association of Quebec for several years and was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1878 as a Conservative representing Montmagny, Quebec. He was re-elected in the 1882 election but was defeated in 1887.\n In 1892 he was summoned to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and sat as a Conservative. He also served as Mayor of Limoilou in 1899.\n After the 1911 federal election brought the Conservatives into power after a fifteen-year absence, the new prime minister, Robert Laird Borden, appointed Landry to be Speaker of the Senate.\n Landry was a prolific author and editor who wrote a number of books on matters of public policy in addition to his writings on agriculture. He was particularly concerned with the rights of French Canadians living outside of Quebec, particularly Franco-Manitobans and Franco-Ontarians and their rights in regards to the Manitoba Schools Question and a similar debate on publicly funded francophone schools in Ontario.\n His interests in these questions made him a controversial figure as Speaker when the Senate was considering the issue of francophone schools in Ontario in the wake of the provincial Conservative government's passage of Regulation 17 which restricted French-language instruction. Landry felt passionately about the issue and accepted a position as President of the Franco-Ontarian Association d'\u00e9ducation while he was Speaker. Many of Landry's rulings were challenged on the floor of the Senate with several being put to a vote in a departure from the normal practice of accepting a Speaker's ruling as final. In the face of his diminished authority over the upper house and the fact that many of his rulings were being overturned, he absented himself from the Chair for several days which resulted in calls for the government to dismiss him if he did not resume the Chair. Upon his return, explained that he had absented himself due to the opposition by a number of government members to his rulings and the lack of support he enjoyed. Landry continued as Speaker for a further year before resigning. He remained a Senator until his death three years later in Quebec City and devoted much of his time writing and campaigning on the issue of French-language rights in Ontario.",

  "/wiki/British_Army": "The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom, a part of British Armed Forces. As of 2019[update], the British Army comprises just over 79,300 trained regular (full-time) personnel and just over 27,200 trained reserve (part-time) personnel.\n The modern British Army traces back to 1707, with an antecedent in the English Army that was created during the Restoration in 1660. The term British Army was adopted in 1707 after the Acts of Union between England and Scotland. Members of the British Army swear allegiance to the monarch as their commander-in-chief, but the Bill of Rights of 1689 requires parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a peacetime standing army. Therefore, Parliament approves the army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years. The army is administered by the Ministry of Defence and commanded by the Chief of the General Staff.\n The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world's great powers, including the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars. Britain's victories in these decisive wars allowed it to influence world events and establish itself as one of the world's leading military and economic powers. Since the end of the Cold War, the British Army has been deployed to a number of conflict zones, often as part of an expeditionary force, a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation.",

  "/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Canada": "The Progressive Party of Canada was a federal-level political party in Canada in the 1920s until 1930. It was linked with the provincial United Farmers parties in several provinces, and it spawned the Progressive Party of Saskatchewan, and the Progressive Party of Manitoba, which formed the government of that province. The Progressive Party was part of the farmers' political movement that included federal and provincial Progressive and United Farmers' parties.\n The United Farmers movement in Canada rose to prominence after World War I. With the failure of the wartime Union government to alter a tariff structure that hurt farmers, various farmers movements across Canada became more radical and entered the political arena. The United Farmers movement was tied to the federal Progressive Party of Canada and formed provincial governments in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba. It rejected the National Policy of the Conservatives, and felt that the Liberals were not strong enough proponents of free trade and were too strongly tied to business interests. Generally, farmers groups formed alliances with Labour and socialist groups though, in power, they became closer to the Liberals causing ruptures in several provinces between United Farmer governments and their organizations.",
