He studied music as a child and, at the age of eighteen, was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris on 12 May 1806, where he studied violin under Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck and harmony under Charles Simon Catel.\n He created a group of musicians who were attempting to develop a way of transmitting language through music. Sudre trained \u00c9douard Deldevez and Charles Larsonneur to play and interpret his alphabet. A given note would represent a word or a letter of the alphabet. The trio toured France, answering questions from the audience using Sudre's violin. A military application quickly presented itself. A bugler on a battlefield could transmit orders to a regiment by playing an appropriate tune. This promising hypothesis came to nothing because the system was too vulnerable to wind and weather.\n Clearly grasping at straws, Sudre then offered the military a set of musical canons, but they declined the suggestion. In 1829 Sudre began to develop the system that is now known as the Do Re Mi method of notating music.",

Solf\u00e8ge is a form of solmization, and though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, this system originated from other \"Eastern\" music cultures such as swara, durar mufa\u1e63\u1e63al\u0101t and Jianpu. \n Syllables are assigned to the notes of the scale and enable the musician to audiate, or mentally hear, the pitches of a piece of music which he or she is seeing for the first time and then to sing them aloud. Through the Renaissance (and much later in some shapenote publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note systems were employed to cover the octave. The tonic sol-fa method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries: do (or doh in tonic sol-fa), re, mi, fa, so(l), la, and si (or ti), see below).\n There are two current ways of applying solf\u00e8ge: 1) fixed do, where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches (e.g. \"do\" is always \"C-natural\") and 2) movable do, where the syllables are assigned to scale degrees (\"do\" is always the first degree of the major scale).",

It was created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, when he published a book detailing the language, Unua Libro (\"First Book\"), under the pseudonym \"Dr. Esperanto\". The word esperanto translates into English as \"one who hopes\".\n Zamenhof's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster world peace and international understanding, and to build a community of speakers, as he believed that one could not have a language without such a community.\n His original title for the language was simply \"the international language\" (lingvo internacia), but early speakers grew fond of the name Esperanto and began to use it as the name for the language just two years after its creation; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since.\n In 1905, Zamenhof published Fundamento de Esperanto as a definitive guide to the language. Later that year, he organized the first World Esperanto Congress, an ongoing annual conference, in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. The first congress ratified the Declaration of Boulogne, which established several foundational premises for the Esperanto movement; one of its pronouncements is that Fundamento de Esperanto is the only obligatory authority over the language; another is that the Esperanto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it. Zamenhof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of Esperanto, foreshadowing the founding of the Akademio de Esperanto (in part modeled after the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise), which was established soon thereafter. Since 1905, the congress has been held in a different country every year, with the exceptions of those years during the World Wars. In 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers led by the Swiss Hector Hodler established the Universal Esperanto Association in order to provide a central organization for the global Esperanto community.\n Esperanto grew throughout the 20th century, both as a language and as a linguistic community. Despite speakers facing persecution in regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union under Stalin, Esperanto speakers continued to establish organizations and publish periodicals tailored to specific regions and interests. In 1954, the United Nations granted official support to Esperanto as an international auxiliary language in the Montevideo Resolution. Several writers have contributed to the growing body of Esperanto literature, including William Auld, who received the first nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature for a literary work in Esperanto in 1999, followed by two more, in 2004 and 2006. Those writing in Esperanto are also officially represented in PEN International, the worldwide writers association, through Esperanto PEN Centro.\n The development of Esperanto has continued unabated into the 21st century. The advent of the Internet has had a significant impact on the language, as learning it has become increasingly accessible on platforms such as Duolingo, and as speakers have increasingly networked on platforms such as Amikumu. With approximately two million speakers, a small portion of whom are even native speakers, it is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world. Although no country has adopted Esperanto officially, Esperantujo is the name given to the collection of places where it is spoken, and the language is widely employed in world travel, correspondence, cultural exchange, conventions, literature, language instruction, television, and radio. Some people have chosen to learn Esperanto for its purported help in third language acquisition, like Latin.\n While many of its advocates continue to hope for the day that Esperanto becomes officially recognized as the international auxiliary language, an increasing number have stopped focusing on this goal and instead view the Esperanto community as a \"stateless diasporic linguistic minority\" based on freedom of association, with a culture worthy of preservation, based solely on its own merit.",

He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war. He believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language. The language would be a tool to gather people together through neutral, fair, equitable communication. He successfully formed a community that continues today despite the World Wars of the 20th century. Also, it has developed like other languages, through the interaction and creativity of its users. \n In light of his achievements, and his support of intercultural dialogue, UNESCO selected Zamenhof as one of its eminent personalities of 2017, on the 100th anniversary of his death.",
  "/wiki/Spokil": "Spokil is a constructed language created by the Frenchman Adolphe Nicolas.\n During the 1880s, the most popular international auxiliary language was undeniably Volap\u00fck. However, after a brief period of overwhelming success, rivalry on the part of the more practical and less complicated Esperanto (published in 1887) led to a rapid decline of the Volap\u00fck movement. Many who had previously supported Volap\u00fck switched to the Esperanto camp, while others tried their best to improve or reform Volap\u00fck itself. Partially due to the inflexible attitude of Johann Martin Schleyer, the creator of Volap\u00fck, himself, this led to several schisms in the Volap\u00fck movement. As a result, a number of so-called \"Volap\u00fckids\" emerged, most notably Idiom Neutral, first published in 1902, and Spokil.\n Spokil was created by Adolphe Charles Antoine Marie Nicolas (1833-?), a French ship's doctor from La Bourboule. A former partisan of Volap\u00fck, he started working on Spokil in 1890 (though some sources mention 1887 instead). In 1904, he published a book about it: Spokil. Language internationale. Grammaire, exercise, les deux dictionnaires. At a conference in Paris, held in June 1907, Nicolas was allowed to defend his language in person; among the other languages discussed at the conference were Parla, Bolak (La Langue Bleue), Idiom Neutral, and Esperanto. At the same meeting, Ido was first presented.

In this sense, Ido is classified as a constructed international auxiliary language. It is the most successful of many Esperanto derivatives, called Esperantidos.\n Ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in Esperanto, a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication. The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word ido, meaning \"offspring\", since the language is a \"descendant\" of Esperanto. After its inception, Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community, but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents, Louis Couturat, it declined in popularity. There were two reasons for this: first, the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects; and second, a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language. These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum.\n Ido uses the same 26 letters as the English (Latin) alphabet, with no diacritics.

The vocabulary is based on already existing words from various languages and a system of derivation using recognized prefixes and suffixes. The language is thereby naturalistic, at the same time as it is constructed to be regular. Occidental was quite popular in the years up to, during, and shortly after the Second World War, but declined thereafter.\n Occidental is devised so that many of its derived word forms reflect the forms common to a number of Western European languages, primarily those in the Romance family, along with a certain amount of Germanic vocabulary. Many words were formed through application of de Wahl's rule, a set of rules for regular conversion of verb infinitives into derived words including from double-stem verbs of Latin origin (e.g. vider to see and its derivative vision). The result is a language easy to understand at first sight for individuals acquainted with several Western European languages. This readability and simplified grammar along with the regular appearance of the magazine Cosmoglotta made Occidental popular in Europe during the 15 years before World War II.\n In The Esperanto Book, Don Harlow says that Occidental had an intentional emphasis on European forms, and that some of its leading followers espoused a Eurocentric philosophy, which may have hindered its spread. Still, Occidental gained adherents in many nations including Asian nations.\n Occidental survived World War II, undergoing a name change to Interlingue, but faded into insignificance following the appearance in 1951 of a competing naturalistic project, Interlingua, which attracted among others the notable Occidentalist Ric Berger. The emergence of Interlingua occurred around the same time that Edgar de Wahl, who had opted to remain in Tallinn, was sent to a sanitarium by Soviet authorities and was not permitted to correspond with Occidentalists in Western Europe. His death was confirmed in 1948.

The word Sona in the language itself means \"auxiliary neutral thing\", but the name was also chosen to echo \"sonority\" or \"sound\".[citation needed]\n Searight created Sona as a response to the Eurocentricity of other artificial auxiliary languages of his time, such as Esperanto and Ido. At the same time, Searight intended his language to be more practical than most a priori languages like Solresol or Ro, which were intended to be unbiased by any particular group of natural languages.  Thus, Sona sacrificed familiarity of grammar and lexicon for some measure of \"universality\", while at the same time preserving basic notions common to grammars around the world such as compounding as a method of word formation. Searight used inspiration from many diverse languages, including English, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Japanese, to create his eclectic yet regular and logical language.\n Searight specifically chose only sounds that speakers of many languages could say, therefore making it a true universal. He hoped that in a perfect world, Sona would be taught to young children everywhere.\n Sona is an agglutinative language with a strong tendency towards being an isolating language. The language has 360 radicals or root words whose meanings are based on the categories in Roget's original thesaurus, plus an additional 15 particles.

Forster's world-view, particularly with regard to soldiers.\n Searight was born in Kensington, England in 1883. He attended Charterhouse School (a boarding school) for his childhood and teenage years. In 1904 he received a commission into the Queen's Own Western Kent Regiment, and was stationed for several years in India. It was here that he befriended English author E.M.

Searight also enjoyed leave time around the Mediterranean Sea\u2014especially in Italy.\n It was during this extensive travel that Searight developed his interest in linguistics and his familiarity with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern languages and cultures. At one point in his military career he was classified as an interpreter competent in \"Arabic, Baluchi, Persian and Pushtu.\"\n Searight retired to Rome in 1926. In 1934 he contacted Charles Kay Ogden to discuss publishing the Sona book. Ogden was the creator of a modified version of English known as \"Basic English\", which consisted of a reduced vocabulary (only 850 words) and simplified grammar. Ogden was also the editor of the Psyche Miniatures series at Cambridge University, and he approved and published the Sona book, as well as writing an introduction for it.\n Searight was gay.

Esperanto II was one of several languages investigated by the International Auxiliary Language Association, the linguistic research body that eventually standardized and presented Interlingua de IALA.\n Several of the grammatical inflections were changed. The accusative is in -u, which replaces the final vowel of nouns, pronouns, and correlatives (ju for \u011din, tu for tion), and for the plural -n is added to both nouns and pronouns (lin \"they\", lina \"their\"). Neither suffix affects adjectives, which do not agree with their noun. The correlative series tiu, \u0109iu becomes ta, cha when modifying a noun. The indefinite suffix -a\u016d is replaced with adverbial -e, and the inchoative -i\u011d- becomes -ev-.\n Many small grammatical words are also replaced, such as ey for kaj \"and\", be for \u0109e \"at\", and ki for ol \"than\". The work of the preposition de \"of, by, from\" is divided up into several more specific prepositions.\n Additionally, the project introduced international cognates when such cognates were readily recognized; for example, skolo was used for \"school\" in place of standard Esperanto's lernejo (a derivation of lerni, \"to learn\"); Esperanto has skolo only in the sense of \"a school of thought\", which is also the eaning that the word has in the example passage below. Antonymic roots such as tarde for malfrue \"late\" and poke for malmulte \"few\" are used today in Esperanto poetry, though they resemble Ido and Esperanto may have acquired them from that language.",
  "/wiki/Ren\u00e9_de_Saussure": "Ren\u00e9 de Saussure (17 March 1868 \u2013 2 December 1943) was a Swiss Esperantist and professional mathematician (he defended in 1895 a doctoral thesis on a subject in geometry in Geneva), who composed important works about Esperanto and interlinguistics from a linguistic viewpoint. He was born in Geneva, Switzerland. His chef d'oeuvre is an analysis on the logic of word construction in Esperanto, Fundamentaj reguloj de la vortteorio en Esperanto (\"Fundamental rules of word theory in Esperanto\"), defending the language against several Idist critiques. He developed the concept of neceso kaj sufi\u0109o (\"necessity and sufficience\") by which he opposed the criticism of Louis Couturat that Esperanto lacks recursion.",
  "/wiki/Mondial_(language)": "Mondial is an international auxiliary language created by the Swedish school principal Helge Heimer, in the 1940s. It received favourable reviews from several academic linguists but achieved little practical success. Grammars and dictionaries were published in Swedish, French, English, Italian, and German.",
  "/wiki/Glosa": "Glosa is an international auxiliary language based on a previous draft auxiliary called Interglossa. Glosa is an isolating language, which means that words never change form, and spelling is completely regular and phonetic.\n As an isolating language, there are no inflections, so that words always remain in their dictionary form, no matter what function they have in the sentence. Consequently, grammatical functions, when not clear from the context, are taken over by a small number of operator words and by the use of word order (syntax).\n Being an a posteriori language, Glosa takes most of its vocabulary from Greek and Latin roots, seen by the authors as international in a sense by their usage in science.",
  "/wiki/Lancelot_Hogben": "Lancelot Thomas Hogben FRS FRSE (9 December 1895 \u2013 22 August 1975) was a British experimental zoologist and medical statistician. He developed the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) as a model organism for biological research in his early career, attacked the eugenics movement in the middle of his career, and popularised books on science, mathematics and language in his later career.",
  "/wiki/Blissymbols": "Blissymbols or Blissymbolics is a constructed language conceived as an ideographic writing system called Semantography consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language.\n Blissymbols was published by Charles K. Bliss in 1949 and found use in the education of people with communication difficulties.",
  "/wiki/Charles_Bliss": "Charles K. Bliss (1897\u20131985) was a chemical engineer and semiotician, and the inventor of Blissymbolics. He was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and later gained Australian citizenship.",
