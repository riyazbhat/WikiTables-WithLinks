Sudre was born in Albi in southern France on 15 August 1787. He studied music as a child and, at the age of eighteen, was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris on 12 May 1806, where he studied violin under Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck and harmony under Charles Simon Catel. He created a group of musicians who were attempting to develop a way of transmitting language through music. Sudre trained \u00c9douard Deldevez and Charles Larsonneur to play and interpret his alphabet. A given note would represent a word or a letter of the alphabet. The trio toured France, answering questions from the audience using Sudre's violin. A military application quickly presented itself.",

Solf\u00e8ge is a form of solmization, and though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, this system originated from other \"Eastern\" music cultures such as swara, durar mufa\u1e63\u1e63al\u0101t and Jianpu. \n Syllables are assigned to the notes of the scale and enable the musician to audiate, or mentally hear, the pitches of a piece of music which he or she is seeing for the first time and then to sing them aloud. Through the Renaissance (and much later in some shapenote publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note systems were employed to cover the octave. The tonic sol-fa method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries: do (or doh in tonic sol-fa), re, mi, fa, so(l), la, and si (or ti), see below).\n There are two current ways of applying solf\u00e8ge: 1) fixed do, where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches (e.g. \"do\" is always \"C-natural\") and 2) movable do, where the syllables are assigned to scale degrees (\"do\" is always the first degree of the major scale).",

The word esperanto translates into English as \"one who hopes\". Zamenhof's goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster world peace and international understanding, and to build a community of speakers, as he believed that one could not have a language without such a community. His original title for the language was simply \"the international language\" (lingvo internacia), but early speakers grew fond of the name Esperanto and began to use it as the name for the language just two years after its creation; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since. In 1905, Zamenhof published Fundamento de Esperanto as a definitive guide to the language. Later that year, he organized the first World Esperanto Congress, an ongoing annual conference, in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. The first congress ratified the Declaration of Boulogne, which established several foundational premises for the Esperanto movement; one of its pronouncements is that Fundamento de Esperanto is the only obligatory authority over the language; another is that the Esperanto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it.",
