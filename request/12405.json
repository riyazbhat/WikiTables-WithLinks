  "/wiki/Effective_radiated_power": "Effective radiated power (ERP), synonymous with equivalent radiated power,  is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency (RF) power, such as that emitted by a radio transmitter.  It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam (main lobe).  ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.   It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna.  It is used in electronics and telecommunications, particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area.",

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format. Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format. It is considered the successor to the oldies format, a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States. The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format, which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs. In addition, adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists, playing a given song only a few times per week, compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations. For example,  KRTH, a classic hits station in Los Angeles, plays power songs up to 30 times a week, which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries.",

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock, alt-pop or simply alternative) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s. In this instance, the word \"alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream, or commercial rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, DIY ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. In September of 1988, Billboard magazine introduced \"Alternative Songs\" into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts. By then \"alternative\" had become a catch-all description for both successful artists (e.g. U2 and R.E.M.), as well as music from underground, independent, or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition. Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s, music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s, with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett. Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music.",
