Rolling Stone called her one of the greatest songwriters ever, and AllMusic has stated, When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century. Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before busking in the streets and nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. In 1965, she moved to the United States and began touring. Some of her original songs (Urge for Going, Chelsea Morning, Both Sides, Now, The Circle Game) were covered by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, Song to a Seagull, in 1968.

German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt wrote that Haden's ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman's free-form solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing. His virtuosity lies\u2026in an incredible ability to make the double bass 'sound out'. Haden cultivated the instrument's gravity as no one else in jazz. He is a master of simplicity which is one of the most difficult things to achieve. ) Haden played a vital role in this revolutionary new approach, evolving a way of playing that sometimes complemented the soloist and sometimes moved independently.",

The 1978 recording Music for 18 Musicians would help entrench minimalism as a movement. Reich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage, notably  Different Trains (1988).\n Reich's style of composition has influenced many contemporary composers and groups, especially in the US.
