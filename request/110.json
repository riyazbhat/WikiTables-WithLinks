  "/wiki/Edward_Jenner": "Edward Jenner, FRS FRCPE (17 May 1749 \u2013 26 January 1823) was an English physician who was a contributor to development of the smallpox vaccine. The practice of vaccination was popularized by Jenner, and since then has been used ubiquitously to prevent several diseases. The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.",

As a biological discipline, the scope of parasitology is not determined by the organism or environment in question but by their way of life.
