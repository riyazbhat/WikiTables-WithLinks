  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead.",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering, a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work. In locomotives, the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion. In an engine-generator set, the engine is the prime mover, as distinct from the generator.",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power, or the rate at which work is done, usually in reference to the output of engines or motors. There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is about 745.7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts.",
  "/wiki/EMC_TA": "The EMC-TA was a model of Diesel locomotive produced for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad by the Electro-Motive Corporation in 1937. The original six Rock Island Rocket streamliners were three- or four-car stainless-steel semi-articulated trainsets built by Budd Company, powered by six identical locomotives, #601-606. The locomotives were classified as model TA\u2014the T indicating Twelve hundred\u00a0hp (890\u00a0kW), the A indicating an A unit (cab-equipped lead locomotive).  The Rock Island Line was EMC's only customer for the TA locomotive model.",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis.",
  "/wiki/EMC_EA/EB": "The EMC EA/EB was an early passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive built in May 16, 1937 \u2013 1938 by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.[page\u00a0needed] They were the first model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. Each locomotive unit developed 1,800 horsepower (1,300\u00a0kW) from two 900\u00a0hp (670\u00a0kW) Winton 201-A diesel engines, driving the wheels through an electric transmission\u2014the generator driven by each engine provided current for traction motors. The locomotives were of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement\u2014two three-axle trucks of which only the outer two axles were powered. Six two-unit 3,600\u00a0hp (2,700\u00a0kW) locomotives were produced, each consisting of a lead cab-equipped EA A unit and a cabless booster EB B unit. They were numbered 51 through 56; the A units bore the bare number and the B units the number followed by 'X'.",
  "/wiki/A_unit": "An A unit, in railroad terminology, is a diesel locomotive (or more rarely an electric locomotive) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit, and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position. This terminology is generally used in North America, since only there was it commonplace to build B units\u2014cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train.",
  "/wiki/B_unit": "A B unit, in railroad terminology, is a locomotive unit (generally a diesel locomotive) which does not have a control cab or crew compartment, and must therefore be operated in tandem with another coupled locomotive with a cab (an A unit). The terms booster unit and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, locomotives without driving cabs are rare.",
  "/wiki/EMC_E1": "The EMC E1 was an early passenger-train diesel locomotive developing 1,800\u00a0hp, with an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois. They were built during 1937 and 1938 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway for a new generation of diesel-powered streamlined trains. 8 cab-equipped lead A units and three cabless booster B units were built. The initial three locomotives were AB pairs built to haul the Santa Fe's Super Chief diesel streamliners, while the others were built as single A units to haul shorter trains. The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two 900\u00a0hp (670\u00a0kW) Winton 201-A engines each, with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors. The E1 was the second model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.  All Winton 201A-engined Santa Fe passenger units, including the E1s, were extensively rebuilt into the 80-class E8M engines in 1952-53.  These were similar to production E8 models, but derated to 2000\u00a0hp so as not to burn out the early traction (axle) motors (which were reused).",
  "/wiki/EMC_E2": "The EMC E2 was an American passenger-train diesel locomotive which as a single unit developed 1,800 horsepower (1,300\u00a0kW), from two (2) 900 horsepower (670\u00a0kW) prime movers.  These locomotives were typically operated as a unit set (A - B - B); where the three unit lashup developed 5400 horsepower. This was almost the ideal horsepower required (6,000 horsepower or 4,500 kilowatts) for the tonnage of a 15 - 18 car passenger train, operated over the ruling grades of virtually all of the mileage between major American cities.  The units were of the A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC), later Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) of La Grange, Illinois.",
  "/wiki/EMC_E3": "The EMC E3 is a 2,000 horsepower (1,500\u00a0kW), A1A-A1A passenger train locomotive that was manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois. The EMC demonstrator #822 was released from La Grange for test on September 12, 1938. The cab version, or E3A, was manufactured from September 1938 to June 1940, and 17 were produced. The booster version, or E3B, was manufactured in March 1939 and September 1939, and 2 were produced. The 2,000\u00a0hp (1,500\u00a0kW) was achieved by putting two 1,000 horsepower (750\u00a0kW), 12-cylinder, model 567 engines in the engine compartment. Each engine drove its own electrical generator to power the traction motors. The E3 was the fourth model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.",

  "/wiki/EMC_AA": "AA was a designator used for several different diesel locomotive types custom built by General Motors Corporation EMC/GM with passenger or baggage space in the same body.  This locomotive is listed as class AA-6 by R. Craig, and the designation is logical as the locomotive is described as \"half an E6\" in the Second Diesel Spotter's Guide.",
  "/wiki/EMC_AB6": "The EMC AB6 was a type of diesel locomotive built exclusively for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the \"Rock Island Line\") by General Motors' Electro-Motive Corporation and delivered in June 1940. Two examples were built, numbered #750 and #751.  They were built for the Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger train, which travelled as a unified train from Chicago, Illinois, to Limon, Colorado, which then divided. One section went to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the other to Denver, Colorado. The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route, and could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs.  A regular, cab-equipped A-unit could have been purchased, but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train, so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an E-series E6B (B unit) but with an operating cab, headlight, pilot, and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive.",

The E5 was distinguished from the otherwise very similar E3, E4 and E6 by being clad in polished stainless steel to match the Burlington's Zephyr trains. It also featured unique small grill-like ornamentation on both sides of the upper headlight. Like the other models in the \u00c9-series, the E5 had a sloping \u201cslant nose\u201d and it was equipped with two headlights \u2014 a regular stationary headlight above a gyrating \"Mars\" signal light.

The E9 was the tenth and last model of EMD E-unit and differed from the earlier E8 as built only by the newer engines and a different, flusher-fitting mounting for the headlight glass, the latter being the only visible difference. Since some E8s were fitted with this, it is not a reliable way to distinguish the two."
