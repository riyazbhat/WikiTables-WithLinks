  "/wiki/Gagaku": "Gagaku (\u96c5\u697d, imperial court music and dances, lit. \"elegant music\") is a type of Japanese classical music that has been performed at the Imperial Court in Kyoto for several centuries since the 7th century. It is today performed by the Board of Ceremonies in the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

  "/wiki/Noh": "Noh (\u80fd, N\u014d, derived from the Sino-Japanese word for \"skill\" or \"talent\"), is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami, it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today. Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably, n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen. Traditionally, a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today. Optionally, an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation.",

  "/wiki/Japanese_traditional_dance": "Japanese traditional dance has a long history, the oldest known ones may be among those transmitted through the kagura tradition, or folk dances relating to food producing activities such as planting rice (dengaku) and fishing, including rain dances.  There are large number of these traditional dances, which are often subfixed -odori, -asobi, and -mai, and may be specific to a region or village. Mai and Odori are the two main groups of Japanese dances, and the term Buy\u014d (\u821e\u8e0a) was coined in modern times as a general term for dance, by combining mai (\u821e, which can also be pronounced bu) and odori (\u8e0a, can also be pronounced y\u014d).",

It begins with early dance traditions such as mai and odori, with major development in the early Edo period (early 17th century) in the form of kabuki dances, which incorporated elements from the older dance genres. Although the term Nihon buy\u014d means \"Japanese dance\", it is not meant to refer to Japanese dance in general, rather it refers to a few dance genres such as kabuki buy\u014d performed in theatre, Kamigata mai that encompasses the style of dancing performed by geisha, as well as some Japanese dances with modern choreography. Nihon buy\u014d differs from other Japanese traditional dances in that it is a more refined style of dancing intended as entertainment on a public stage or in private functions.",

Japan's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music, such as Gagaku (court music) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d (Buddhist chanting), but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku, in a broad sense, as the form from which the others were derived. Outside of ethnomusicology, however, H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century. Within this framework, there are three types of traditional music in Japan: theatrical, court music (called gagaku), and instrumental.",
