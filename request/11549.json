  "/wiki/Imperial_Household_Agency": "The Imperial Household Agency (\u5bae\u5185\u5e81, Kunai-ch\u014d) is an agency of the government of Japan in charge of state matters concerning the Imperial Family, and also keeping of the Privy Seal and State Seal of Japan. From around the 8th century AD up to the Second World War, it was named the Imperial Household Ministry (\u5bae\u5185\u7701, Kunai-sh\u014d). The agency is unique among conventional government agencies and ministries, in that it does not directly report to the Prime Minister at the cabinet level, nor is it affected by legislation that establishes it as an Independent Administrative Institution.",
  "/wiki/Gagaku": "Gagaku (\u96c5\u697d, imperial court music and dances, lit. elegant music) is a type of Japanese classical music that has been performed at the Imperial Court in Kyoto for several centuries since the 7th century. It is today performed by the Board of Ceremonies in the Tokyo Imperial Palace. This kind of music was first imported into Japan from China; however, artistically it differs from the music of the corresponding Chinese form yayue which is a term reserved for ceremonial music. Gagaku consists of three primary repertoires:",
  "/wiki/Noh": "Noh (\u80fd, N\u014d, derived from the Sino-Japanese word for skill or talent), is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami, it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today. Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably, n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen. Traditionally, a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today. Optionally, an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation. Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story. Noh integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts, women, children, and the elderly. Written in late middle Japanese, the text vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries. [attribution needed] Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, Noh is extremely codified and regulated by the iemoto system.",
  "/wiki/Bunraku": "Bunraku (\u6587\u697d), also known as Ningy\u014d j\u014druri (\u4eba\u5f62\u6d44\u7460\u7483), is a form of traditional Japanese puppet theatre, founded in Osaka in the beginning of the 17th century. Three kinds of performers take part in a bunraku performance: the Ningy\u014dtsukai or Ningy\u014dzukai (puppeteers), the Tay\u016b (chanters), and shamisen musicians. Occasionally other instruments such as taiko drums will be used. The most accurate term for the traditional puppet theater in Japan is ningy\u014d j\u014druri (\u4eba\u5f62\u6d44\u7460\u7483). The combination of chanting and shamisen playing is called j\u014druri and the Japanese word for puppet (or dolls, generally) is ningy\u014d. It is used in many plays. Bunraku puppetry has been a documented traditional activity for Japanese people for hundreds of years.",
  "/wiki/Kabuki": "Kabuki (\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e) is a classical Japanese dance-drama. Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers. In 2005, the Kabuki theatre was proclaimed by UNESCO as an intangible heritage possessing outstanding universal value. In 2008, it was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.",
  "/wiki/Japanese_traditional_dance": "Japanese traditional dance has a long history, the oldest known ones may be among those transmitted through the kagura tradition, or folk dances relating to food producing activities such as planting rice (dengaku) and fishing, including rain dances. There are large number of these traditional dances, which are often subfixed -odori, -asobi, and -mai, and may be specific to a region or village. Mai and Odori are the two main groups of Japanese dances, and the term Buy\u014d (\u821e\u8e0a) was coined in modern times as a general term for dance, by combining mai (\u821e, which can also be pronounced bu) and odori (\u8e0a, can also be pronounced y\u014d). Mai is a more reserved genre of dance that often has circling movements, and dances of the Noh theatre are of this tradition. A variation of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the Kyomai or Kyoto-style dance. Kyomai developed in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. It is heavily influenced by the elegance and sophistication of the manners often associated with the Imperial Court in Kyoto. [citation needed] Odori has more vigorous stepping movements and is more energetic, and dances of the kabuki theatre belong to this category.",
  "/wiki/Kumi_Odori": "Kumi odori (\u7d44\u8e0a, Okinawan: Kumi wudui) is a form of narrative traditional Ry\u016bky\u016ban dance. Kumi odori or Kumi wudui means combination dance or ensemble dance. Originating in the Ry\u016bky\u016ban capital of Shuri, Okinawa in 1719, the original purpose of this dance was to provide amusement and diversions, which were termed ukwanshin, for the Chinese diplomats who traveled to Ry\u016bky\u016b. Tamagusuku Chokun, a Ry\u016bky\u016ban courtier who lived from 1684-1734, is credited with the establishment of kumi odori as a frequently presented court demonstration. An amalgamation of several different types of East Asian dance, the kumi odori has continued to hold a place in Okinawan culture, and is now recognized by the Japanese government as an Important Intangible Cultural Property. In 2010 it was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It remains today a prime example of native art sustained by the people of Okinawa.",
  "/wiki/Buy\u014d": "Buy\u014d (\u821e\u8e0a), or Nichibu (\u65e5\u821e) short for Nihon buy\u014d/Nippon buy\u014d (\u65e5\u672c\u821e\u8e0a) meaning Japanese dance, refers to a traditional Japanese performing art that may be a dance sometimes mixed with pantomime. It begins with early dance traditions such as mai and odori, with major development in the early Edo period (early 17th century) in the form of kabuki dances, which incorporated elements from the older dance genres. Although the term Nihon buy\u014d means Japanese dance, it is not meant to refer to Japanese dance in general, rather it refers to a few dance genres such as kabuki buy\u014d performed in theatre, Kamigata mai that encompasses the style of dancing performed by geisha, as well as some Japanese dances with modern choreography. Nihon buy\u014d differs from other Japanese traditional dances in that it is a more refined style of dancing intended as entertainment on a public stage or in private functions. The term buy\u014d is a modern coinage during the Meiji period as a term for dance, and the writer Tsubouchi Sh\u014dy\u014d is believed to be the first to use the term Nihon buy\u014d. Prior to this, dance was generally referred according to its particular dance genre, such as mai and odori. The term is a combination of mai (\u821e, which can also be pronounced bu) and odori (\u8e0a, can also be pronounced y\u014d). Sh\u014dy\u014d intended Nihon buy\u014d to be a term for Furigoto Geki (\u632f\u4e8b\u5287), a form of dance drama in Kabuki plays, but it has now become a term that covers several Japanese dance styles, including the modern dance form Sosaku Buy\u014d. As a genre of dance that has multiple influences and borrowings from many different dance traditions that developed over a long period, one that overlaps with theatre and has many different schools, there is some difficulty in defining and categorizing Nihon buy\u014d.",
  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d (h\u014dgaku), meaning literally (home) country music (as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d (y\u014dgaku) - Western music) is the folk or traditional music of Japan. Japan's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music, such as Gagaku (court music) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d (Buddhist chanting), but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku, in a broad sense, as the form from which the others were derived. Outside of ethnomusicology, however, H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century. Within this framework, there are three types of traditional music in Japan: theatrical, court music (called gagaku), and instrumental.",
  "/wiki/J\u014druri_(music)": "J\u014druri (\u6d44\u7460\u7483) is a form of traditional Japanese narrative music in which a tay\u016b (\u592a\u592b) sings to the accompaniment of a shamisen. As a form of storytelling, the emphasis is on the lyrics and narration rather than the music itself. According to Asai Ry\u014di, the first to have ever employed the shamisen during his storytelling instead of the biwa was chanter Sawazumi. The story he narrated on that occasion was J\u014druri J\u016b-ni-dan z\u014dshi, one of the many existing versions of the J\u014druri Monogatari, which tells the tale of the tragic love between Minamoto no Yoshitsune and J\u014druri-hime. Following this event, every tale sung to the accompaniment of a shamisen is associated with J\u014druri."
