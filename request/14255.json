These wetlands and associated grasslands, complemented by two national wildlife refuges and four state wildlife areas, comprise over 160,000 acres (650 km2) and are collectively known as the Grasslands Ecological Area.\n This area is extremely important to Pacific Flyway populations of 19 duck species and 6 goose species. The Grasslands Ecological Area has been officially recognized as an integral unit of the Western Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network.\n Large concentrations of migratory waterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds are common and easily observed during late winter and early spring.",
