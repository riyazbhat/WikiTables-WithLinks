More specifically, it refers to the Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. Hanja-mal or Hanja-eo (the latter is used more often) refers to words that can be written with Hanja, and hanmun (\ud55c\ubb38, \u6f22\u6587) refers to Classical Chinese writing, although \"Hanja\" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because Hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to traditional Chinese and ky\u016bjitai characters, though the stroke orders for some characters are slightly different.
