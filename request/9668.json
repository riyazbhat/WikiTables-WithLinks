  "/wiki/Hangul": "The Korean alphabet, known as Hangul (Hangeul)[note 1] in South Korea or Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea, has been used to write the Korean language since its creation in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great. It is the official writing system of Korea, both South Korea and North Korea. It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau, Indonesia. A Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode (1987) developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien, and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin (see Taiwanese Hangul). The Hangul alphabet originally consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters when it was created. As four became obsolete, modern Hangul consists of a total of 24 letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters. In North Korea the total is counted 40. It consists of 19 consonant letters and 21 vowel letters as it additionally includes 5 tense consonants (\u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3149 \u3146) and 6 compound and complex vowel letters as well as \u3150 and \u3154. The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic letters arranged in two dimensions. For example, the Korean word for honeybee (kkulbeol) is written \uafc0\ubc8c, not \u3132\u315c\u3139\u3142\u3153\u3139. As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an alphabetic syllabary by some linguists.",
  "/wiki/Hanja": "Hanja (Korean: \ud55c\uc790; Hanja: \u6f22\u5b57; Korean pronunciation: [ha(\u02d0)nt\u0348\u0255a])[citation needed] is the Korean name for Chinese characters (Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57; pinyin: h\u00e0nz\u00ec). More specifically, it refers to the Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. Hanja-mal or Hanja-eo (the latter is used more often) refers to words that can be written with Hanja, and hanmun (\ud55c\ubb38, \u6f22\u6587) refers to Classical Chinese writing, although Hanja is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because Hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to traditional Chinese and ky\u016bjitai characters, though the stroke orders for some characters are slightly different.

Only a small number of Hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding Hanja characters. Although a phonetic Korean alphabet, now known as Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl or Hangul, had been created by Sejong the Great, it did not come into widespread official use until the late 19th and early 20th century. Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing Hanja to be literate in Korean, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most other Korean documents were written in Literary Chinese, using Hanja as its primary script. Today, a good working knowledge of Chinese characters is still important for anyone who wishes to study older texts (up to about the 1990s), or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities. Learning a certain number of Hanja is very helpful for understanding the etymology of Sino-Korean words, and for enlarging one's Korean vocabulary. Today, Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in Hangul, and even words of Chinese origin - Hanja-eo (\ud55c\uc790\uc5b4, \u6f22\u5b57\u8a9e) - are written with the Hangul alphabet most of the time, with the corresponding Chinese character often written next to it to prevent confusion with other characters or words with the same phonetics.",

This is a stone fortress built by the Japanese general, Kuroda Nagamasa who was defending this area against the Korean Joseon army, in about June, 1593, the second year of the Japanese Invasions. This wall-fortress built on the stronghold in the rear coast of the village of Jukseong-ri, was 11,176 pyeongs (pyeong=unit of area in the Joseon period) in area, about 300 m in circumference, 4 m in height, and three-storied. It has been called the Gijang fortress in Japan. It was placed at the strategically important point linking together the Seosaengpo Waeseong fortress in Ulsan, the Hakseong fortress and the Busanjinjiseong Fortress. Originally, it was built with the stones which had once constituted the Dumoposeong fortress, so there still remain the footstones of it in a row around the villages in Dumopo. Today, the surrounding areas of the fortress are used as farming fields, but the stone wall still remains maintaining its original state relatively well.",
  "/wiki/Busan": "Busan (Korean pronunciation: [pusan]), formerly romanized as Pusan and now officially Busan Metropolitan City, is South Korea's second most-populous city after Seoul, with a population of over 3.5 million inhabitants. It is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port - Korea's busiest and the fifth-busiest in the world [a] - only about 190 kilometers (120 mi) from the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Honshu. The surrounding Southeast Economic Zone (including Ulsan and South Gyeongsang) is South Korea's largest industrial area. Busan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million. The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest. Busan is a center for international conventions, hosting APEC in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City. Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Film in December 2014.",
  "/wiki/Busanjinjiseong": "The Branch Wall-fortress in Busanjin (also known as Jaseongdae) is located at Beomil-dong, Dong-gu, Busan Metropolitan City, the Republic of Korea.The existing wall-fortress remains were constructed by the Japanese military during the Japanese invasion of Korea (1592-1598). There are two assertions on the name of Jaseong (Subordinate Castle). One is that the wall-fortress on the current Mt. Jeungsan, Jwacheon-dong is the mother castle and accordingly called Jaseong. The other is that Jaseong was constructed on the mountain top as the General's terrace. The Busanjinjiseong Fortress was also called Mangongdae in memory of Ming-dynasty General Wan Shide who stayed at Jaseongdae to reinforce the Korean soldiers defending against the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-98). The wall-fortress was repaired after General Wan Shide returned home. It was used as Gyeongsangjwado Headquarters which later moved into its present location in Suyeong. It was also used as the Busanjin Naval Headquarters. The wall-fortress was removed by the Japanese during their forced occupation. Around this time the sea encircling Jaseongdae was filled with land, reducing Jaseongdae to a smaller site, however it was later repaired.",
