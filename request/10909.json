  "/wiki/Seo_Hee": "Hee Seo (Korean: \uc11c\ud76c; Hanja: \u5f90\u59ec; born 13 March 1986) is a South Korean principal dancer for American Ballet Theatre (ABT), one of the three leading classical ballet companies in the United States. She became the company's first Korean ballerina to be promoted to principal dancer in ABT's 75-year history and is one of only three principal dancers in the company who have worked their way up the ranks from the American Ballet Theatre Studio Company. She is also one of the youngest dancers in ABT history to be promoted to principal at the age of twenty-six. The New York Times has described her style and dancing to exude an unhurried purity that sums up all that is lovely about ballet and by Vogue as unspeakably lissome. Several critics have noted her style as lyrical and open and she has been critically acclaimed for her humility and unique feminine strength. Seo began training in Russian ballet at the age of twelve; a relatively late start for a ballet dancer. Seo has stated on numerous occasions that she did not have aspirations of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Her teachers identified her skills and talents early on and within a short period of time she was offered full scholarships to study abroad at prestigious ballet schools.",
