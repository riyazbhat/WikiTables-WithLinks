The musical had run for many years on the stage in both NYC and London. Audrey Hepburn, the female lead of the film, was controversially not nominated for Best Actress. The unpopularity of her replacing Julie Andrews \u2013 who had originated the role on Broadway and, coincidentally, the Best Actress winner of the year for Mary Poppins \u2013 as well as the revelation that the majority of her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon (which wasn't approved by Hepburn herself) were seen as the main reasons for the snub.\n The ceremony was produced by MGM's Joe Pasternak and hosted, for the 14th time, by Bob Hope. The awards show was a star-studded one, including an appearance by Judy Garland, who sang a medley of Cole Porter songs in tribute to the composer, who had died in October 1964.\n This event marked the first time that more than two films had received ten or more nominations (repeated at the 50th and 92nd Academy Awards), and the only time in Oscar history that three films got twelve or more nominations: Becket and My Fair Lady each received twelve, while Mary Poppins received thirteen.
