It is operated by the state-owned Guangzhou Metro Corporation and was the fourth metro system to be built in mainland China, after those of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.\n The earliest efforts to build an underground rapid transit system in Guangzhou date back to 1960. In the two decades that followed, the project was brought into the agenda five times, but ended up abandoned each time due to financial and technical difficulties. Preparation of what would lead to today's Guangzhou Metro did not start until the 1980s, and it was not until 1993 that construction of the first line, Line\u00a01, officially began. Line\u00a01 opened four years later in 1997 with five stations in operation.\n As of 28\u00a0December\u00a02019[update], Guangzhou Metro has 14 lines in operation, namely Line\u00a01, Line\u00a02, Line\u00a03, Line\u00a04, Line\u00a05, Line\u00a06, Line 7, Line\u00a08, Line 9, Line 13, Line 14, Line 21, Guangfo Line, and Zhujiang New Town APM reaching both the urban core and surrounding suburbs. Guangfo Line connects Guangzhou and Foshan and is the first metro line between two cities in the country. Daily service hours start at 6:00\u00a0am and end at midnight, and daily ridership averages over 7\u00a0million. Having delivered 3.029\u00a0billion rides in 2018 (Guangzhou Metro) is the third busiest metro system in the world, after the metro systems of Beijing and Shanghai. Guangzhou Metro operates 271 stations,[note 1] and 514.8\u00a0km (319.9\u00a0mi) of lines.\n \nExtensive development of the metro network has been planned for the decade of 2011\u20132020.

Total operational capacity is scheduled to exceed 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) by 2020. The Guangzhou Metro is actively constructing connections to neighboring cities. Foshan is already connected via the Guangfo Metro with connections via Line 7 and Foshan Metro Line 2 under construction. Dongguan city is proposing connections with Guangzhou Metro Line 13 and the Dongguan Metro. Neighboring Huizhou city proposed in 2016 that Guangzhou Metro Line 16 be extended into Longmen County, achieving the integration of Huizhou and Guangzhou. In January 2018, Huizhou's mayor Mai Jiaomeng revealed that Huizhou was studying two connections with the Guangzhou Metro with Line 16 heading to Yonghan Town, Longmen County and Line 21 extended to Mount Luofu in Boluo County.

  "/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)": "The Mass Rapid Transit, abbreviated and referred to in local parlance as the MRT, is a heavy rail rapid transit system that constitutes the bulk of the railway network in Singapore, spanning\u2014with the exception of the forested core and the island's rural northwest\u2014the length and width of the city-state's main island.[note 1] The first section of the MRT opened on 7 November 1987, and the network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country's public transportation system, with an average daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019,[note 2] approximately 83% of the bus network's 4.099 million in the same period.\n Singapore's MRT infrastructure is built, operated, and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority, a statutory board of the Government of Singapore. The Land Transport Authority allocates operating concessions to two for-profit private corporations, namely SMRT and SBS Transit, both of which are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines. These operators also run bus and taxi services, thus facilitating the full integration of public transport services. \n As of January 2020, the MRT network encompasses 203 kilometres (126\u00a0mi) of route on standard gauge, with 122 stations in operation, spread across six lines set in a circle-radial topology. The network is expected to double to a total length of almost 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi) by 2040 as a result of ongoing expansion works to its six existing lines and the construction of three new lines. The network is complemented by a small number of local Light Rail Transit (LRT) networks in the suburban towns of Bukit Panjang, Sengkang, and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates, bringing the combined length of the domestic heavy and light rail network to 231.6 kilometres (143.9\u00a0mi), with a total of 159 stations in operation.[note 3]  \n The MRT is the oldest, busiest, and most comprehensive rapid transit system (both by length and number of stations) in Southeast Asia.[note 4] More than S$85 billion (US$63 billion) has been spent on the construction of all currently operational lines in the network, the procurement of rolling stock and other rail assets, and the periodical renewal of assets, making the MRT one of the costliest rapid transit networks and public transportation projects in the world on both a per-kilometre and absolute basis.[note 5]  The system has the added distinctions of having the longest fully automated and driverless network in the world, as well as some of the longest and deepest subway tunnel sections in the world. The MRT is also unique in that the vast majority of underground stations in the network double as purpose-built Singapore Civil Defence Force bunkers and air raid shelters, being built with hardened boundary walls, reinforced concrete floor and roof slabs, and concrete or steel doors for the purpose of withstanding conventional aerial bomb and chemical attacks.",

Its growth between 1995 and 2007 put it among the fastest growing networks in the world at the time, rivaling many Asian metros such as the Shanghai Metro, Guangzhou Metro, Beijing Subway, and Delhi Metro. However, the European debt crisis greatly slowed expansion plans, with many projects being postponed and canceled.

  "/wiki/Toei_Oedo_Line": "The \u014cedo Line is the first Tokyo subway line to use linear motor propulsion (and the second in Japan after the Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line), which allows it to use smaller cars and smaller tunnels (a benefit similarly achieved by the Advanced Rapid Transit system manufactured by Bombardier). This technology, though, is incompatible with other railway and subway lines, which can only operate with vehicles utilizing conventional rotary motors, thus preventing \u014cedo Line trains from operating through services onto them. Although vehicles with rotary motor propulsion can technically operate on the \u014cedo Line, its smaller tunnels and loading gauge prevents such occurrences, hence making the \u014cedo Line the first self-enclosed subway line in Tokyo in over 40 years, and the first such line operated by Toei.\n The line is deep (as low as 48 meters below ground at points) through central Tokyo, including three underground crossings of the Sumida River. Originally budgeted at \u00a5682.6 billion and 6 years, the construction ended up taking nearly 10 years and estimates of the final cost of construction range from the official \u00a5988.6 billion to over \u00a51,400 billion yen, making it the most expensive subway line ever built. (Yokohama's Minato Mirai Line, however, was even costlier if measured per kilometer.)\n Ridership projections originally estimated 1 million users daily, a figure scaled down to 820,000 before opening. At the end of 2006, the line was averaging 720,000 passengers/day. However, its ridership has increased by about five percent each year since its opening, following new commercial and residential development around major stations such as Roppongi and Shiodome.  According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the \u014cedo Line was the fourth most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 178% capacity between Monzen-Nakach\u014d and Tsukishima stations.\n There are plans to extend the \u014cedo Line westward from its current western terminus at Hikarigaoka Station through to a new terminus in \u014cizumigakuench\u014d, 1.5\u00a0km north of \u014cizumi-gakuen Station (on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line) then later towards Higashi-Tokorozawa Station (on the Musashino Line). Construction of the first segment to \u014cizumigakuench\u014d is tentatively scheduled for before 2015, and will include the construction of three new stations, temporarily named Doshida station, \u014cizumich\u014d station and \u014cizumigakuench\u014d station.
