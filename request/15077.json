  "/wiki/Travel_Man": "Travel Man is a British television travel documentary series. It features presenter Richard Ayoade, travelling to a popular city each episode with a celebrity guest. It was produced around the same time Ayoade was presenting Gadget Man. The style of the show is very fast paced, with bracing editing and a very dry sense of humour, led by Ayoade's fourth-wall-breaking voice over (he may refer to the fact that the voice over doesn't do the city justice, that there's just no time to describe it properly or that the cutaway shots were rather generic etc). There's often a use of comical library music. Unlike Top Gear which evolved from a consumer advice show on cars into pure entertainment, Travel Man entertains and remains useful to viewers planning a trip. Onscreen pop-ups highlight various activities or places to visit and their cost, and the overall price of staying 48 hours in that week's city is always mentioned at the end of each episode. Ayoade's presentation style and banter with that week's guest often emphasises his social inadequacies.",
