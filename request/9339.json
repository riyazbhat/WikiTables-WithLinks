  "/wiki/Max_Stewart": "Malcolm Clarke Stewart (14 March 1935  \u2013 19 March 1977) was an Australian racing driver. He was known as the \"Jolly Green Giant\" for his disposition and height.\n Stewart was born in Orange, New South Wales. He began his motorsport career racing motorcycles, being selected to represent Australia at the 1955 Isle of Man TT, but withdrew due to work commitments. After racing Karts and touring cars he moved to open wheelers in 1965 with much success, winning the 1967 and 1968 Australian One and a Half Litre Championships. Stewart was selected to drive for Alec Mildren Racing, and went on to win the 1969 and 1970 Australian Formula 2 Championships driving a 1.6 litre Mildren Waggott. In 1970 he competed in a 2-litre Mildren Waggott in which he ran strongly in the 1970 Tasman Series with a number of podiums, and finished second to Jackie Stewart in the 1970 JAF Grand Prix for Formula Libre cars. He also won the 1971 Australian Drivers' Championship and the 1972 Singapore Grand Prix.\n Stewart later raced a Lola T330, winning the 1974 Australian Drivers' Championship  and the 1974 Australian Grand Prix. He then developed an initially troublesome Lola T400, winning the 1975 Australian Grand Prix and  the 1975 Toby Lee Series. He led the 1976 Australian Grand Prix from Vern Schuppan and John Goss until he retired a few laps from the end.\n Max Stewart lost his life on 19 March 1977 in an accident while practicing at Calder Park Raceway, Victoria.",
  "/wiki/Lola_Cars": "Lola Cars International Ltd. was a British race car engineering company in operation from 1958 to 2012. The company was founded by Eric Broadley in Huntingdon, England, and endured for more than fifty years to become one of the oldest and largest manufacturers of racing cars in the world. Lola Cars started by building small front-engined sports cars, and branched out into Formula Junior cars before diversifying into a wider range of sporting vehicles.  Lola was acquired by Martin Birrane in 1998 after the unsuccessful MasterCard Lola attempt at Formula One.\n Lola Cars was a brand of the Lola Group, which combined former rowing boat manufacturer Lola Aylings and Lola Composites, that specialized in carbon fibre production. After a period in bankruptcy administration, Lola Cars International ceased trading on 5 October 2012. Many of Lola's assets were subsequently purchased by a partnership composed of Multimatic Engineering and the Carl A. Haas Automotive company.",
  "/wiki/Chevrolet_Small-Block_engine": "The Chevrolet small-block engine is a series of V8 automobile engines used in normal production by the Chevrolet division of General Motors between 1954 and 2003, using the same basic engine block. Referred to as a \"small-block\" for its comparative size relative to the physically much larger Chevrolet big-block engines, the family spanned from 262 cu in (4.3 L) to 400 cu in (6.6 L) in displacement. Engineer Ed Cole is credited with leading the design for this engine.\n Generation I and Generation II LT engines are distinct from subsequent LS based small-block engines. The Generation II engine is largely an improved version of the Generation I, having many interchangeable parts and dimensions. Later generation engines have only the rod bearings, transmission-to-block bolt pattern and bore spacing in common with the Generation I and II engines.\n Production of the original small-block began in late 1954 for the 1955 model year, with a displacement of 265 cu in (4.3 L), growing over time to 400 cu in (6.6 L) by 1970. Among the intermediate displacements were the 283 cu in (4.6 L), 327 cu in (5.4 L), and numerous 350 cu in (5.7 L) versions. Introduced as a performance engine in 1967, the 350 went on to be employed in both high- and low-output variants across the entire Chevrolet product line.\n Although all of Chevrolet's siblings of the period (Buick, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Holden) designed their own V8s, it was the Chevrolet 305 and 350 cu in (5.0 and 5.7 L) small-block that became the GM corporate standard. Over the years, every American General Motors division except Saturn and Geo used it and its descendants in their vehicles.\n Finally superseded by the Generation III LS in the 1997 and discontinued in 2003, the engine is still made by a GM subsidiary in Mexico as a crate engine for replacement and hot rodding purposes. In all, over 100,000,000 small-blocks have been built in carbureted and fuel injected forms since 1955 as of November 29, 2011. The small-block family line was honored as one of the 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century by automotive magazine Ward's AutoWorld.\n In February 2008 a Wisconsin businessman reported that his 1991 Chevrolet C1500 pickup had logged over 1 million miles without any major repairs to its small block V8 engine.

  "/wiki/V8_engine": "A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration.\n The first known working V8 engine was produced by the French company Antoinette in 1904 for use in aircraft, and the 1914-1935 Cadillac L-Head engine is considered the first automotive V8 engine to be produced in significant quantities. The popularity of V8 engines in cars was greatly increased following the 1932 introduction of the Ford Flathead V8.",

  "/wiki/Graeme_Lawrence": "Graeme Lawrence is a former race car driver from New Zealand. He started serious motor racing in the  National 1.5 litre series (NZ equivalent of F3) winning the series decisively in 1968 ahead of David Oxton and Ken Smith. Lawrence then ran half a European F2 series in an uncompetitive semi works F2 McLaren, he found the racing harder than expected and was shaken, by his experience racing in Germany at the Hockenheim race in the rain, were Jim Clark was killed. McLaren allowed Lawrence to build up another F2 chassis in his works and was 2nd in the NZ Gold Star series in the car, and first NZ driver home in the Tasman races at Pukekohe and Levin.\n Lawrence was the first New Zealander to win a race in the Tasman Series, in 1970. Although he won only the one race that year, he was Tasman Series champion, driving Chris Amon's old Dino 246 Tasmania. He won New Zealand's Gold Star Race Championship for single seaters in the 1970-71 driving the Ferrari, and then ran the full Can Am series in an elderly McLaren sponsored by Canadian interests. Lawrence regularly qualified in mid grid, and suggested he still had international potential. This was confirmed by brilliant driving of the underpowered Dino 2.4 in the 1971 Tasman, at Levin he passed Amon in a March 701, Oxton and Cannon and was closing on 2nd placed Neil Allen, when he collided with a lapped back marker and at Levin he finished third ahead of Amon and Gardiner, but a bad crash in a new Lola F5000 at Pukekohe in 1972, left Lawrence with the Lola limp and largely ended any chance of a racing career in the United States and he did not fully recover till the 1974-75 race season driving a Lola T332 Formula 5000 car. which Lawrence set up largely to the pattern of the US F5000 Parnelli cars of Andretti and Unser. In the 1975 Tasman he was narrowly defeated by Warwick Brown, but for the following two season he lost his Marlboro and Singapore Airline sponsorship and his Lola 332T was less reliable, although in the 1976 NZ international series, he briefly led at Pukekohe and won at Teretonga and in 1977 a devastating drive at Oran Park, from the back of the field took him  4th at  behind Alan Jones, Peter Gethin and Warwick Brown, before  retiring, mid race. In Australasian F5000 races, Lawrence had  driven hard, racing for victory rather than adopting the percentage driving tactics of say a John McCormick, David Oxton or John Walker, inevitably that resulted in more retirements and  crashes.\n He has also won the Formula Pacific Malaysian Grand Prix in 1978 and the Formula Libre Singapore Grand Prix in 1969, 1970 and 1971.  Lawrence competed in the 1970 Can-Am season, driving the Spirit of Edmonton McLaren M12 to points finishes.",

  "/wiki/Brian_Hart_Ltd.": "Brian Hart Ltd., also known as Hart and Hart Racing Engines, was a motor racing engine manufacturer that participated in 157 Formula One Grands Prix, powering a total of 368 entries.\n Founded in 1969 by British engineer Brian Hart, Hart initially concentrated on servicing and tuning engines from other manufacturers for various independent British teams at all levels of motorsport. Hart found particular success with developments of Ford's FVA engine, eventually leading the large multinational company to approach the small independent to develop the Ford BDA 1.6 L engine for the 2.0L class. The European Formula Two title was won in both 1971 and 1972 with Hart-built Ford engines, and the 2.0 L BDA engine powered the majority of Ford's 1970s rallying successes.\n With Ford's withdrawal from F2 in the mid-1970s, Hart began to concentrate on building their own designs. The first engine to bear the Hart name alone was the twin-cam, four-cylinder Hart 420R F2 unit, which appeared in 1976 and powered race-winning cars until the end of the decade. In 1978, the Toleman team agreed to a partnership program, with Toleman providing finance to develop further Hart engine designs. The fruits of this collaboration resulted in Toleman taking a one-two finish in the 1980 European F2 Championship.",
  "/wiki/Inline-four_engine": "The inline-four engine or straight-four engine is a type of inline (straight) internal combustion four-cylinder engine with all four cylinders mounted in a straight line, or plane along the crankcase. The single bank of cylinders may be oriented in either a vertical or an inclined plane with all the pistons driving a common crankshaft. Where it is inclined, it is sometimes called a slant-four. In a specification chart or when an abbreviation is used, an inline-four engine is listed either as I4 or L4 (for longitudinal, to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter I).\n The inline-four layout is in perfect primary balance and confers a degree of mechanical simplicity which makes it popular for economy cars. However, despite its simplicity, it suffers from a secondary imbalance which causes minor vibrations in smaller engines. These vibrations become more powerful as engine size and power increase, so the more powerful engines used in larger cars generally are more complex designs with more than four cylinders.\n Today almost all manufacturers of four-cylinder engines for automobiles produce the inline-four layout, with Subaru and Porsche 718 flat-four engines being notable exceptions, and so four-cylinder is usually synonymous with and a more widely used term than inline-four. The inline-four is the most common engine configuration in modern cars, while the V6 engine is the second most popular. In the late 2000s (decade), due to stringent government regulations mandating reduced vehicle emissions and increased fuel efficiency, the proportion of new vehicles sold in the U.S. with four-cylinder engines (largely of the inline-four type) rose from 30 percent to 47 percent between 2005 and 2008, particularly in mid-size vehicles where a decreasing number of buyers have chosen the V6 performance option.",
