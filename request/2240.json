Located in the inner-city area of Saint-Michel, it was founded in Baie-Saint-Paul on 16 June 1984 by former street performers Guy Lalibert\u00e9 and Gilles Ste-Croix. Originating as a performing troupe called Les \u00c9chassiers ([lez\u203fe.\u0283a.sje], \"The Waders\"), they toured Quebec in various forms between 1979 and 1983. Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to perform as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier's voyage to Canada. Their first official production Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984, and after securing a second year of funding, Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a \"proper circus\". Its theatrical, character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus (\"nouveau cirque\") that it remains today. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created\u2014with the direction of Franco Dragone\u2014which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.
