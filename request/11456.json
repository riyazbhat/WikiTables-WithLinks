  "/wiki/Battle_of_Buffington_Island": "The Battle of Buffington Island, also known as the St. Georges Creek Skirmish, was an American Civil War engagement in Meigs County, Ohio, and Jackson County, West Virginia, on July 19, 1863, during Morgan's Raid. The largest battle in Ohio during the war, Buffington Island contributed to the capture of the famed Confederate cavalry raider, Brig. Gen. John H. Morgan, who was seeking to escape Union army pursuers across the Ohio River at a ford opposite Buffington Island.\n Delayed overnight, Morgan was almost surrounded by Union cavalry the next day, and the resulting battle ended in a Confederate rout, with over half of the 1,700-man Confederate force being captured. General Morgan and some 700 men escaped, but the daring raid finally ended on July 26 with his surrender after the Battle of Salineville. Morgan's Raid was of little military consequence, but it did spread terror among much of the population of southern and eastern Ohio, as well as neighboring Indiana.",

Known to his intimates as \"Major\" Downing, he worked for much of his life as a pilot for riverboats on the Mississippi River.

One of his two sons, John B. Jr., was the house's namesake\n Downing's house in Middleport is a brick building with a foundation of sandstone, an asphalt roof, and elements of wood and various types of metal. Designed by R.A.

  "/wiki/William_H._Grant_House_(Middleport,_Ohio)": "The William H. Grant House is a historic house in Middleport, Ohio, United States. One of the area's earliest concrete houses, it has been designated a historic site. Built in 1852, the house is constructed of concrete on a foundation of sandstone. Two stories tall, the house is rectangular with a small frame addition to the rear, which was built about ten years after the original part of the house. Born in 1820, William H. Grant pioneered concrete architecture in Meigs County: a small experimental house (no longer in existence) was the first concrete building in the county, and the present house, near the experimental building, was the second. Besides serving as a residence, the house is a local religious landmark. Before dying in 1845, Johnny Appleseed visited Middleport and converted the Grants to Swedenborgianism. Several other Middleport residents also joined the new religion, and after building the present house, the Grants used it as a meeting place for their coreligionists.",

The construction dates of some elements of the grounds are unknown, but the present sharply-curved racetrack was finished in 1889 or earlier. In 1890, donations by average citizens paid for the construction of a grandstand by the track to supplement a nearby hillside where fairgoers had previously sat. Instead of being placed simply along one side of the track, the grandstand curves around the northeastern turn of the track; it is the only curved grandstand at an Ohio county fairgrounds.

Middleport was founded as \"Sheffield\" during the 1820s, a time of great prosperity and rapidly increasing commerce in Meigs County. Among its earliest industries was a cotton mill, built despite the lack of cotton production in the vicinity. Local residents formed the village's first public library in 1908, but its initial location on the second floor of a commercial building soon proved unsatisfactory. One year later, the library's board contacted Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Corporation in order to begin participating in its library construction program.

  "/wiki/Mound_Cemetery_Mound_(Chester,_Ohio)": "The Mound Cemetery Mound is a Native American mound in central Meigs County, Ohio, United States. Located in the eponymous Mound Cemetery, the mound lies north of the community of Chester in Chester Township. Because the mound has never been excavated, it remains in fine condition. Its location near the Middle Branch of the Shade River suggests that it was built by the Adena people; if so, it can be expected to contain remnants of a wooden structure that served as the burial place for a prominent member of Adena society. Many burial mounds existed in present-day Meigs County when the area was first settled, but many succumbed to the shovels of curious settlers who hoped to find treasures within. Some of these mounds yielded artifacts such as stone tools, pottery, and skeletons when opened. Other mounds were gradually destroyed by the plows of farmers cultivating their fields for many years. The remains of what may have once been another mound and related earthworks can be found in the near vicinity of Mound Cemetery.",

Among these points is one of the distinctive form known as a \"bird point\".\n It appears that the Adena used the mound and its surrounding area for hundreds of years; some of the points are typical of the early years of the Adena culture, which dates from circa 1000 BC, while others appear to date from the culture's late period, circa 400 AD.\n In recognition of its archaeological value, the Reeves Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
