It is the largest city in terms of population and land area in Metro Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Quezon City is not located in and should not be confused with Quezon Province, which was also named after the president. Quezon City hosts a number of government offices, the most important of which are the Batasang Pambansa Complex (the seat of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the Philippine Congress), and the Quezon City Reception House (the current seat of the Vice President of the Philippines). Quezon City also serves as home to the University of the Philippines Diliman - the national university - and Ateneo de Manila University. Also located in Quezon City is the Quezon Memorial Circle, a national park. The park is an ellipse bounded by Elliptical Road. Its main feature is the Quezon Memorial Shrine, a 66-meter-tall mausoleum containing the remains of President Quezon and his wife, First Lady Aurora Quezon.

The Spanish city of Manila was founded on June 24, 1571, by Spanish conquistador Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi. The date is regarded as the city's official founding date; however, a settlement has already existed dating back as far as 1258.
