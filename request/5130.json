  "/wiki/Chudang_Palii_Japanese_World_War_II_Defensive_Complex": "The Chudang Palii Japanese World War II Defensive Complex is one of the largest surviving World War II defensive establishments in the Northern Mariana Islands.  Located at the base of a limestone bluff overlooking the island's airport, it consists of an extensive series of tunnels, walls, enclosures, gun emplacements and other features.  These were built in 1944 and 1945, probably with forced labor, after the Japanese decided to embark on a program of in-depth island defenses after Allied successes against defenses that were limited to shore-based establishments.  These works are characterized by an extensive use of native materials (due to a general inability to bring in outside supplies at that period in the war), and by the use of manual labor to dig tunnels, trenches, and other features.\n The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.",

  "/wiki/Commissioner's_Office_(Rota)": "The Commissioner's Office is a rare surviving example of transitional Spanish-Japanese architecture on the island of Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands, an insular area of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean.  It is a single-story structure with walls of manposteria (coral, typically mixed with limestone mortar, but in this case probably portland cement), a construction method adopted during the Spanish period.  The window trim consists of ifil lintels, and the building's cornice is Japanese in style.  At the time of the building's listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, it was in deteriorated condition, lacking a roof and with one collapsed wall.  The structure was built in the 1930s by the local Chamorro people, who had been displaced to that part of the island by Japanese settlement undertaken as part of the South Pacific Mandate.  The building housed the offices of a local commissioner, or village head responsible to the Japanese authorities.  Many buildings built by the Japanese during the mandate period were destroyed in World War II.",
