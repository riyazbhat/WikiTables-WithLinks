  "/wiki/Coppa_d'_Oro_delle_Dolomiti": "The Coppa d' Oro delle Dolomiti (translation: Gold Cup of the Dolomites) was a car race on public roads open to traffic, which was run in the Dolomite Mountains of northern Italy for ten years from 1947 to 1956. It took place along an anti-clockwise circuit that was 304 km (188 miles) long and usually took about 3 to 4 hours to complete the one lap that made up the race distance, with the start and finish in the town of Cortina d'Ampezzo. The circuit went through many Italian towns, and it had nearly 2,000 meters (2\u00a0km, 1.25 miles, or 6,600 feet) of elevation change- more than 6 1/2 times that of the N\u00fcrburgring and the Isle of Man TT track. It was established by the Automobile Club of Belluno, which is still the runner of the now historic event, since 1972. The race is included in the international calendar FIA as \"Big Event CSAI\" classic regularity.\n The official name of the race has changed over the years. In 1947, it was known as the \"Cup of the Dolomites\", from 1948 to 1950 it was known as the \"International Cup of the Dolomites\", and in 1951 it was renamed the \"Gold Cup of the Dolomites\".",
  "/wiki/Mille_Miglia": "The Mille Miglia (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8mille \u02c8mi\u028e\u028ea], Thousand Miles) was an open-road, motorsport endurance race established in 1927 by the young Counts Francesco Mazzotti and Aymo Maggi, which took place in Italy twenty-four times from 1927 to 1957 (thirteen before the war, eleven from 1947).\n Like the older Targa Florio and later the Carrera Panamericana, the MM made grand tourers like Alfa Romeo, BMW, Ferrari, Maserati, Mercedes Benz and Porsche famous. The race brought out an estimated five million spectators.\n From 1953 until 1957, the Mille Miglia was also a round of the World Sports Car Championship.\n Since 1977, the \"Mille Miglia\" has been reborn as a regularity race for classic and vintage cars. Participation is limited to cars, produced no later than 1957, which had attended (or were registered to) the original race. The route (Brescia\u2013Rome round trip) is similar to that of the original race, maintaining the point of departure/arrival in Viale Venezia in Brescia.",
