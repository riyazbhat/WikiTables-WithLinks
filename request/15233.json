About 3 million people live in the Lisbon metropolitan area, which represents approximately 27% of the country's population. It is mainland Europe's westernmost capital city and the only one along the Atlantic coast. Lisbon lies in the western Iberian Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean and the River Tagus. The westernmost portions of its metro area form the westernmost point of Continental Europe, which is known as Cabo da Roca, located in the Sintra Mountains.\n Lisbon is recognised as an alpha-level global city because of its importance in finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education and tourism. Lisbon is one of two Portuguese cities (alongside Porto) to be recognised as a global city.

It is an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the Macaronesia region of the North Atlantic Ocean, about 1,360\u00a0km (850\u00a0mi) west of continental Portugal, about 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) west of Lisbon, in continental Portugal, about 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) northwest of Morocco, and about 2,500\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) southeast of Newfoundland, Canada.\n Its main industries are agriculture, dairy farming, livestock, fishing, and tourism, which is becoming the major service activity in the region.
