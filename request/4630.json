The city, with its adjoining conurbation, is the most populous in Nigeria and South of The Sahara, Africa.  It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and one of the most populous urban areas. Lagos is a major financial centre in Africa; the megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent.\n Lagos initially emerged as a port city that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.\n Lagos, the capital of Nigeria since its amalgamation in 1914, went on to become the capital of Lagos State after its creation. However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present day Lagos, also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\", and officially as \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 20 LGAs, 37 LCDAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State's total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.\n The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million.[note 3] As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.",

  "/wiki/Newspapers_published_in_Nigeria": "Newspapers published in Nigeria have a strong tradition of the principle of \"publish and be damned\" that dates  back to the colonial era when founding fathers of the Nigerian press such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, Ernest Ikoli, Obafemi Awolowo and Lateef Jakande used their papers to fight for independence.\n Until the 1990s most publications were government-owned, but private papers such as the Daily Trust, Nigerian Tribune, The Punch, Vanguard, and the Guardian continued to expose public and private scandals despite government attempts at suppression.\n Laws related to the media, including newspapers, are scattered across various pieces of legislation. There are few good sources of discussion and analysis of these laws.\n Newspaper reporters are often poorly paid[according to whom?] and newspapers depend heavily on advertisements that may be placed by companies owned by powerful people. In some cases, this makes the papers cautious in reporting details of crimes or suspected crimes, and sometimes they carry articles that paint clearly corrupt individuals in a favourable light.\nAn analysis of newspapers shows a strong bias towards coverage of males, reflecting prevalent cultural biases. Few articles discuss women and there are few photographs of women outside the fashion sections.\nAlthough earnings have declined since the late 1980s the number of publications has steadily grown.\n As of 2008 there were over 100 national, regional or local newspapers.\n Online newspapers have become popular since the rise of Internet accessibility in Nigeria; more than ten percent of the top fifty websites in the country are devoted to online newspapers. Due to improved mobile penetration and the growth of smartphones, Nigerians have begun to rely on the internet for news. Online newspapers have also been able to bypass government restrictions because content can be shared without the need for any physical infrastructure. The result has been a disruption of the traditional sources of news which have dominated the media industry. Recent online newspapers include Sahara Reporters, Ripples Nigeria and Premium Times.\n Among all the newspapers published and circulated in Nigeria, National Light, which is owned by the Anambra State is the longest-thriving state-owned newspaper in the country, having spanned consistently for twenty-eight years. National Light is one of the newspapers published by the Anambra Newspapers And Printing Corporation (ANPC), which has its headquarters in Awka, the state's capital. Other newspapers published by the corporation are Ka \u1ecc D\u1ecb Taa (which is currently the only Igbo Language newspaper in the country) and the Sportslight Xtra (a sports Newspaper). Ka \u1ecc D\u1ecb Taa and Sportslight Xtra debuted in 2017 and 2019 respectively, and were introduced by the corporation's current MD/Editor-in-Chief, Sir Chuka Nnabuife.\n Most modern online newspapers have focused on political news reporting, with very few focused on other topics including business news. The entertainment industry has been dominated by blogs and gossip websites which do not usually identify as newspapers."
