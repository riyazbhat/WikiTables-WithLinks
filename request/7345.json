  "/wiki/Dharani": "A dharani (Devanagari: \u0927\u093e\u0930\u0923\u0940, IAST: dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b) is a Buddhist chant, mnemonic code, incantation, or recitation, usually a mantra consisting of Sanskrit or Pali phrases. Believed to be protective and with powers to generate merit for the Buddhist devotee, they constitute a major part of historic Buddhist literature. These chants have roots in Vedic Sanskrit literature, and many are written in Sanskrit scripts such as the Siddham as well as transliterated into Chinese, Korean, Japanese and other regional scripts.\n Dharani are found in the ancient texts of all major traditions of Buddhism. They are a major part of the Pali canon preserved by the Theravada tradition. Mahayana sutras \u2013 such as the Lotus Sutra and the Heart Sutra \u2013 include or conclude with dharani. Some Buddhist texts, such as Pancaraksa found in the homes of many Buddhist tantra tradition followers, are entirely dedicated to dharani. They are a part of their ritual prayers as well as considered to be an amulet and charm in themselves, whose recitation believed to allay bad luck, diseases or other calamity. They were an essential part of the monastic training in Buddhism's history in East Asia. In some Buddhist regions, they served as texts upon which the Buddhist witness would swear to tell the truth.\n The dharani-genre of literature became popular in East Asia in the 1st millennium CE, with Chinese records suggesting their profusion by the early centuries of the common era. These migrated from China to Korea and Japan. The demand for printed dharani among the Buddhist lay devotees may have led to the development of textual printing innovations. The dharani records of East Asia are the oldest known \"authenticated printed texts in the world\", state Robert Sewell and other scholars. The early-8th-century dharani texts discovered in the Pulguksa temple of Gyeongju, Korea are considered as the oldest known printed texts in the world.[note 1]\n Dharani recitation for the purposes of healing and protection is referred to as Paritta in some Buddhist regions, particularly in Theravada communities. The dharani-genre ideas also inspired the Japanese Koshiki texts, and chanting practices called Daimoku, Nenbutsu (Japan), Nianfo (China) or Yombul (Korea). They are a significant part of the historic Chinese dazangjing (scriptures of the great repository) and the Korean daejanggyeong \u2013 the East Asian compilations of the Buddhist canon between the 5th and 10th centuries.",
  "/wiki/Saamy": "Saamy is a 2003 Indian Tamil-language action film written and directed by Hari. The film was presented by K. Balachander and produced by Pushpa Kandasamy under banner Kavithalayaa Productions. The film stars Vikram and Trisha in lead roles and Kota Srinivasa Rao (debut in Tamil cinema) in a negative role.

  "/wiki/Hari": "Hari or Har(i) (Sanskrit: \u0939\u0930\u093f, Punjabi: \u0a39\u0a30\u0a3f, IAST: Har\u012b or Har) is a name for the supreme absolute in the Vedas, Guru Granth Sahib and many other sacred texts of South Asia. Hari refers to God who takes away all the sorrows of his devotees. In the Rigveda\u2019s Purusha Suktam (Praise of the supreme cosmic Being), Hari is the first and most important name of God ( whose Sanskrit cognate is Brahman), an alternative name of the supreme Being is Narayana after Hari and Purusha according to Narayana Suktam of  theYajurveda. Within the Hindu tradition, it is often used interchangeably with Vishnu to such an extent that they are considered to be one and the same. In the Vedas, it is required to use the mantra \"Harih om\" before any recitation, just to declare that every ritual we perform is an offering to that supreme Divine Being; even if the hymn praises some one or the other demigods. The idea of demigods as found in Hinduism is very different from that found within Greco-Roman mythology. This has to be borne in mind while understanding how, within Hinduism, all beings including demigods are inseparable from Hari. The phrase \"Harih Om\" gestures towards Advaita Vedanta and other categories of non-dual thinking. \"Harih Om\" is akin to saying that all creation that we can see is in fact, a mirroring of the One Self. This is not the concept of mimesis as found in Western philosophy. \n In Hinduism, kirtan or praise songs of any demigod has a common name known as Hari kirtan and katha and, storytelling (oral narratives of a religious nature) is known as Hari katha.\n No depiction of Hari (God) is permitted in Sikhism. Hari in Purusha Suktam, Narayana Suktam and Rudra Suktam is usually depicted as having a form with countless heads, limbs and arms (a way of saying that the Supreme Being is  everywhere and cannot be limited by conditional aspects of time and space). Lord Hari is also called sharangapani as he also wields a bow named as sharanga.\n The word \"Hari\" is widely used in Sanskrit and Prakrit literature as well as in Hindu, Sikhism, Buddhist and Jain religions. The name \"Hari\" also appears as the 656th name of Vishnu in the Vishnu sahasranama of the Mahabharata and is considered to be of great significance in Vaishnavism.",
  "/wiki/Gemini_(2002_Tamil_film)": "Gemini is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language action film written and directed by Saran and produced by AVM Productions.
