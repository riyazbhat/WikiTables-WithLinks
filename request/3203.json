  "/wiki/Alice_Springs_Reptile_Centre": "The Alice Springs Reptile Centre is a privately operated reptile centre and environmental education facility in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. It contains the largest collection of reptiles in the Northern Territory. Animals at the centre include the Perentie Goanna, Frill-necked Lizards, Thorny Devils, large and small pythons and venomous snakes including Inland Taipans, Brown Snakes, Death Adders and Mulga Snakes. The centre is a popular tourist destination, particularly for children.\n The centre is devoted to indigenous reptiles. Many are collected from local properties or from areas about to be burned under the controlled burning program to keep bushfires from threatening local homes. Most of the reptiles end up being relocated to uninhabited areas. The Alice Springs Reptile Centre also doubles as a snake call centre, with the owner and staff going out to homes to remove venomous snakes from places where they might inconvenience people.",
  "/wiki/Alice_Springs": "Alice Springs (Eastern Arrernte: Mparntwe) is the third-largest town in the Northern Territory of Australia.

Now colloquially known as The Alice or simply Alice, the town is situated roughly in Australia's geographic centre. It is nearly equidistant from Adelaide and Darwin.\n The area is known as Mparntwe to its original inhabitants, the Arrernte, who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around what is now Alice Springs for tens of thousands of years. \n Alice Springs had an urban population of 26,534 in June 2018, having reduced at an average annual rate of -1.16% year-on-year over the preceding five years. The city's population accounts for approximately 10% of the population of the Northern Territory.\n The town straddles the usually dry Todd River on the northern side of the MacDonnell Ranges.

  "/wiki/Moreton_Bay": "The Moreton Bay is a bay located on the eastern coast of Australia 14 kilometres (8.7\u00a0mi) from central Brisbane, Queensland. It is one of Queensland's most important coastal resources. The waters of Moreton Bay are a popular destination for recreational anglers and are used by commercial operators who provide seafood to market.\n The Port of Brisbane coordinates large traffic along the shipping channel which crosses the northern section of the bay. The bay serves as a safe approach to the airport and reduces noise pollution over the city to the west of the runway. A number of barge, ferry and water-taxi services also travel over the bay.\n Moreton Bay was the site of conflict between the indigenous Quandamooka people and early European settlers. It contains environmentally significant habitats and large areas of sandbanks. The bay is the only place in Australia where dugong gather into herds. Many parts of the mainland foreshore and southern islands are settled.\n Moreton Bay is described as lagoonal because of the existence of a series of off-shore barrier islands that restrict the flow of oceanic water. The tidal range is moderate at 1.5\u20132 metres (4\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in\u20136\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in range. Moreton Bay has an average depth of 6.8 metres (22\u00a0ft). This shallow depth lets light filter through to the seafloor, allowing an array of marine plants to grow which support a diverse range of fauna. The bay itself covers 1,523 square kilometres (588\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has a catchment area 14 times larger, covering 21,220 square kilometres (8,190\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The waters of the bay are mostly blue in colour. Western parts of the bay are sometimes tinted green from algae, brown from suspended sediments or yellow-brown from humic runoff.\n In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Moreton Bay was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \"Natural attraction\".",
