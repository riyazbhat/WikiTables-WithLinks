Held from 31 May to 21 June in Mexico, it was the first World Cup tournament staged in North America, and the first held outside Europe and South America. Teams representing 75 nations from all six populated continents entered the competition, and its qualification rounds began in May 1968. Fourteen teams qualified from this process to join host nation Mexico and defending champions England in the 16-team final tournament. El Salvador, Israel and Morocco made their first appearances at the final stage.\n The tournament was won by Brazil, which defeated another two-time former champion, Italy, 4\u20131 in the final in Mexico City. The win gave Brazil its third World Cup title, which allowed them to permanently keep the Jules Rimet Trophy, and a new trophy was introduced in 1974. The victorious team, led by Carlos Alberto and featuring players such as Pel\u00e9, G\u00e9rson, Jairzinho, Rivellino, and Tost\u00e3o, is often cited as the greatest-ever World Cup team. They achieved a perfect record of wins in all six games in the finals, as well as winning all their qualifying fixtures.\nEngland were the defending champions who were knocked out of the tournament following a 2\u20133 loss to West Germany in the quarter final.\n Despite the issues of altitude and high temperature, the finals largely produced attacking football which created an average goals per game record not since bettered by any subsequent World Cup Finals. With the advancements in satellite communications, the 1970 Finals attracted a new record television audience for the FIFA World Cup as games were broadcast live around the world and, in a few cases, in colour - the first time that this was the case. Contrary to popular belief, while a small number of viewers worldwide did watch the tournament on colour television and colour footage and photos have since widely been circulated in popular representations of the tournament, the majority of those who watched the tournament did so in black-and-white.",
