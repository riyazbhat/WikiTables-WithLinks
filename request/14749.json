  "/wiki/Bulk_freighter": "A bulk carrier, bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, steel coils and cement, in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852, economic forces have led to continued development of these ships, resulting in increased size and sophistication. Today's bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability. Today, bulk carriers make up 21% of the world's merchant fleets and range in size from single-hold mini-bulk carriers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000 metric tons of deadweight (DWT). A number of specialized designs exist: some can unload their own cargo, some depend on port facilities for unloading, and some even package the cargo as it is loaded. Over half of all bulk carriers have Greek, Japanese, or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama. South Korea is the largest single builder of bulk carriers, and 82% of these ships were built in Asia. On bulk carriers, crew are involved in operation management and maintenance of the vessel taking care of safety, navigation, maintenance and cargo care, in accordance with international maritime legislation. Cargo loading operations vary in complexity and loading and discharging of cargo can take several days. Bulk carriers can be gearless (dependent upon terminal equipment) or geared (having cranes integral to the vessel). Crews can range in size from three people on the smallest ships to over 30 on the largest. Bulk cargo can be very dense, corrosive, or abrasive.",
  "/wiki/Consort_(nautical)": "Consort is a nautical term for unpowered Great Lakes vessels, usually a fully loaded schooner barge or steamer barge, towed by a larger steamer that would often tow more than one barge. The consort system was used in the Great Lakes from the 1860s to around 1920. Mariner and historian Mark Thompson wrote that the unpowered barges were uninspected vessels not regulated by the marine safety laws. He reported that between 1870 and 1940, the dangerous practice of towing unpowered vessels resulted in many of the most serious groundings when they broke loose or were cut loose during storms. Consort is also used as the term for any ship sailing alongside another, particularly as an escort or ship's tender. Pirates who sailed in small fleets were often described as sailing in consort to one another, that is, one ship following or escorting another to whom it was allied; for example; Thomas Howard's Prosperous and John Bowen's Speedy Return:",
  "/wiki/Iron_ore": "Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe2O3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)\u00b7n(H2O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO3, 48.2% Fe). Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite (greater than about 60% iron) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces. Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel - 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel. Indeed, it has been argued that iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity, except perhaps oil.",

  "/wiki/Grand_Marais,_Minnesota": "Grand Marais (/\u02cc\u0261r\u00e6nd m\u0259\u02c8re\u026a/) is a city in Cook County, Minnesota, United States. It is a northern town on the North Shore with a population of 1,351 at the 2010 census. It is also the county seat and sole municipality of Cook County. Prior to inhabitation by French Canadian settlers and prior to Minnesota's statehood, Grand Marais was inhabited by the Anishinaabe indigenous people, the thriving woodland people also known as the Ojibwe. The Ojibwe name for the area is Gichi-biitoobiig, which means great duplicate water, parallel body of water or double body of water (like a bayou), a reference to the two bays which form the large harbor of Lake Superior. The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s, and the French Canadian Voyageurs termed the settled village Grand Marais which is French for Great Marsh, referring to a marsh that, in early fur-trading times, was 20 acres (8.1 ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there. Another small bay on the east, less protected from storms, is separated from the harbor by a slight projecting point and a short beach. Also, Grand Marais also may mean sheltered water area, as the harbor has natural breakwall rock outcroppings, providing for a natural safe harbor for early Lake Superior explorers. Located on the east side of Grand Marais is Chippewa City. Chippewa City thrived in the 1890s, with about 100 families living in the village. The historic Francis Xavier church still stands slightly north of town, just off Highway 61. The church began as a Jesuit mission from Fort William, Ontario in 1855 to minister to the Ojibwe residents of the area.",

Since its founding in 1916, the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings. The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world, reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture. Architects, landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes. Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures, including entrance gateways, hotels and lodges, park roads and bridges, visitor centers, trail shelters, informational kiosks, and even mundane maintenance and support facilities.

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio. The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture. Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style. In form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Therefore, the style defined by symmetry, simple geometry, and social demands instead of ornament. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings.

The area became one of the British Empire's four main fur trading centers in North America, along with Fort Niagara, Fort Detroit, and Michilimackinac. The Grand Portage is an 8.5-mile (13.7 km) (2720 rod) footpath which bypasses a set of waterfalls and rapids on the last 20 miles (32 km) of the Pigeon River before it flows into Lake Superior. This path is part of the historic trade route of the French-Canadian voyageurs and coureur des bois between their wintering grounds and their depots to the east. Composed of the Pigeon River and other strategic interior streams, lakes, and portages, this route was of enormous importance in pre-industrial times. It provided quick water access from Canada's settled areas and Atlantic ports to the fur-rich Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory. Some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from Lake Superior, this trade route crosses the Height of Land Portage, on the Northern continental divide, and connects South Lake in the Pigeon River/Great Lakes watershed with North Lake of the Rainy River watershed.

A path where items are regularly carried between bodies of water is also called a portage. Early French explorers in New France and French Louisiana encountered many rapids and cascades. The Native Americans carried their canoes over land to avoid river obstacles. Over time, important portages were sometimes provided with canals with locks, and even portage railways. Primitive portaging generally involves carrying the vessel and its contents across the portage in multiple trips. Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted over one's shoulders and the center strut may be designed in the style of a yoke to facilitate this. Historically, voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs. Portages can be many kilometers in length, such as the 19-kilometre (12 mi) Methye Portage and the 8.5-mile (13.7 km) Grand Portage (both in North America) often covering hilly or difficult terrain. Some portages involve very little elevation change, such as the very short Mavis Grind in Shetland, which crosses an isthmus.",
  "/wiki/North_American_fur_trade": "The North American fur trade was industry and activity related to the acquisition, trade, exchange, and sale of animal furs in North America. Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of various regions traded among themselves in the pre-Columbian Era. Europeans participated in the trade from the time of their arrival in the New World, extending the trade's reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada during the 17th century, while the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. North American fur trade was at its peak of economic importance in the 19th century, and involved the development of elaborate trade networks. The fur trade became one of the main economic ventures in North America attracting competition among the French, British, Dutch, Spanish, and Russians. Indeed, in the early history of the United States, capitalizing on this trade, and removing the British stranglehold over it, was seen as a major economic objective. Many Native American societies across the continent came to depend on the fur trade as their primary source of income. By the mid-1800s changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices. The American Fur Company and some other companies failed. Many Native communities were plunged into long-term poverty and consequently lost much of the political influence they once had.",

Water north of the divide flows to Hudson Bay; water south of the divide and also south of the St. Lawrence Divide flows to the Gulf of Mexico, otherwise to the Labrador Sea or via the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. From the divide's junction with the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak, just south of the U.S. border in northwestern Montana, it runs north to just across the border then east through southern Alberta and Saskatchewan where it turns southeasterly reentering the U.S. at the northwestern corner of North Dakota. It then continues on to the extreme northeast corner of South Dakota before crossing the middle of Minnesota's western border at the Traverse Gap. The divide then runs north and east through northern Minnesota, through Superior National Forest in the eastern tip, into Ontario. There it passes to the north of Lake Nipigon, then runs as far south as the 48th parallel before veering north again to cross the western border of Quebec just south of Lake Abitibi. It then meanders northeasterly across Quebec to the southwestern boundary of Labrador. From there, it follows the boundary jaggedly north to Killiniq Island where it becomes the boundary between Nunavut and Labrador before reaching its terminus at Cape Chidley on the Labrador Sea. Two triple divide points lie on the divide. One is at its origin on Triple Divide Peak, in Glacier National Park, Montana, where it meets the Continental Divide; this is usually considered the hydrological apex of North America.

The Schroeder Lumber Company from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, established a camp there in 1895, on the Cross River. The loggers had plenty of white pine, balsam fir, and spruce trees to cut. Loggers also dynamited the top 20 feet (6.1 m) of the Cross River waterfall to widen the river and built a series of dams to hold water in reserve. This enabled the loggers to move the logs down the river and into Lake Superior, where they were collected into a holding boom that kept the logs from floating away. The camp operated until 1905, when crews left to log the Apostle Islands. The camp had a reputation for good living conditions, fair wages, and good food. Lumberjacks ate a lot, and if the food wasn't to their liking, they would leave and seek employment with a different company. The sleeping accommodations were spartan, with rows of wooden bunk beds topped with mattresses stuffed with straw, hay, or evergreen boughs, along with pillows stuffed with grain and straw. Author Cathy Wurzer speculates that the smell in the bunkhouse was rather ripe, given the smell of wet woolen clothes being hung up to dry and the housing of sweaty workers living in close quarters. For a time, the Schroeder Lumber Company was one of the largest lumber retailers in the United States. The company owned and operated every step in the lumber supply chain, from cutting down trees to shipping the logs to milling and manufacturing wood products.",
  "/wiki/North_Shore_(Lake_Superior)": "The North Shore of Lake Superior runs from Duluth, Minnesota, United States, at the southwestern end of the lake, to Thunder Bay and Nipigon, Ontario, Canada, in the north to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, in the east. The shore is characterized by alternating rocky cliffs and cobblestone beaches, with forested hills and ridges through which scenic rivers and waterfalls descend as they flow to Lake Superior.",
  "/wiki/Jim_Scott_Fishhouse": "The Jim Scott Fishhouse is a historic building in Grand Marais, Minnesota, United States, built in 1907 by a family-owned commercial fishing outfit. During the fishing season it served as a place to dress and pack fish, while over the winter it was used for the storage and repair of fishing gear. The Jim Scott Fishhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 for having local significance in the theme of commerce. It was nominated for being a representative of the important commercial fishing industry on the upper North Shore of Lake Superior.",
  "/wiki/Commercial_fishing": "Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit, mostly from wild fisheries. It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the earth, but those who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions. Large-scale commercial fishing is also known as industrial fishing. This profession has gained in popularity with the development of shows such as Deadliest Catch, Swords, and Wicked Tuna. The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well. The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit. A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit. It is the adaptability of the fishermen and their methods that cause some concern for fishery managers and researchers; they say that for those reasons, the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of being ruined. Commercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals, ranging from tuna, cod, carp, and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid, and crab, in various fisheries for these species. There are large and important fisheries worldwide for various species of fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and echinoderms. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries of these species are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999."
