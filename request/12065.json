  "/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army": "The Irish Republican Army (IRA; Irish: \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann), also known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA or Provos), was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence, and accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann in Irish. It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland.\n The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement. It was the minority faction in the split, while the majority continued as the Official IRA. The term \"provisional\" was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement. Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970, the name stuck. The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic, nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops. The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 (see timeline). The IRA's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas. It also carried out a bombing campaign in Northern Ireland and England against what it saw as political and economic targets.\n The Provisional IRA called a final ceasefire in July 1997, after its political wing Sinn F\u00e9in was re-admitted into the Northern Ireland peace talks. It supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and in 2005 it disarmed under international supervision. An internal British Army document (released in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act) examining its 37 years of deployment in Northern Ireland, describes the IRA as \"a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force\", while loyalist paramilitaries and other republican groups are described as \"little more than a collection of gangsters\". US media usually described the IRA as \"activists\" and \"guerillas\", while the British press widely dubbed them \"terrorists\". Several splinter groups have been formed as a result of splits within the IRA, including the Continuity IRA which emerged from a split in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994, and the Real IRA after the final 1997 ceasefire, both of which are still active in the low-level dissident Irish republican campaign.\n The IRA's armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of over 1,700 people. The dead included around 1,000 members of the British security forces, and about 640 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275\u2013300 members and an estimated 10,000 imprisoned at various times over the 30-year period.",

The party took its current form in 1970 after another split (with the other faction eventually becoming the Workers' Party of Ireland). It has historically been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Mary Lou McDonald became party president in February 2018.\n Sinn F\u00e9in is one of the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, winning just one seat less than the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election. In that assembly it is the largest Irish nationalist party, and it holds four ministerial posts in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive as of 2020[update]. In the UK House of Commons, Sinn F\u00e9in holds seven of Northern Ireland's 18 seats, making it the second-largest bloc after the DUP; there it follows a policy of abstentionism, refusing to sit in parliament or vote on bills.

It seeks to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a socialist republic encompassing all of Ireland. It is the paramilitary wing of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP).\n The INLA was founded by former members of the Official Irish Republican Army who opposed that group's ceasefire. It was initially known as the \"People's Liberation Army\" or \"People's Republican Army\". The INLA waged a paramilitary campaign against the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland. It was also active to a lesser extent in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. High-profile attacks carried out by the INLA include the Droppin Well bombing, the 1994 Shankill Road killings and the assassinations of Airey Neave in 1979 and Billy Wright in 1997. However, it was smaller and less active than the main republican paramilitary group, the Provisional IRA. It was also weakened by feuds and internal tensions. Members of the group used the covernames People's Liberation Army (PLA), People's Republican Army (PRA) and Catholic Reaction Force (CRF). for attacks its volunteers carried out but the INLA did not want to claim responsibility for. The INLA became a proscribed group in the United Kingdom on 3 July 1979 under the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n After a 24-year armed campaign, the INLA declared a ceasefire on 22 August 1998. In August 1999, it stated that \"There is no political or moral argument to justify a resumption of the campaign\". In October 2009, the INLA formally vowed to pursue its aims through peaceful political means and began decommissioning its weapons.\n The party supports a \"No First Strike\" policy, that is allowing people to see the perceived failure of the peace process for themselves without military actions.\n The INLA is a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000 and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland.",
