  "/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army": "The Irish Republican Army (IRA; Irish: \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann), also known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA or Provos), was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence, and accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann in Irish. It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland. The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement. It was the minority faction in the split, while the majority continued as the Official IRA. The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement. Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970, the name stuck. The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic, nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops. The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 (see timeline). The IRA's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas.",

The original Sinn F\u00e9in organisation was founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith, but has split substantially on a number of occasions since then - notably giving rise to the two traditionally dominant parties of southern Irish politics - Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael - in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War. The party took its current form in 1970 after another split (with the other faction eventually becoming the Workers' Party of Ireland). It has historically been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Mary Lou McDonald became party president in February 2018. Sinn F\u00e9in is one of the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, winning just one seat less than the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election. In that assembly it is the largest Irish nationalist party, and it holds four ministerial posts in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive as of 2020[update]. In the UK House of Commons, Sinn F\u00e9in holds seven of Northern Ireland's 18 seats, making it the second-largest bloc after the DUP; there it follows a policy of abstentionism, refusing to sit in parliament or vote on bills. In the Oireachtas (the parliament of the Republic of Ireland), Sinn F\u00e9in won the largest share of first-preference votes at the 2020 Irish general election.",
