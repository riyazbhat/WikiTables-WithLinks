With more than 46 million inhabitants in 2019, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous Brazilian state, the most populous national subdivision in the Americas, and the third most populous political unit of South America, surpassed only by the rest of the Brazilian Federation and Colombia. The local population is one of the most diverse in the country and descended mostly from Italians, who began immigrating to the country in the late 19th century; of the Portuguese, who colonized Brazil and installed the first European settlements in the region; indigenous peoples, many distinct ethnic groups; Africans, who were brought from Africa as slaves in the colonial era and migrants from other regions of the country.",
  "/wiki/Alpha_Crucis": "Acrux /\u02c8e\u026akr\u028cks/, designated \u03b1 Crucis (Latinised to Alpha Crucis, abbreviated Alpha Cru, \u03b1 Cru) is a multiple star system 321 light-years from the Sun in the constellation of Crux and part of the asterism known as the Southern Cross. With a combined visual magnitude of +0.76, it is the brightest object in Crux and the 13th brightest star in the night sky. It is the southernmost first-magnitude star, 2.3 degrees more southerly than Alpha Centauri. To the naked eye Acrux appears as a single star, but it is actually a multiple star system containing six components. Through optical telescopes, Acrux appears as a triple star, whose two brightest components are visually separated by about 4 arcseconds and are known as Acrux A and Acrux B, \u03b11 Crucis and \u03b12 Crucis, or \u03b1 Crucis A and \u03b1 Crucis B. Both components are B-type stars, and are many times more massive and luminous than the Sun. \u03b11 Crucis is itself a spectroscopic binary with components designated \u03b1 Crucis Aa (officially named Acrux, historically the name of the entire system) and \u03b1 Crucis Ab. Its two component stars orbit every 76 days at a separation of about 1 astronomical unit (AU).",

It has the second largest economy of Brazil, with the largest being that of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The state of Rio de Janeiro is located within the Brazilian geopolitical region classified as the Southeast (assigned by IBGE). Rio de Janeiro shares borders with all the other states in the same Southeast macroregion: Minas Gerais (N and NW), Esp\u00edrito Santo (NE) and S\u00e3o Paulo (SW). It is bounded on the east and south by the South Atlantic Ocean. Rio de Janeiro has an area of 43,653 km2 (16,855 sq mi). Its capital is the city of Rio de Janeiro, which was the capital of the Portuguese Colony of Brazil from 1763 to 1815, of the following United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves from 1815 to 1822, and of later independent Brazil as a kingdom and republic from 1822 to 1960. The state's 22 largest cities are Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, Duque de Caxias, Nova Igua\u00e7u, Niter\u00f3i, Campos dos Goytacazes, Belford Roxo, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti, Petr\u00f3polis, Volta Redonda, Mag\u00e9, Maca\u00e9, Itabora\u00ed, Cabo Frio, Arma\u00e7\u00e3o dos B\u00fazios, Angra dos Reis, Nova Friburgo, Barra Mansa, Barra do Pira\u00ed, Teres\u00f3polis, Mesquita and Nil\u00f3polis.",

A line from the two \"Pointers\", Alpha Centauri through Beta Centauri, leads to within 1\u00b0 north of this star. Distance has been determined using parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, yielding 88.6 light-years (27.2 parsecs) from the Sun.",
  "/wiki/Flag_of_Brazil": "The flag of Brazil (Portuguese: Bandeira do Brasil), known in Portuguese as Verde e amarela (\"The Green and Yellow\"), or less usually Auriverde (\"The Gold-Green\"), is a blue disc depicting a starry sky (which includes the Southern Cross) spanned by a curved band inscribed with the national motto \"Ordem e Progresso\" (\"Order and Progress\"), within a yellow rhombus, on a green field. Brazil officially adopted this design for its national flag on November 19, 1889 \u2014 four days after the Proclamation of the Republic, to replace the flag of the Empire of Brazil. The concept was the work of Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, with the collaboration of Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis and D\u00e9cio Villares. The green field and the yellow parallelogram  from the previous imperial flag, though slightly modified in hue and shape, were preserved \u2014 the green represented the House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil, while the yellow represented the House of Habsburg of his wife, Empress Maria Leopoldina. A blue circle with white five-pointed stars replaced the arms of the Empire of Brazil \u2014 its position in the flag reflects the sky over the city of Rio de Janeiro on November 15, 1889. The humanist motto Ordem e Progresso is derived from Auguste Comte's motto of positivism: \"L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progr\u00e8s pour but\" (\"Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal\"). Each star corresponds to a Brazilian Federative Unit and, according to Brazilian Law, the flag must be updated in case of creation or extinction of a state. At the time the flag was first adopted in 1889, it held 21 stars."
