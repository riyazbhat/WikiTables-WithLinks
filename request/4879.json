They were previously commonly referred to as the Land Wars or the M\u0101ori Wars while M\u0101ori language names for the conflicts included Ng\u0101 pakanga o Aotearoa (\"the great New Zealand wars\") and Te riri P\u0101keh\u0101 (\"the white man's anger\"). Historian James Belich popularised the name \"New Zealand Wars\" in the 1980s, although the term was first used by historian James Cowan in the 1920s. Though the wars were initially localised conflicts triggered by tensions over disputed land purchases, they escalated dramatically from 1860 as the government became convinced it was facing united M\u0101ori resistance to further land sales and a refusal to acknowledge Crown sovereignty. The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops to mount major campaigns to overpower the K\u012bngitanga (M\u0101ori King) movement and also acquire farming and residential land for British settlers. Later campaigns were aimed at quashing the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai M\u0101rire religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity. At the peak of hostilities in the 1860s, 18,000 British troops, supported by artillery, cavalry and local militia, battled about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors in what became a gross imbalance of manpower and weaponry. Although outnumbered, the M\u0101ori were able to withstand their enemy with techniques that included anti-artillery bunkers and the use of carefully placed p\u0101, or fortified villages, that allowed them to block their enemy's advance and often inflict heavy losses, yet quickly abandon their positions without significant loss.",
