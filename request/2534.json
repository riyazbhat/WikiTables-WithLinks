  "/wiki/Corkscrew_(Valleyfair)": "Corkscrew is  the name of a roller coaster at Valleyfair in Shakopee, Minnesota featuring one vertical loop and two corkscrews. Built in 1980, Corkscrew was planned to reflect the design of its sister roller coaster Corkscrew at Cedar Point. It is notably one of the first roller coasters to feature a double corkscrew, as well as a vertical loop. The main differences that the Valleyfair model has is the addition of a finale helix and the omission of the camelback before the loop. Until the hypercoaster Wild Thing (the fifth highest and fastest roller coaster in the world at the time it opened in 1996), Corkscrew was the only outdoor all-steel roller coaster in Minnesota. Corkscrew is currently the only roller coaster at Valleyfair with inversions. The coaster's track was painted blue when it open in 1980 but was repainted orange and yellow in 2011.",
  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides, especially roller coasters. Based in Clearfield, Utah, the company was the successor to Arrow Development (1946\u20131981) and Arrow Huss (1981\u20131986), which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters. The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, built in 1959, was Arrow's first roller coaster project. In 1975, Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew, at Knott's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews. Arrow created several other \"firsts\" over the years, introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century, The Bat, in 1981, and the world's first \"hypercoaster\", Magnum XL-200, which opened in 1989. They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster, X2, which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002. Arrow Development's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s.",
  "/wiki/Steel_roller_coaster": "A steel roller coaster is a roller coaster that is defined by having a track made of steel. Steel coasters have earned immense popularity in the past 50 years throughout the world. Incorporating tubular steel track and polyurethane-coated wheels, the steel roller coasters can provide a taller, smoother, and faster ride with more inversions than a traditional wooden roller coaster.\n Arrow Dynamics first introduced the steel roller coaster to feature tubular track to the thrill industry with their creations of the Matterhorn Bobsleds (Disneyland) in 1959 and the Runaway Mine Train (Six Flags Over Texas) in 1966.\n As of 2006, the oldest operating steel roller coaster in North America is Little Dipper at Memphis Kiddie Park in Brooklyn, Ohio and has been operating since April 1952. The oldest operating steel rollercoaster in the world is Monta\u00f1a Suiza at Parque de Atracciones Monte Igueldo (Spain). It has been operating since 1928.",
  "/wiki/Cosmic_Coaster_(Valleyfair)": "Cosmic Coaster is a steel junior roller coaster at Valleyfair. \n The ride was originally known as Dragon Coaster when it was located at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania (USA). It was built in 1986 and operated from 1992 through the 2010 season. After 2010, the Dragon Coaster was removed along with the other children's rides in near the former Laser site. Dragon Coaster was moved to Valleyfair where it has operated since 2011 as Cosmic Coaster.\n Cosmic Coaster has a single train with 4 cars, each car with 2 rows of 2 seats each for a total of 16 passengers.",

  "/wiki/Dorney_Park_&_Wildwater_Kingdom": "Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom is an American amusement and water park owned and operated by Cedar Fair and located in between Allentown, Pennsylvania and Emmaus, Pennsylvania. The park features seven roller coasters, other adult and children's rides, and a waterpark, Wildwater Kingdom.\n It features some of the world's most prominent roller coasters, including Steel Force, the ninth longest steel roller coaster in the world and the second longest on the U.S. East Coast.",
  "/wiki/Excalibur_(roller_coaster)": "Excalibur  is a steel roller coaster with a wooden structure located at Valleyfair in Shakopee, Minnesota. It was built in 1989 by Arrow Dynamics, for the cost of $3,000,000. The ride is 105 feet (32 m) tall with a top speed of 54.5 mph (87.7 km/h) and has a minimum height requirement of 48 inches. It follows a customized figure-eight track layout and is rather short for a major roller coaster, with a total ride duration of two minutes and thirteen seconds. Most likely due to its location at the very western edge of the park and the more recently built roller coasters such as Wild Thing, Steel Venom and Renegade, Excalibur typically has a very short wait time. A few years after the ride was built, trim brakes were added at the top of the first hill. The bottom and first half of the turn were re-profiled in an attempt to reduce roughness. The photo spot and the \"Excalibur Photos\" booth were also removed.",
  "/wiki/Wooden_roller_coaster": "A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track. Occasionally, the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss, but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design. The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine, usually grown in the US and the rest of North America.\n Because of the limits of wood, wooden roller coasters, in general, do not have inversions (when the coaster goes upside down), steep drops, or extremely banked turns (overbanked turns). However, there are exceptions, such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City.",
  "/wiki/High_Roller_(Valleyfair)": "High Roller is a wooden roller coaster located at Valleyfair in Shakopee, Minnesota.  High Roller is Valleyfair's oldest roller coaster, being built in 1976 when the park opened.  It is an out-and-back type coaster, and is 70 feet (21 m) at the highest peak with a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h).\n It is a common misperception that High Roller is really the Cyclone from nearby Excelsior Amusement Park, which closed a few years before Valleyfair opened. However, this is not the case.  While High Roller bears some similarities to Cyclone, it was a brand new ride in 1976, and Cyclone was demolished when the Excelsior park closed.",

  "/wiki/Mad_Mouse_(Valleyfair)": "Mad Mouse is a steel Wild Mouse roller coaster at Valleyfair in Shakopee, Minnesota. It was manufactured by Arrow Dynamics and opened on May 8, 1999.",
  "/wiki/Wild_mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster (also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track, taking tight, flat turns (without banking) at modest speeds, yet producing high lateral G-forces. The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops, the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces. When approaching a turn from a straight section, the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight, and thus plunge off of the device, this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach. Almost all Wild Mice feature \"switchback\" sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections. Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0, but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating). Some riders, usually among taller people, report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns. [citation needed]\n The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself, giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out, thus giving it the name \"wild\". Some may include trick-track \u2014 a \"straight\" piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right.",
  "/wiki/Renegade_(Valleyfair)": "Renegade is a wooden roller coaster at Valleyfair in Shakopee, Minnesota, that was designed by Great Coasters International. It was one of the first coasters built by Great Coasters International to use their Millennium Flyer trains, which are designed to give a smoother ride. Renegade's layout is a combination of an out-and-back and a Twister roller coaster.",

  "/wiki/Inverted_Impulse_roller_coaster": "An Impulse roller coaster is a form of a launched inverted roller coaster manufactured by Intamin. The first Impulse roller coaster appeared in Japan, and the ride type has since evolved to include four specific layouts, three of these varieties being built in the United States. It uses LIMs to launch a train out of the station and (in most installations) up a vertical spiral. The train then falls backwards, is powered again through the station, and heads up a back tower. The train then falls forwards, and continues in this fashion for a total of 2\u00bd cycles per ride (three forward launches, two backwards). On the final forward launch, with a slightly reduced speed, the train is sent up the front tower, and brakes then deploy on the launch track. The train then slows down and heads back into the station.",

Its first hill is 207 feet (63 m) with a 60 degree drop, and reaches speeds of up to 74 mph (119 km/h). Wild Thing's height was set by the FAA, due to the nearby presence of Flying Cloud Airport.\n Designed and manufactured by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, it was the first hypercoaster to be built by the company, opening in 1996. It was the 5th tallest coaster in the world when it opened.

  "/wiki/Hyper_coaster": "A hypercoaster is any complete circuit roller coaster with a height measuring greater than 200 feet (61 m). The term was first coined by Arrow Dynamics and Cedar Point in 1989 with the release of the first full-circuit hypercoaster in the world, Magnum XL-200. Other roller coaster manufacturers developed their own models with custom names, including Mega Coasters from Intamin, Hyper Coasters from Bolliger & Mabillard, and Hyper-Hybrid Coasters from Rocky Mountain Construction. The competition between amusement parks to build increasingly taller roller coasters eventually led to giga coasters which exceed 300 feet (91 m) and strata coasters which exceed 400 feet (120 m).",
