  "/wiki/Port_Gibson,_Mississippi": "Port Gibson is a city in Claiborne County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 1,567 at the 2010 census. Port Gibson is the county seat of Claiborne County, which is bordered on the west by the Mississippi River. It is the site of the Claiborne County Courthouse.\n The first European settlers in Port Gibson were French colonists in 1729; it was part of La Louisiane. It was chartered as a town in 1803 after the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase from France. To develop cotton plantations in the area after Indian Removal of the 1830s, planters in the state imported thousands of African-American slaves from the Upper South. The county had a black majority established well before the Civil War; they were overwhelmingly enslaved.\n Several notable people are natives of Port Gibson. The town saw action during the American Civil War. Port Gibson has several historical sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (National Register of Historic Places listings in Claiborne County, Mississippi).\n In the 20th century, Port Gibson was home to The Rabbit's Foot Company. It had a substantial role in the development of blues in Mississippi, including taverns and juke joints now included on the Mississippi Blues Trail. \n With the decline in agriculture and lack of other jobs, the city and rural county have suffered from reduced population and poverty. The peak of population in the city was in 1950. A report in the New York Times in 2002 characterized Port Gibson as 80 percent black and poor, with 20 percent of families living on incomes of less than $10,000 a year, according to the 2000 Census. It also has an \"entrenched population of whites, many of whom are related and have some historical connection to cotton.\"",

  "/wiki/U.S._Route_61": "U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 (US\u00a061) is a major United States highway which extends 1,400 miles (2,300\u00a0km) between New Orleans, Louisiana and the city of Wyoming, Minnesota. The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River, and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35). Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth and across the Canada\u2013U.S. border, near Grand Portage. Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (US 90). The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; the Mississippi Delta, and New Orleans.\nThe route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system. Many southerners traveled north along US\u00a061 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul.\n The highway has a long musical history, being the supposed location where singer-songwriter Robert Johnson made a deal with the Devil for his successes.  The road later gave its name to Minnesota native Bob Dylan's album Highway 61 Revisited and to the song of the same name, which imagines all sorts of fantastical events (including World War III) occurring alongside it. Other notable songs named for the highway include a blues song recorded in 1957 by Sunnyland Slim; one in 1962 by Johnny Young; and a 1981 song, \"61 Highway\", by bluesman James \"Son\" Thomas. To denote US 61's significance in blues music history, there are two markers on the route which are part of the Mississippi Blues Trail: 61 Highway in Vicksburg, Mississippi and Highway 61 Blues in Tunica, Mississippi.",
