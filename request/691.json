It was released by Hudson for the PC Engine in Japan on November 17, 1989 (1989-11-17). It was then released by NEC for the TurboGrafx-16 in North America in 1990.

It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people. Neutopia is widely regarded as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over Zelda, but various shortcomings - which include long passwords unless the system is used in conjunction with an add-on providing battery-backed RAM, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection - prevent the game from being superior to the 1986 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called Neutopia one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. There would eventually be a sequel to the game Neutopia II, in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.",

Music was composed by Masato Ishizaki, while character designs were done by AKIO. The game's title stems from the word ray, as in a ray of light, in reference to the player's raylike weapons used throughout the game. R-Type was celebrated by critics for its graphics and addictive gameplay, although it would receive criticism for its high difficulty level.

  "/wiki/Soldier_Blade": "Soldier Blade[a] is a 1992 vertical-scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Hudson Soft for the TurboGrafx-16. Controlling the titular starship, the player is tasked with completing each of the game's seven stages in order to wipe out the Zeograd Army, an alien race bent on conquering Earth. Power capsules can be collected to give the Soldier Blade access to new weapons, and can even be destroyed to unleash a powerful screen-clearing superweapon. The game is the fourth entry in the Star Soldier series and shares many similarities with its predecessor Super Star Soldier, with Soldier Blade having a heavy emphasis on speed. The initial idea for Soldier Blade came from Hudson designer Uriko Uribo's conversations with other employees over which game to use for the company's upcoming Caravan video game tournament. With the event only six months away, Uribo was hesitant to begin production, however executives from Hudson pushed for him to go forward with the idea. Uribo was simultaneously working on several Game Boy games when development began, giving him less time to focus on the project until these games were completed. The game was originally titled Sonic Blaster F-92, which was changed to Soldier Blade due to trademark issues with another developer. Miscommunication between Uribo and staff lead to several mechanics being altered or changed by mistake, such as several stronger enemies instead being easy to kill. Time and hardware constraints added pressure to the team, leading to several ideas being heavily modified or scrapped entirely. It began development on a 6-megabit HuCard, reduced to a 4-megabit one later on. Although the game was rushed to meet its deadline, Soldier Blade was liked by critics for its gameplay, visuals and power-up system, though some thought it lacked originality and felt inferior to Hudson's previous shooters for the system, namely Blazing Lazers and Final Soldier.",
