Recently, some new markers have been added at junctions with some state highways. However, others were never added, so it may not be easy to find these routes. Also, several of these routes begin on the outskirts of small towns and villages, and there are no signs pointing the way for motorists to find these routes from main streets. \"TO\" signs with arrows would be extremely helpful to motorists, especially in Downsville, Walton, Sidney, and Andes, where the location of the routes can not easily be ascertained. Several county routes are \"unusual\" as they terminate as local roads in remote areas. County Rt. 22 begins on a side street in Walton, and ends as a remote town road in the \"middle of nowhere\". County Route 6 has 2 beginnings on State Route 28, but no connecting center section. County Rt. 36 just climbs a long hill and ends. Many County Maintained Routes in Delaware County have no winter road maintenance (plowing, salting, sanding) at NIGHT due to safety concerns (Mountainous Roads). The county posts signs on these routes warning motorists that there is no nighttime road maintenance in winter months. Otherwise, Delaware County's highways are very well maintained, and are among some of the better quality county highways in the state. The County highways are marked every 1/10 mile with a small blue marker with the Route # on top, and a mileage # on the bottom.",
