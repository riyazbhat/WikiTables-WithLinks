  "/wiki/Sean_Farrell": "Sean Ward Farrell (born May 25, 1960) is a former American football guard who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL. Farrell attended Westhampton Beach High School in Westhampton Beach, New York, where he was a football and track star. He then played college football for Penn State University, where he was named to a number of All-American teams in 1980 and 1981. Farrell was the first round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1982 NFL Draft; Buccaneers management had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese, and Farrell's name was turned in due to a communication error in the draft room. The team then traded the next year's first round pick in order to get Reese as well. Ironically, Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers, while Reese ultimately came to be considered one of the most disappointing draft picks in team history. Tampa Bay's team performance declined during Farrell's years with the team. After his first contract expired in 1985, he signed a one-year contract for the 1986 season based on the team's assurances that things would improve, but the team had another bad year and Farrell made news by publicly telling a group of Bucs fans, \"I know what I want this Christmas .",

  "/wiki/Booker_Reese": "Booker Reese (born September 20, 1959) is a former American football defensive end who played four seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Rams from 1982 to 1985 in the National Football League. Reese is considered to be the biggest draft bust in Buccaneers history. Reese played college football in Bethune-Cookman College and was drafted in the second round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Buccaneers. The Buccaneers intended to draft him in the first round, but a broken communication resulted in their mistakenly drafting Sean Farrell. They were so convinced of his talent that they traded a future first round pick in the 1983 NFL Draft to get him, despite advance knowledge that 1983 would be a particularly strong draft class. Although highly talented, Reese had trouble making the mental adjustment to professional football. Frustration over his inability to excel, along with his unpreparedness for the NFL lifestyle, led to problems with alcohol and cocaine. Reese's best season in the NFL came in 1983.",
