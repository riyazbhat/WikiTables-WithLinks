  "/wiki/Sean_Farrell": "Sean Ward Farrell (born May 25, 1960) is a former American football guard who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL.  Farrell attended Westhampton Beach High School in Westhampton Beach, New York, where he was a football and track star.  He then played college football for Penn State University, where he was named to a number of All-American teams in 1980 and 1981.\n Farrell was the first round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1982 NFL Draft; Buccaneers management had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese, and Farrell's name was turned in due to a communication error in the draft room.  The team then traded the next year's first round pick in order to get Reese as well.  Ironically, Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers, while Reese ultimately came to be considered one of the most disappointing draft picks in team history.\n Tampa Bay's team performance declined during Farrell's years with the team.  After his first contract expired in 1985, he signed a one-year contract for the 1986 season based on the team's assurances that things would improve, but the team had another bad year and Farrell made news by publicly telling a group of Bucs fans, \"I know what I want this Christmas . . . I want to get the hell out of Tampa Bay.\" New England acquired him in return for three draft picks, and he was the Patriots' starting guard for three seasons before shoulder surgery kept him on the injured reserve list for most of the 1990 season.  Near the end of that season, the Patriots tried to reactivate him without using a protective designation for him; under the rules then applicable, this had the effect of putting him on waivers, and he was claimed by the Denver Broncos.  He finished that year and played another in Denver, then one more for Seattle before concluding his NFL career.\n After football, Farrell became a financial advisor with several investment companies including Merrill Lynch, and he is the chairperson of the Gay Culverhouse Player Outreach Program to assist former NFL players facing disability issues after their careers.",

  "/wiki/Booker_Reese": "Booker Reese (born September 20, 1959) is a former American football defensive end who played four seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Rams from 1982 to 1985 in the National Football League. Reese is considered to be the biggest draft bust in Buccaneers history.\n Reese played college football in Bethune-Cookman College and was drafted in the second round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Buccaneers. The Buccaneers intended to draft him in the first round, but a broken communication resulted in their mistakenly drafting Sean Farrell. They were so convinced of his talent that they traded a future first round pick in the 1983 NFL Draft to get him, despite advance knowledge that 1983 would be a particularly strong draft class. Although highly talented, Reese had trouble making the mental adjustment to professional football. Frustration over his inability to excel, along with his unpreparedness for the NFL lifestyle, led to problems with alcohol and cocaine. Reese's best season in the NFL came in 1983. He played in all 16 games that season, scoring one sack and two interceptions. Reese only lasted two seasons with the Bucs before being traded to the Rams for a 12th round draft pick in 1984. He played eleven games with the Rams, who then sent him to rehab and released him. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 1985, but was released before the season after again failing a drug test. Ironically, the man that the Buccaneers drafted initially due to the communication error, Sean Farrell, would go on to have a productive NFL career that lasted a decade.\n Reese served two two-year sentences at Okaloosa Correctional Institution for cocaine possession and parole violation: one from 2002 to 2004, and another from 2005 to 2007.",

Stanford was known as the \"Indians\" from 1930 to January 1972, and the \"Cardinals\" from 1972 through 1981. A student vote in December 1975 to change the nickname to \"Robber Barons\" was not approved by administrators.\n Stanford has fielded football teams every year since 1892 with a few exceptions. Like a number of other teams from the era concerned with violence in the sport, the school dropped football in favor of rugby from 1906 to 1917.

The 1940 team went unbeaten and untied after defeating Nebraska 21\u201313 in the 1941 Rose Bowl, but the team ranked #2 in the final AP poll released before the game was played.\n Pop Warner's era predated the AP poll, but Stanford has finished at least one season in the Top 10 in six different decades under seven different coaches: Claude E.

  "/wiki/1982_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season": "The 1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season was the franchise's 7th season in the National Football League the 7th playing their home games at Tampa Stadium and the 7th under head coach John McKay. The Bucs were regarded for the first time as a regular playoff contender. They were considered by some to be the best Buccaneer team yet, despite a mediocre offensive line and the lack of a feature running back. The team played only two games before the players\u2019 union called a labor strike, which resulted in a nine-game season. The season began with a three-game losing streak, as the Buccaneers outplayed their opponent statistically in each game, but showed a tendency for mental errors at crucial moments. The first game in which they were outgained by their opponent was their first win, a franchise-first victory over the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football. The team made a playoff run against a difficult schedule, facing only two opponents with losing records. Their schedule included all four eventual Conference Championship participants. They overcame double-digit deficits to win on last-minute field goals in their final two games (kicker Bill Capece was the NFC's second-leading scorer), and had to survive opponents\u2019 last-minute rallies in all five of their victories. In the strike-season playoff format in which the top eight conference teams made the playoffs, the Buccaneers\u2019 seventh-place finish gave them a first-round matchup with the Dallas Cowboys. Despite a poor performance by the offense, the Buccaneers carried a 17\u201316 lead into the fourth quarter, before the Cowboys rallied for a 30\u201317 victory following a controversial penalty call. This would be the last playoff appearance of the John McKay era, and was followed by fourteen consecutive losing seasons.\n The year began with longtime defensive coordinator Tom Bass and several players leaving for San Diego. Observers questioned why Bass, who had built the defenses that had ranked at or near the top of the league statistically over the last several years, would leave; and further, why so many of the team's top players and former MVPs had been traded away. The team unveiled a new, Wayne Fontes-designed defensive philosophy, featuring tighter coverage to reduce the number of small gains, and increased blitzing to thwart opponents\u2019 practice of double-teaming Lee Roy Selmon. The team continued to be regarded as having one of the quickest, hardest-hitting defenses in the NFL, a defense which ranked first in the NFC. In the later part of the season, the offense began to jell, taking a part in the victories more equal to that which the defense played. In particular, the line allowed the fewest sacks in the league, while providing an improved running game. The offense as a whole developed an ability to rally from deficits. However, they continued to be criticized as overly conservative, as they scored just 9 first-quarter points in their 10 games, and opened up their passing attack only when behind late in games. This became an issue in the playoff loss to Dallas, where Doug Williams was unable to recover from a bad start. Following the season, the Buccaneers were represented by Jimmie Giles, Hugh Green, and Lee Roy Selmon in the Pro Bowl."
