Its population in 2013 was of 182,592 in the city proper (commune) and 317,611 in the metropolitan area (aire urbaine). The city lies 129 km (80 mi) east-northeast of Paris. Its primary river, the Vesle, is a tributary of the Aisne. Founded by the Gauls, Reims became a major city during the period of the Roman Empire. Reims later played a prominent ceremonial role in French monarchical history as the traditional site of the coronation of the kings of France. The royal anointing was performed at the Cathedral of Reims, which housed the Holy Ampulla of chrism allegedly brought by a white dove at the baptism of Frankish king Clovis I in 496. For this reason, Reims is often referred to in French as la cit\u00e9 des sacres (the Coronation City).",

He began to sell his champagne abroad, starting in Belgium and in England, and in 1852 he travelled to the United States, becoming the first merchant to market his own champagne there. He was a larger than life dandy and became something of a social sensation, one New York newspaper describing him as Champagne Charlie. He visited on three further occasions until the American Civil War disrupted trade. He returned to New York in an unsuccessful effort to recover debts owed by his agents and on visiting the south he became trapped by the conflict. In July 1862, Charles Heidsieck was arrested as a spy while travelling to New Orleans trying to flee back to France. He was sent to the infamous Fort Jackson in Louisiana.",
