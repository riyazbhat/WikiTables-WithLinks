  "/wiki/Rapunzel": "\"Rapunzel\" (/r\u0259\u02c8p\u028cnz\u0259l/; German: [\u0281a\u02c8p\u028ant\u0361s\u0259l]) is a German fairy tale in the collection assembled by the Brothers Grimm, and first published in 1812 as part of Children's and Household Tales. [citation needed] The Grimm Brothers' story is an adaptation of the fairy tale Rapunzel by (J. Achim Christoph) Friedrich Schulz published in his collection Kleine Romane (German: Little Romances (1790). The Schulz version is based on Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force originally published in 1698 which in turn was influenced by an even earlier Italian tale, Petrosinella by Giambattista Basile, published in 1634. Its plot has been used and parodied in various media and its best known line (\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair\") is an idiom of popular culture. In volume I of the 1812 annotations (Anhang), it is listed as coming from Friedrich Schulz's Kleine Romane, Book 5, pp. 269\u2013288, published in Leipzig 1790. In the Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system for folktales it is type 310, \"The Maiden in The Tower\". Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.",

For three decades in the 20th century, it was a prominent force and leader in American television animation as it created a variety of popular animated characters and a succession of cartoon series, including The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Flintstones, The Yogi Bear Show, The Jetsons, Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! and The Smurfs. Its cartoons won eight Emmys and seven Oscars and in addition, Hanna and Barbera were honored a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The two men and Sidney sold the studio to Taft Broadcasting on December 29, 1966. By the mid-1980s, when the profitability of Saturday-morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication, Hanna-Barbera's fortunes had declined. Turner Broadcasting System purchased the studio from Taft (by then renamed Great American Broadcasting) in late 1991 and used much of its back catalog as the foundation and programming for Cartoon Network and later Boomerang. After Turner purchased the company, Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as creative consultants and mentors.",
