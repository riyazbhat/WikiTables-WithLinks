With a population of 4,587,558 in the urban centre (2014) and 5,150,072 in its province (2015), it is Turkey's second largest city after Istanbul (the former imperial capital), having outranked \u0130zmir in the 20th century. Ankara covers an area of 24,521 km2 (9,468 sq mi).\n On 23 April 1920 the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was established in Ankara, which became the headquarters of Atat\u00fcrk and the Turkish National Movement during the Turkish War of Independence. Ankara became the new Turkish capital upon the establishment of the Republic on 29 October 1923, succeeding in this role the former Turkish capital Istanbul (Constantinople) following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The government is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the centre of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the Angora wool shorn from Angora rabbits, the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair), and the Angora cat. The area is also known for its pears, honey and muscat grapes. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at 72 square metres (775 square feet) per head.\n Ankara is a very old city with various Hittite, Phrygian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman archaeological sites. The historical centre of town is a rocky hill rising 150\u00a0m (500\u00a0ft) over the left bank of the Ankara \u00c7ay\u0131, a tributary of the Sakarya River, the classical Sangarius. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of the old citadel. Although few of its outworks have survived, there are well-preserved examples of Roman and Ottoman architecture throughout the city, the most remarkable being the 20\u00a0BC Temple of Augustus and Rome that boasts the Monumentum Ancyranum, the inscription recording the Res Gestae Divi Augusti.",

Since 1984 the PKK has been involved in an armed conflict with the Turkish state (with cease-fires in 1999\u20132004 and 2013\u20132015), with the initial aim of achieving an independent Kurdish state. In March 2016, the PKK joined the Peoples' United Revolutionary Movement, an alliance with the aim of overthrowing the Turkish \"fascist\" AKP government of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The PKK has been designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States, the European Union, Australia and Japan.\n The PKK was founded in November 1978 in the village of Fis (near Lice), by a group of Kurdish students led by Abdullah \u00d6calan. \u00d6calan was elected the General Secretary and Hayri Durmu\u015f, Kemal Pir, Cem\u00eel Bayik, Kesire Yildirim, Mazlum Do\u011dan, Mehmet Karasungur and \u015eahin D\u00f6nmez were part of the Central Committee. \n It announced its existence the following year. The PKK's ideology was originally a fusion of revolutionary socialism and Kurdish nationalism, seeking the foundation of an independent communist Kurdistan. The initial reasons given by the PKK for this were the oppression of Kurds in Turkey and under capitalism. At this time, the use of the Kurdish language, dress, folklore, and names were banned by the Turkish state, including the words \"Kurds\" and \"Kurdistan\". Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life. Many who spoke, published, or sang in Kurdish were arrested and imprisoned. The PKK was then formed, as part of a growing discontent over the suppression of Turkey's ethnic Kurds, in an effort to establish linguistic, cultural, and political rights for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority.\n The PKK has been involved in armed clashes with Turkish security forces since its foundation, but the full-scale insurgency did not begin until 15 August 1984, when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising. Since the conflict began, more than 40,000 have died, most of whom were Kurdish civilians killed by the Turkish security forces.\n In 1999, PKK leader \u00d6calan was captured and imprisoned. In May 2007, former members of the PKK helped form the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), an umbrella organisation of Kurds from Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. In 2013, the PKK declared a ceasefire agreement and began slowly withdrawing its fighters to the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq as part of the solution process between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority. \n Since July 2015, when the ceasefire broke down, violent actions inside Turkey from the government against the PKK and vice versa kept occurring, supplemented with Turkish military action in 2018 against PKK fighters in Iraq, and both in January 2018 and October 2019 against Kurdish political groups (PYD) \nand forces (YPG and YPJ) in Syria which according to Turkey and some observers are strongly tied to the PKK (see 'clashing' details in: Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)#2015\u2013present).",

  "/wiki/Konya": "Konya (Turkish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8kon.ja]) is a major city in south-western edge of the Central Anatolian Plateau and is the seventh-most-populous city in Turkey with a metropolitan population of over 2.1 million. Konya is an economically and industrially developed city and the capital of Konya Province.\n The Konya region has been inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. Known as Iconium during classical antiquity, the city was ruled successively by the Phrygian, Persian, Hellenistic and Roman civilizations. In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks conquered the area from the Byzantines, and Konya then became the capital of the Sultanate of Rum. Under the Seljuks, the city reached the height of its wealth and influence. Following the demise of Rum, Konya came under the rule of the Karamanids, before being taken over by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. After the Turkish War of Independence the city became part of the modern Republic of Turkey.",

  "/wiki/Amasya": "Amasya (Greek: \u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) is a city in northern Turkey and is the capital of Amasya Province, in the Black Sea Region. Tokat from east, Tokat and Yozgat from south, \u00c7orum from west, Samsun from north.\n The city of Amasya (Turkish pronunciation:\u00a0[a\u02c8masja]), the Amaseia or Amasia of antiquity, stands in the mountains above the Black Sea coast, set apart from the rest of Anatolia in a narrow valley along the banks of the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak River. Although near the Black Sea, this area is high above the coast and has an inland climate, well-suited to growing apples, for which Amasya province, one of the provinces in north-central Anatolia Turkey, is famed. It was the home of the geographer Strabo and the birthplace of the 15th century scholar and physician Amirdovlat Amasiatsi. Located in a narrow cleft of the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak (Iris) river, it has a history of 7,500 years which has left many traces still evident today.\n In antiquity, Amaseia was a fortified city high on the cliffs above the river. It has a long history as a wealthy provincial capital, producing kings and princes, artists, scientists, poets and thinkers, from the kings of Pontus, through Strabo the geographer, to many generations of the Ottoman imperial dynasty. With its Ottoman-period wooden houses and the tombs of the Pontus kings carved into the cliffs overhead, Amasya is attractive to visitors. In recent years there has been a lot of investment in tourism and more foreign and Turkish tourists visit the city.\n During the early Ottoman rule, it was customary for young Ottoman princes to be sent to Amasya to govern and gain experience. Amasya was also the birthplace of the Ottoman sultans Murad I and Selim I. It is thus of great importance in terms of Ottoman history. Traditional Ottoman houses near the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak and the other main historical buildings have been restored; these traditional Yal\u0131boyu houses are now used as cafes, restaurants, pubs and hotels. Behind the Ottoman wooden houses one can see the rock tombs of the Pontic kings.",
