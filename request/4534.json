He was born in Reggio Emilia, Italy and moved to France with his parents at the age of eight.\n After studying acting at the Conservatoire des arts cin\u00e9matographiques, he was discovered by Jean Cocteau and appeared in the wartime production of Les Parents terribles. He then left Paris to join the French Resistance.\n His first feature film was Les portes de la nuit (\"Gates of the Night\"), released in 1946. He went on to perform in 80 films in total, including Casque d'or, Les Mis\u00e9rables (1958),Tutti a casa, Le Doulos, Il Gattopardo, La terrazza, The Pianist (1998).\n Reggiani also triumphed in the theatre in 1959 with his performance in Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s play Les S\u00e9questr\u00e9s d'Altona.  In 1961, Reggiani co-starred with Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier in the film Paris Blues filmed on location in Paris.\n In 1965, at the age of 43, he began a second career as a singer, with the help of Simone Signoret and her husband Yves Montand, and later with the assistance of the French singer Barbara. Reggiani became one of the most acclaimed performers of French chanson and although he was in his 40s, his rugged image made him popular with both younger and older listeners. His best-known songs include Les loups sont entr\u00e9s dans Paris (\"The Wolves Have Entered Paris\") and Sarah (La femme qui est dans mon lit) (\"The Woman Who Is In My Bed\"), the latter written by Georges Moustaki. He regularly sang songs by Boris Vian (Le D\u00e9serteur, Arthur o\u00f9 t'as mis le corps, La Java des bombes atomiques). His new young fans identified with his left-wing ideals and anti-militarism, most notably during the student revolts in France in 1968. With age he became more and more acclaimed as one of the best interpreters of the chanson, and also for bringing the poems of Rimbaud, Apollinaire and Pr\u00e9vert to new audiences.\n From 1980, when his son died, Reggiani struggled with alcoholism and depression. In 1995, however, he made a comeback to singing, giving a few concerts despite his deteriorated health and personal distress, the last one being held as late as the spring of 2004.\n In later life, he became a painter and gave a number of exhibitions of his works.\n Serge Reggiani died in Paris of a heart attack at the age of 82, one day after the death of another well-known French singer, Sacha Distel.

  "/wiki/Accattone": "Accattone is a 1961 Italian drama film written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. Despite being filmed from an original screenplay,  Accattone is often perceived as a cinematic rendition of Pasolini's earlier novels, particularly The Ragazzi and Violent Life. It was Pasolini's first film as director, employing what would later be seen as trademark Pasolini characteristics; a cast of non-professional actors hailing from where the movie is set, and thematic emphasis on impoverished individuals.\n While many people were surprised by Pasolini's shift from literature to film, he had considered attending the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome before World War II. Pasolini had collaborated with Federico Fellini on Le notti di Cabiria and considered cinema to be writing with reality. The word accattone [akkat\u02c8to:ne] is an informal term meaning \"vagabond\" or \"scrounger\".\nAccattone is a story of pimps, prostitutes and thieves, types also represented in his novels. The life of the working (and not-working) poor is depicted, in contrast to Italy's postwar economic reforms. Pasolini\u2019s choice of topics was scandalous at the time, as was his blurring of the lines between the sacred and the profane. Although Pasolini tried to distance himself from neorealism, the film is considered to be a kind of second-generation neorealism, with one critic believing it \"may be the grimmest movie\" he'd ever seen.",
