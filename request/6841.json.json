The PPS harnesses the Newtonian effect as a result of the ionisation of xenon gas employed by the use of Hall effect plasma thrusters. This system is most commonly used for North-South station-keeping. The E3000 was the first commercial satellite family to use lithium-ion batteries rather than the older nickel-based technologies for power supply during eclipses.",
