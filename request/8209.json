The road continues east as a divided parkway until it passes the dual-intersection with 4 Street NE and Edmonton Trail at which point it becomes a freeway until Deerfoot Trail (at which point it downgrades to an at-grade expressway). (Westbound traffic is offered a flyover into downtown at the 4th/Edmonton intersection.
