  "/wiki/Tippecanoe_Battlefield_Park": "The Tippecanoe Battlefield Park preserves the location of the Battle of Tippecanoe fought on November 7, 1811.\n The 16-acre (6.5\u00a0ha) site of the battle was deeded to the State of Indiana by John Tipton, a veteran of the fight, on November 7, 1836, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the battle. The site was used for a number of major political rallies during its earlier years, those most significant being on May 29, 1840 in favor of William Henry Harrison's bid for the White House attended by 30,000 people.\n The location was attracting visitors by the 1850s, and the battlefield was bordered by the Louisville, New Albany, & Salem Railroad during that decade. A refreshment stand was built adjacent to the site to accommodate visitors, and this land was later purchased by the Northwest Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church and used for the Battle Ground Collegiate Institute and later for a Methodist youth camp. Despite interest in the location for the sesquicentennial of the battle in 1961, the camp was abandoned in 1971 and the location was neglected. It was designated a National Historical Landmark in 1960.  It is located in the Battle Ground Historic District.\n Local residents acquired the Methodist property upon its closure, and created a museum in the camp's lodge. The citizen's group merged with the Tippecanoe County Historical Association in 1990 which took over operation of the museum. The museum was extensively renovated in 1995.\n The Battlefield Monument was ceded to the Tippecanoe County Park Board in 1972.",

  "/wiki/Lafayette,_Indiana": "When European explorers arrived at the area around what is now Tippecanoe County, it was inhabited by a tribe of Miami Indians known as the Ouiatenon or Weas. In 1717, the French government established Fort Ouiatenon across the Wabash River and three miles (5\u00a0km) south of present-day Lafayette. The fort became the center of trade for fur trappers, merchants and Indians. An annual reenactment and festival known as Feast of the Hunters' Moon takes place there each autumn.\n The town of Lafayette was platted in May 1825 by William Digby, a trader. It was designated as the county seat of the newly formed Tippecanoe County the following year. Like many frontier towns, Lafayette was named for General Lafayette, a French officer who significantly aided George Washington's Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Lafayette toured the United States in 1824 and 1825.\n In its earliest days, Lafayette was a shipping center on the Wabash River. In 1838, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, the first United States Patent Commissioner, published a booklet titled Valley of the Upper Wabash, Indiana, with Hints on Its Agricultural Advantages, to promote settlement of the region. By 1845, Ellsworth had purchased 93,000 acres (380\u00a0km2) of farmland in and around Lafayette and moved there from Connecticut to supervise land sales. By 1847 Ellsworth was distributing broadsides looking for farmers to purchase his farmland. He became president of the Tippecanoe County Agricultural Society in April 1851 \u2013 despite some local resentment over what was called \"the Yale Crowd\" \u2013 but he was defeated the same year when he ran for the Indiana House of Representatives. Ellsworth Street and Ellsworth Historic District are named for the early real estate developer.\n The Wabash and Erie Canal in the 1840s stimulated trade and affirmed Lafayette's regional prominence. Railroads arrived in the town in the 1850s, connecting it with other major markets. The Monon Railroad connected Lafayette with other sections of Indiana.\n Lafayette was the site of the first official air mail delivery in the United States, which took place on August 17, 1859, when John Wise piloted a balloon starting on the Lafayette courthouse grounds.  Wise hoped to reach New York; however, weather conditions forced the balloon down near Crawfordsville, Indiana, and the mail reached its final destination by train. In 1959, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 7\u00a2 airmail stamp commemorating the centennial of the event.\n In 1992, the Greater Lafayette area (Lafayette and West Lafayette) was the first place in Indiana to experience the internet during the initial college town connection launching.",

  "/wiki/Fort_Ouiatenon": "Fort Ouiatenon, built in 1717, was the first fortified European settlement in what is now called Indiana.  It was a palisade stockade with log blockhouse used as a French trading post on the Wabash River located approximately three miles southwest of modern-day West Lafayette. The name  'Ouiatenon' is a French rendering of the name in the Wea language, waayaahtanonki, meaning 'place of the whirlpool'.  It was one of three French forts built during the 18th century in what was then New France, later the Northwest Territory and today the state of Indiana, the other two being Fort Miami and Fort Vincennes. A substantial French settlement grew up around the fort in the mid-18th century.  It was ceded to the British and abandoned after the French and Indian war. Later, it passed into Indian hands and was destroyed in 1791 by American militia during the Northwest Indian War. It was never a U.S. fort. The original site was rediscovered in the 1960s and is now an archaeological site on the National Register of Historical Places.\n Every year between the end of September and the month of October, a reenactment of pioneer life called the Feast of the Hunters' Moon is held at a replica of the fort built a short distance from the original site.",
