  "/wiki/Ernesto_Ramos_Antonini": "Ernesto Ramos Antonini [note 1] (April 24, 1898 - January 9, 1963) was the President of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico and co-founder of the Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico de Puerto Rico (Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico).",
  "/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The Popular Democratic Party (Spanish: Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico, PPD) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates to continue as a Commonwealth of the United States with self-government. [a][b] The party was founded in 1938 by dissidents from the Puerto Rican Liberal Party and the Unionist Party and originally promoted policies on the center-left. [c] In recent years, however, its leaders have described the party as centrist. [d][e]\n As one of the long-standing parties on the island, the PPD has played a significant role in the history of Puerto Rico. In the early 1950s, for example, the party held a majority in the delegation convened to draft the Constitution of Puerto Rico. Once the constitution was ratified, the document was proclaimed by the party's leader and co-founder, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn - who, in doing so, became the first Puerto Rican governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico. The party ruled all branches of the Puerto Rican government afterward for 36 of the past 68 years, while establishing many of the institutions that permeate Puerto Rican society today. Today, the party is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength. In the executive branch, the party's last governor was Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla who governed the island from 2013-2017. It also holds minorities in the legislative and judicial branches by holding minorities in the Senate, in the House, and in the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, however, is from the PPD; a circumstance that allows the party to designate political appointees in the judicial branch since the Chief Justice is also constitutionally the chief judicial administrator. Finally, in the municipal landscape, the party holds more than half of the seats of mayors.",

  "/wiki/New_Progressive_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The New Progressive Party (Spanish: Partido Nuevo Progresista, PNP) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates statehood. The PNP is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength and currently holds both the seat of the governor and of the resident commissioner. In legislative matters, the party has a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives; a majority that gives the party full control over all legislations, including constitutional amendments, without political opposition. These majorities over the legislative branch, the control over the governorship seat, and a majority of Supreme Court justices affiliated with the party give the PNP absolute control over all three branches of government without political opposition. The party, however, has a minority in the number of mayors on the island. Domestically, the party is primarily contrasted by two other political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), which advocates maintaining the current political status of Puerto Rico as that of an unincorporated territory of the United States with self-government, and the smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), which advocates for the independence of Puerto Rico. [a][b]\n In national/mainland politics, members are split, with some party members affiliating with the Republican Party and some with the Democratic Party. The party traces its history back to 1967. In that year, the Partido Estadista Republicano instructed its members to not participate in a referendum held that year. Unhappy with the mandate, several dissidents left the Statehood Party and founded the PNP afterwards.",
