Nehmer grew up on R\u00fcgen, the son of a farmer. Prior to his role in bobsleigh, Nehmer competed in athletics as a javelin thrower, with a personal best of 81.5 m. After retiring from javelin competition at the age of 30, he was recruited into bobsleigh by coach Horst H\u00f6rnlein at the relatively advanced age of 32, although Nehmer initially believed that taking up a new sport at that age would not be worthwhile. At the time of his first Olympic success in 1976, he had only been bobsledding for three years. Retiring from bobsleigh in the early 1980s, Nehmer worked for the Volksmarine, rising to the rank of Commander (Fregattenkapit\u00e4n in (in German)), before being forced out following German reunification in late 1990.",
