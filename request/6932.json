  "/wiki/ICC_ODI_Championship": "The ICC ODI Championship is an international One Day International (ODI) cricket competition run by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The competition is notional in that it is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular ODI match schedule. After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. Each team's points total is divided by their total number of matches played to give a rating, and all the teams are ranked in a table in order of rating.\n By analogy to cricket batting averages, the points for winning an ODI match are always greater than the team's rating, increasing the rating, and the points for losing an ODI match are always less than the rating, reducing the rating. A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An \"average\" team that wins as often as it loses while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams should have a rating of 100.\n As of 13 November 2019[update], England lead the ICC ODI Championship with a rating of 125 from 54 weighted matches, while the lowest rated team, Papua New Guinea, has a rating of 0 from 17 weighted matches.",
