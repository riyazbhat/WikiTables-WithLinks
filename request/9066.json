  "/wiki/Alpine_Tunnel": "Alpine Tunnel is a 1,772\u00a0ft (540\u00a0m) narrow gauge railroad tunnel located east of Pitkin, Colorado on the former Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad route from Denver to Gunnison.  At an elevation of 11,523 feet (3,512\u00a0m), it was the first tunnel constructed through the Continental Divide in Colorado, and according to the U.S. Forest Service \"remains the highest railroad tunnel and the longest narrow gauge tunnel in North America.\"  However, it did not last long in service.  Construction began in January 1880 and was scheduled to last for six months but instead dragged on until July 1882, and the line was abandoned in 1910 due to minor damage in the tunnel.  Now the tunnel is sealed shut and the remaining trackbed serves as a trail for hikers and off-road vehicles.",
  "/wiki/Denver,_South_Park_and_Pacific_Railroad": "The Denver, South Park, and Pacific Railroad (later called the Denver, Leadville and Gunnison Railway) was a historic 3\u00a0ft (914\u00a0mm) narrow gauge railroad that operated in Colorado in the western United States in the late 19th century. The railroad opened up the first rail routes to a large section of the central Colorado mining district in the decades of the mineral boom. The railroad took its name from the fact that its main line from Denver ascended the Platte Canyon and traversed South Park. Founded in 1872 by Colorado Governor John Evans, the company was purchased by the Union Pacific Railway in 1880, though it continued to be operated independently. The line went bankrupt in 1889 and was reorganized under the new moniker the Denver, Leadville and Gunnison Railway. When the Union Pacific went bankrupt in 1893, the DL&G lines went into receivership and were eventually sold to the Colorado and Southern Railway. In the first half of the 20th century, nearly all the company's original lines were dismantled or converted into 4\u00a0ft\u00a08\u00a01\u20442\u00a0in (1,435\u00a0mm) standard gauge. The last train to run the old DSP&P tracks was from Como, Colorado on April 11, 1937. A section of the standard gauge line between Leadville and Climax is still operated as a passenger excursion railroad called the Leadville, Colorado and Southern Railroad. At its peak the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad had 335 miles (539\u00a0km) of narrow gauge line, making it the largest narrow gauge railroad in the state of Colorado.",
