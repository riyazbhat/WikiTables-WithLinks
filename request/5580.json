  "/wiki/First_Presbyterian_Church_and_Manse_(Baltimore,_Maryland)": "First Presbyterian Church and Manse is a historic Presbyterian church located at West Madison Street and Park Avenue in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The church is a rectangular brick building with a central tower flanked by protruding octagonal turrets at each corner. At the north end of the church is a two-story building appearing to be a transept and sharing a common roof with the church, but is separated from the auditorium by a bearing wall. The manse is a three-story stone-faced building. The church was begun about 1854 by Nathan G. Starkweather and finished by his assistant Edmund G. Lind around 1873. It is a notable example of Gothic Revival architecture and a landmark in the City of Baltimore.\n The steeple is the tallest in Baltimore at 273 feet (83 m) and was completed by 1875, supported by clusters of cast iron columns. A subsidiary spire to the right is 125 feet (38 m) high, and the smaller, on the southwest corner, is 78 feet high. Wendel Bollman fabricated much of the ironwork at his Patapsco Bridge and Ironworks and is famous for several iron truss bridges throughout the region especially on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The manse, or rectory, is located to the left, or west of the entrance. Stonework is a red freestone or sandstone from New Brunswick.\n First Presbyterian Church and Manse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is now known as the First and Franklin Presbyterian Church, after merging in 1973 with the former Franklin Street Presbyterian Church several blocks to the south at the northwest corner of West Franklin and Cathedral Streets, across from the central Enoch Pratt Free Library and the Old Baltimore Cathedral (now the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary which was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist Protestant congregation. Franklin Street Church was built in 1847 and designed in English Tudor Revival style by Robert Cary Long, Jr. and Col. Robert Snowden Andrews, C.S.A. (who also designed the earliest Eastern High School on Aisquith and Orleans Streets).\n First Presbyterian Church is the oldest Presbyterian congregation in Baltimore, founded in 1761, then located after 1763 at East Fayette and North Streets (later Guilford Avenue) on the northwest corner in downtown which was the site for three its succeeding buildings until 1859, when the site was purchased by the Federal Government and constructed a U.S. Courthouse there, dedicated by President James Buchanan in 1860, later replaced by another courthouse on the entire block in 1889 and finally the current one in 1932, which is now \"Courthouse East\" for the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City.  It was instrumental in the establishment of the local Presbytery of Baltimore and many \"daughter congregations\" such as Second Presbyterian Church and others. The church and manse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1973. They are included in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.",

In addition, Baltimore was a major manufacturing center. After a decline in major manufacturing, heavy industry, and restructuring of the rail industry, Baltimore has shifted to a service-oriented economy. Johns Hopkins Hospital (founded 1889) and Johns Hopkins University (founded 1876) are the city's top two employers.\n With hundreds of identified districts, Baltimore has been dubbed a \"city of neighborhoods.\" Famous residents have included writers Edgar Allan Poe, Edith Hamilton, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois,  Ogden Nash, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dashiell Hammett, Upton Sinclair, Tom Clancy, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and H. L.

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in Baltimore after the bombardment of Fort McHenry. His poem was set to music and popularized as a song; in 1931 it was designated as the American national anthem.\n Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country, and is home to some of the earliest National Register Historic Districts in the nation, including Fell's Point, Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. These were added to the National Register between 1969 and 1971, soon after historic preservation legislation was passed. Nearly one third of the city's buildings (over 65,000) are designated as historic in the National Register, which is more than any other U.S. city.",
  "/wiki/Franklin_Street_Presbyterian_Church_and_Parsonage": "Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and Parsonage is a historic Presbyterian church located at 100 West Franklin Street at Cathedral Street, northwest corner in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The church is a rectangular Tudor Gothic building dedicated in 1847, with an addition in 1865.

The manse / parsonage at the north end has similar matching walls of brick, heavy Tudor-Gothic window hoods, and battlements atop the roof and was built in 1857.\n This church was incorporated in 1844 by a group of men from the First Presbyterian Church then located at the northwest corner of East Fayette Street and North Street (now Guilford Avenue) in downtown (later relocated in 1854 to West Madison Street and Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood after selling their previous third church building of 1790-95 to the Federal Government which built a U.S. Courthouse there [to 1889, replaced again 1932] dedicated in 1860 by 16th President James Buchanan). They felt the need for a new church in that fast-growing northern section of the city formerly \"Howard's Woods\" of Col. John Eager Howard's (Revolutionary War commander of the famed \"Maryland Line\" regiment of the Continental Army)  country estate \"Belvidere\" (mansion located at intersection of North Calvert and East Chase Streets, razed 1875) where the Washington Monument was erected with its four surrounding park squares just two blocks from their new building.\n Franklin Street Church was also located on \"Cathedral Hill\" in the southern part of the community bordering downtown Baltimore to the south and across the street from the old Baltimore Cathedral (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, erected 1806-1821 and designed by Benjamin Latrobe - first Catholic cathedral constructed in America. Later in 1882\u20131886, philanthropist Enoch Pratt founded his central library for the new Enoch Pratt Free Library then facing West Mulberry Street at Cathedral, a block further south which was replaced in 1931-33 by a new central library building facing Cathedral Street and encompassing the entire block and now directly across Franklin Street from the F.S.P.C.\n In 1973, the two historic downtown area congregations reunited to form The First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and was centered at the First Church site on West Madison and Park. The Franklin Street building was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist independent Protestant congregation and later re-sold to the present \"New Unity Church Ministries\".\n Across Cathedral Street to the northeast was the 1820s era Greek Revival style home with large front columns, designed by Robert Mills (who also did the iconic landmark Washington Monument two blocks away) which later was occupied by the original Maryland Club, an exclusive Southern-leaning dining and leisure society of gentlemen, founded 1857 that was once threatened by Massachusetts State Militia commander, Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, U.S.A. when he occupied Baltimore on May 13, 1861, a month after the infamous \"Pratt Street Riots\", when mobs of Southern sympathizing Baltimoreans attacked passing state militia from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania at the beginning of the Civil War on Thursday/Friday, April 18-19th. General Butler's troops fortified Federal Hill with a battery redoubt named Fort Federal Hill and with numerous cannons overlooking the harbor basin (later renamed \"Inner Harbor\" in the 1960s) and surrounding city, \"to put a shot into it\" if he spied a reputed rebel flag flying or any discontent to the Union Army declared martial law. The Club later moved a few city blocks further north to North Charles and East Eager Streets in 1892 and the Cathedral and Franklin mansion was later replaced in 1907-08 by the former Central Building of the Young Men's Christian Association of Central Maryland (YMCA) which was closed in 1984 and the building renovated as the Mount Vernon Hotel and Caf\u00e9, and again subsequently as the Hotel Indigo in 2017.\n The church is no longer used by a Presbyterian congregation and is currently occupied since the 1970s by the New Unity Church Ministries / New Unity Baptist Church, with Pastor Johnny N. Golden, sr. John Gresham Machen, the founder of Westminster Seminary of the Presbyterians, attended the church as a child.\n The church and manse / parsonage in the rear (at 502 Cathedral Street, at southwest corner with West Hamilton Street [alley]) were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 5, 1971.
