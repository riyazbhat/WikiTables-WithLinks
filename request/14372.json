Named after the nearby Pripyat River, the city was founded on February 4, 1970, as the ninth nuclear city (a type of closed city) in the Soviet Union, to serve the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It was officially proclaimed a city in 1979 and had grown to a population of 49,360 by the time it was evacuated on the afternoon of April 27, 1986, the day after the Chernobyl disaster.\n Although Pripyat is located within the administrative district of Ivankiv Raion, the abandoned municipality now has the status of city of oblast significance within the larger Kiev Oblast (province) and is administered directly from Kiev. Pripyat is also supervised by Ukraine's Ministry of Emergencies, which manages activities for the entire Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.",
  "/wiki/RBMK": "The RBMK (Russian: \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u0420\u0411\u041c\u041a; reaktor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalnyy, \"high-power channel-type reactor\") is a class of graphite-moderated nuclear power reactor designed and built by the Soviet Union. The name refers to its unusual design where, instead of a large steel pressure vessel surrounding the entire core, each fuel assembly is enclosed in an individual 8\u00a0cm diameter pipe (called a \"channel\") which allows the flow of cooling water around the fuel.\n The RBMK is an early Generation II reactor and the oldest commercial reactor design still in wide operation. Certain aspects of the RBMK reactor design, such as the active removal of decay heat, the positive void coefficient properties, the 4.5\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) graphite displacer ends of the control rods and instability at low power levels, contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, in which an RBMK experienced a very large reactivity excursion, leading to a steam and hydrogen explosion, a large fire and subsequent meltdown. Radioactivity was released over a large portion of Europe. The disaster prompted worldwide calls for the reactors to be completely decommissioned; however, there is still considerable reliance on RBMK facilities for power in Russia. Most of the flaws in the design of RBMK-1000 reactors were corrected after the Chernobyl accident and a dozen reactors have since been operating without any serious incidents for over twenty years. While nine RBMK blocks under construction were cancelled after the Chernobyl disaster, and the last of three remaining RBMK blocks at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in 2000, as of 2019 there were still 10 RBMK reactors and three small EGP-6 graphite moderated light-water reactors operating in Russia, though all have been retrofitted with a number of safety updates. Only two RBMK blocks were started after 1986: Ignalina-2 and Smolensk-3.\n The only differences between RBMK-1000 and RBMK-1500 reactors are that the RBMK-1500 is cooled with less water (thus more of the water turns into steam), and it uses less uranium. The only reactors of this type and power output are the ones at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The RBMKP-2400 is rectangular instead of cylindrical, and it was intended to be made in sections at a factory for assembly in situ. It was designed to have a power output of 2400 MWe. No reactor with this power output has ever been built, with the most powerful one currently being as of 2018 the 1750 MWe EPR.",
  "/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant": "The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (officially, the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant) is a closed nuclear power plant near the abandoned city of Pripyat in northern Ukraine, 14.5 kilometers (9\u00a0mi) northwest of the city of Chernobyl, 16 kilometers (10\u00a0mi) from the Belarus\u2013Ukraine border, and about 110 kilometers (68\u00a0mi) north of Kiev.\n Reactor No. 4 was the site of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, and the power plant is now within a large restricted area known as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Both the zone and the former power plant are administered by the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management. The three other reactors remained operational after the accident but were eventually shut down by 2000, although the plant remains in the process of decommissioning as of 2020. Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065.",
  "/wiki/Chernobyl_accident": "The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No.\u00a04 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven\u2014the maximum severity\u2014on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.\n The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union. The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back-up generators could provide power \u2013 there is a time gap between the moment of power outage and the moment at which the back-up generators reach full power. This operating gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, the test was delayed by 10 hours, so an unprepared operating shift had to perform it. During a gradual decrease of reactor power that was done in preparation for the test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level at one moment. The operators were able to partially restore power, but this put the reactor in a highly unstable condition. The risks were not made evident in the operating instructions, despite a similar accident occurring years before, and the test proceeded even though the power was still lower than prescribed. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead.:33\n A large amount of energy was suddenly released, vapourising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and western Europe, before being finally contained on 4 May 1986. The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion. \nAs a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a 10-kilometre (6.2\u00a0mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. About 49,000\u00a0people were evacuated from the area, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) radius when a further 68,000\u00a0people were evacuated from the wider area.\n The reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. In the emergency response that followed, 134\u00a0firemen and station staff were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. Of these 134 people, 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10\u00a0years. Among the wider population, an excess of 15\u00a0childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011[update]. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has, at multiple times, reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. Determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no-threshold model, a contested statistical model, which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. Model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from Chernobyl releases vary, from 4,000\u00a0fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former Soviet states, to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of Europe.\n To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering, the protective Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which continued operating. Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, it was further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive hazard. Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065. The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. The initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000\u00a0personnel and cost an estimated 18\u00a0billion Soviet rubles\u2014roughly US$68\u00a0billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. The accident resulted in safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed RBMK reactors, of which 10 continue to be operational as of 2019[update].",

The idea of a reactor was proposed at the Kurchatov Institute by Savely Moiseevich Feinberg. VVER were originally developed before the 1970s, and have been continually updated. As a result, the name VVER is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from generation I reactors to modern generation III+ designs.\nPower output ranges from 70 to 1300 MWe, with designs of up to 1700 MWe in development. The first prototype VVER-210 was built at the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.\n VVER power stations have been mostly installed in Russia and the former Soviet Union, but also in China, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, India, and Iran.
