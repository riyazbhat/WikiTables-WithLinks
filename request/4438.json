Pala had previously served as parliamentary clerk, but resigned that position to stand (successfully) for Parliament in the 2007 general election.

Pala added that locals should be assisted in setting up their own businesses: there was a need to support our education system, to create some of the basics of how to make money, how to run a business and how to understand the commercial and business system in the schools.",
