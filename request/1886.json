After Shakespeare, Pope is the second-most quoted writer in the English language, as per The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., Damning with faint praise). He is considered a master of the heroic couplet. Pope's poetic career testifies to his indomitable spirit in the face of disadvantages, of health and of circumstance. The poet and his family were Catholics and thus fell subject to the Test Acts, prohibitive measures which severely hampered the prosperity of their co-religionists after the abdication of James II; one of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, and another from attending public school or university. For this reason, except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a lover of books.",

In the early decades of the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw, J. M. Synge, No\u00ebl Coward and J. B. Priestley. Since the First World War, the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has accordingly specialised in hosting musicals. The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.

Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such \"examples of neoclassical perfection\" as Ph\u00e8dre, Andromaque, and Athalie. He did write one comedy, Les Plaideurs, and a muted tragedy,  Esther for the young.\n Racine's plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic (12 syllable) French alexandrine. His writing is renowned for its elegance, purity, speed, and fury, and for what American poet Robert Lowell described as a \"diamond-edge\", and the \"glory of its hard, electric rage\". Racine's dramaturgy is marked by his psychological insight, the prevailing passion of his characters, and the nakedness[clarification needed] of both plot and stage.\n The linguistic effects of Racine's poetry are widely considered to be untranslatable, although many eminent poets have attempted to translate Racine's work into English, including Lowell, Richard Wilbur, Ted Hughes, Tony Harrison, and Derek Mahon, and Friedrich Schiller into German.\n The latest translations of Racine's plays into English have been by Alan Hollinghurst (Berenice, Bajazet), by RADA director Edward Kemp (Andromache), Neil Bartlett, and poet Geoffrey Alan Argent, who earned a 2011 American Book Award for the translating The Complete Plays of Jean Racine.",

The work, which Handel composed in 1738, includes the famous \"Dead March\", a funeral anthem for Saul and his son Jonathan, and some of the composer's most dramatic choral pieces. Saul was first performed at the King's Theatre in London on 16 January 1739.\nThe work was a success at its London premiere and was revived by Handel in subsequent seasons.

Handel started it soon after the opera season at King's Theatre was cancelled for lack of subscribers. The oratorio was not well received by the first audience though commended in the Daily Post; the second performance was shortened, the mainly choral work now augmented with Italian-style arias.\n The first version of the piece is in three parts rather than two, the first part more famous as \"The ways of Zion do mourn\", with altered text as \"The sons of Israel do mourn\" lamenting the death of Joseph.

He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his epic poem Paradise Lost (1667), written in blank verse, widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written. \n Writing in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated Areopagitica (1644), written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n William Hayley's 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\", and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\", though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his republicanism). Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a Tory and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".

It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere nearly a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music. Handel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ.

The work fuses elements of opera, oratorio and classical drama. Semele was presented during Lent, one of Handel's regular oratorio seasons.

The Occasional Oratorio is unique among Handel's works which he labelled \"oratorio\" in that it does not tell a story or contain elements of a drama, but was intended as a defiant and patriotic rallying piece. The Stuart armies, based in Scotland, had invaded England and got as far as Derby when the King's armies under the command of the King's son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland had driven them back to Scotland in December 1745. The fighting was at a hiatus due to winter weather and the Duke of Cumberland was in London in February 1746. Handel composed the Occasional Oratorio hastily in January and February 1746, \"borrowing\" and re-arranging some movements from previous compositions, and premiered it immediately on 14 February 1746 with Willem de Fesch, \u00c9lisabeth Duparc, Elisabetta de Gambarini, John Beard (tenor), and Thomas Reinhold at Covent Garden Theatre.

The work also includes a love story elaborated from a few hints in the Biblical narrative between Achsah, Caleb's daughter and Othniel, a young soldier. Joshua was the fourth oratorio Handel had written within the span of twenty months. Following the Jacobite rising of 1745 in England, Handel produced a series of English oratorios based on military themes: Occasional Oratorio, Judas Maccabaeus, Alexander Balus, Joshua, and Solomon.",
  "/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_George_Frideric_Handel": "George Frideric Handel (23 February 1685 \u2013 14 April 1759) was a German\u2013English Baroque composer who is famous for his operas, oratorios, organ concertos and concerti grossi. Handel's compositions include 42 operas; 25 oratorios; more than 120 cantatas, trios and duets; numerous arias; chamber music; a large number of ecclesiastical pieces; odes and serenatas; 18 concerti grossi; and 12 organ concertos. His oratorio Messiah, with its \"Hallelujah\" chorus, is among the most famous Baroque works and is a popular choice for performances during the Christmas season. Among Handel's best-known instrumental works are the Concerti grossi Opus 3 and Opus 6 and the Organ concertos Opus 4 and Opus 7; \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\", in which birds are heard calling during passages played in different keys representing the vocal ranges of two birds; and his 16 keyboard suites, especially The Harmonious Blacksmith.[citation needed]\n Collected editions of Handel's works include the H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft (HG) and the Hallische H\u00e4ndel-Ausgabe (HHA), however the more recent H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis (HWV) publication is now commonly used to number his works. For example, Handel's Messiah can be referred to as: HG xlv, HHA i/17, or HWV 56. Some of Handel's music is also numbered based on initial publications, for example a 1741 publication by Walsh labelled twelve of Handel's concerti grossi as Opus 6."
