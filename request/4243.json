  "/wiki/Lake_Pukaki": "Lake Pukaki is the largest of three roughly parallel alpine lakes running north\u2013south along the northern edge of the Mackenzie Basin on New Zealand's South Island.

  "/wiki/Christchurch": "Christchurch (/\u02c8kra\u026ast\u0283\u025c\u02d0rt\u0283/; M\u0101ori: \u014ctautahi) is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand and the seat of the Canterbury Region.

The Avon River flows through the centre of the city, with an urban park located along its banks. Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250. Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand. The Canterbury Association, which settled the Canterbury Plains, named the city after Christ Church, Oxford. The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area, except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south.",

Though Leithfield has the second largest and second fastest growing population (2385 at the 2006 census) in the Hurunui District, its regional importance is behind that of Amberley with its wine industry and the tourist centre of Hanmer Springs.

Despite this proximity, the Leithfield community supports a school, library, summer swimming pool, and many small businesses.",

  "/wiki/Waimakariri_River": "The Waimakariri River, formerly briefly known as the Courtenay River, is one of the largest of the North Canterbury rivers, in the South Island of New Zealand.

The river rises on the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps, eight kilometres southwest of Arthur's Pass. For much of its upper reaches, the river is braided, with wide shingle beds. As the river approaches the Canterbury Plains, it passes through a belt of mountains, and is forced into a narrow canyon (the Waimakariri Gorge), before reverting to its braided form for its passage across the plains. It enters the Pacific north of Christchurch, near the town of Kaiapoi.",

Several Department of Conservation tramping huts in the region make it a common destination for overnight trips; however, the area's comparatively remote location and difficult vehicle access mean it is seldom crowded."
