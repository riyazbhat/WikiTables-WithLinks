  "/wiki/Stuart_Davenport": "Stuart Davenport (born 21 September 1962 in Auckland, New Zealand) is a former professional squash player from New Zealand. He reached the World No. 3 ranking in 1987. Davenport learned to play squash in Christchurch, and was an outstanding junior (particularly after a growth spurt aided the physical side of his game after the age of 15). Coached by the legendary Dardir El Bakary, Davenport developed an excellent attacking game with the full array of volleys and attacking strokeplay. In 1980 he led the New Zealand Junior team to third place at the World Junior Championship in Sweden (after finishing third himself in the individual event). That same year he won the British under-19 title, and in 1982 took out the British under-23 championships. A distinguished senior professional career followed, highlights of which included finishing third in the World Individual Championships held in New Zealand in 1983, and several outstanding efforts for New Zealand in World Teams Championships events.",
  "/wiki/Chris_Dittmar": "Chris Dittmar (born 16 January 1964 in Adelaide, South Australia) is an Australian sports commentator who was formerly the World No. 1-ranked men's squash player. Dittmar is widely considered to be the best player never to have won one of squash's two biggest titles. He finished runner-up at the World Open five times \u2013 in 1983, 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1992 \u2013 and was runner-up at the British Open twice \u2013 in 1985 and 1993. Dittmar was perhaps unlucky to have been around during the same era as two great Pakistani players \u2013 Jahangir Khan and Jansher Khan. Dittmar provided probably the most consistent challenge of any player to the dominance of these two greats during the 1980s and early-1990s, but never quite managed to break their iron grip on the game. In all seven of the World Open and British Open finals he played in, Dittmar lost to one of the two Khans. There were several occasions in his career when Dittmar managed to beat one of the Khans in a semi-final round, only to lose to the other in the final.",

When he reached the World No. 2 ranking behind Jansher in November 1994, many observers felt he seemed a strong candidate to displace the aging Pakistani champion as World No. 1. However, in 1995, Marshall was afflicted with glandular fever, the effects of which meant he was unable to play top-level squash for two years. Marshall returned to the professional tour in 1997, re-claiming his place in the England squad which went on to win the World Team Squash Championships title in Malaysia.
