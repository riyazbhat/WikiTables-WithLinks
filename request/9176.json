  "/wiki/Babas\u00f3nicos": "Babas\u00f3nicos is an Argentine rock band, formed in the early 1990s along with others such as Peligrosos Gorriones and Los Brujos. After emerging in the wave of Argentine New Rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Babasonicos became one of the banner groups of the \"sonic\" underground rock movement in Argentina in the late 1990s.\n The band name refers partly to Sai Baba, the Indian guru, and partly to The Jetsons, whose Spanish version is called Los Supers\u00f3nicos.\n The lead singer Adri\u00e1n \"D\u00e1rgelos\" Rodr\u00edguez and the keyboardist Diego \"Uma-T\" Tu\u00f1\u00f3n initially decided to create a new wave style, which wouldn't follow the established Argentine music. The other official band members are: Diego \"Uma\" Rodr\u00edguez (guitarist and lead singer), Diego \"Panza\" Castellano (drummer), Mariano \"Roger\" Dom\u00ednguez (guitarist), and recently deceased Gabriel \"Gabo\" Manelli (bassist).\n For their second album, Trance Zomba (1994), they incorporated a guest DJ, \"DJ Peggyn\" who would eventually remain as a band member until after releasing Miami (1999). This same year the band saw the departure of their longtime manager Cosme.\n In 1999, they collaborated with Ian Brown on a song that bears their name on his album Golden Greats.\n Although the band has never been afraid to experiment with various diverse styles throughout their career, since they recorded Jessico (2001) their songs have become simpler and more in tune with current trends in music. Some believe this to be a contradiction with their original tenets, and that Babasonicos has turned into a mainstream marketable band.\n Their following records, Infame (2003), Anoche (2005), Mucho (2008), and \"A Prop\u00f3sito\" (2011) are proof that they have reached a broader audience.\n Babasonicos also composed the soundtrack for Vera Fogwill's movie Las Mantenidas Sin Sue\u00f1os (Kept and Dreamless), which was released in 2007. The album was composed in 2003.\n On January 12, 2008, the band posted an entry on their official site in which they informed that their longtime bassist, Gabriel Manelli had died as a result of Hodgkin's disease, which he had been suffering since the tour supporting the album Infame.\n Their album Mucho, was released in 2008, and was a more straightforward rock album than their predecessors. Phil Brown (Bob Marley, Robert Palmer, Talk Talk, Roxy Music) worked with Babasonicos just like he did in their previous album, Anoche. It is unknown who will be their new bassist, but in the meantime, their long-time friend Carca is playing with them.\n They released their album \"A Prop\u00f3sito\", in 2011.\n They release their latest album \"Discutible\", in 2018.",
