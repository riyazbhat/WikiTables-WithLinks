To date, Bujold has never revisited the settings of Athos or Kline Station in her many subsequent novels, but the events of Ethan of Athos are later referred to indirectly in the novels Borders of Infinity (1989) and Cetaganda (1995). Bujold had written her first novel Shards of Honor and its sequel The Warrior's Apprentice \u2014 both unpublished \u2014 when she wrote Ethan of Athos, a standalone work that was purposely short because the current cargo-cult rumor amongst the wanna-be-published back then was that editors would be more likely to read a short manuscript.

Bujold named Athos, a planet founded and maintained as an exclusively male-populated colony with a planetary religion and ideology supporting this single-sex structure, after the Greek Mount Athos, which has prohibited the entry of women for religious reasons since even before the ban was officially proclaimed by the Byzantine emperor Constantine Monomachos in 1046.
