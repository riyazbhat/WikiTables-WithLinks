A full postcode is known as a postcode unit and designates an area with a number of addresses or a single major delivery point. The structure of a postcode is two alphanumeric codes, the first having between two and four characters and the second, three characters. First, one or two letters indicate the postcode area, followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area. This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district, and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street. Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city (such as B for Birmingham) but may also be geographic in nature (such as HS for Outer Hebrides). Each postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one (or more) postcode districts.",

  "/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Sefton": "The Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in Merseyside, England, was formed on 1 April 1974 by the amalgamation of the county boroughs of Bootle and Southport, the municipal borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Formby and Litherland, and part of West Lancashire Rural District within the new county of Merseyside. The borough consists of a coastal strip of land on the Irish Sea which extends from Southport in the north to Bootle in the south, and an inland part to Maghull in the south-east. The district is bounded by the city of Liverpool to the south, the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley to the south-east, and West Lancashire to the east.\n It is named after the village and parish of Sefton, near Maghull. When the borough was created in the Local Government Act 1972, a name was sought that would not unduly identify the borough with any of its constituent parts, particularly the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport. The locality had strong links with both the Earl of Sefton and the Earl of Derby, resident of Knowsley Hall, and given the fact that the immediately adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley it seems equally likely that the choice of name was derived from the names of the local nobility. A Sefton Rural District covering some of the villages in the district existed from 1894 to 1932.",

  "/wiki/Marshside,_Sefton": "Marshside is a suburb of the town of Southport, Merseyside, England. It is part of the ancient parish of North Meols and was formerly a detached settlement, on the northern fringe of what is now Southport.
