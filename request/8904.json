Further south, the valley extends into the Tamar Valley, a popular hiking destination in Triglav National Park.\n Planica is famous for ski jumping. The first ski jumping hill was constructed before 1930 at the slope of Mount Ponca. In 1933, Ivan Ro\u017eman constructed a larger hill, known as the \"Bloudek Giant\" after Stanko Bloudek, which later gave rise to ski flying. The first ski jump over 100 m was achieved here in 1936 by the Austrian Sepp Bradl. At the time, this was the biggest jumping hill in the world, sometimes called \"the mother of all jumping hills.\"[citation needed]\n In 1969, a new K-185 hill, the Letalnica bratov Gori\u0161ek was built by Vlado and Janez Gori\u0161ek.",
