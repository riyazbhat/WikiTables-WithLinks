The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's white minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led Olympic boycott created in the women's hockey competition. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the round-robin tournament with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge upset, particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an irresistible fairy story. Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour. The 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name\u2014barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as Rhodesia in 1964. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on artificial turf, which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating Poland and the USSR and drawing with Czechoslovakia and India, the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4\u20131 victory over Austria. Dubbed the Golden Girls by the media of Zimbabwe, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities.",
