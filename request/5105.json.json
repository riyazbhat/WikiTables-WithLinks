Agassiz grew up in Switzerland. He received doctor of philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich, respectively. After studying with Cuvier and Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel. He emigrated to the United States in 1847 after visiting Harvard University. He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, to head its Lawrence Scientific School, and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology.",
  "/wiki/Ice_age": "An ice age is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Earth's climate alternates between ice ages and greenhouse periods, during which there are no glaciers on the planet. Earth is currently in the Quaternary glaciation, known in popular terminology as the Ice Age. Individual pulses of cold climate within an ice age are termed \"glacial periods\" (or, alternatively, \"glacials\", \"glaciations\", \"glacial stages\", \"stadials\", \"stades\", or colloquially, \"ice ages\"), and intermittent warm periods within an ice age are called \"interglacials\" or \"interstadials\", with both climatic pulses part of the Quaternary or other periods in Earth's history.",

  "/wiki/Louis_Lliboutry": "Louis Lliboutry (born 19 February 1922 in Madrid; died on 21 October 2007 in Grenoble) was a French glaciologist, geophysicist, and mountaineer. While in Chile in the early 1950s, he analysed and explained the formation of snow penitents in the Andes, which marked his first contribution to glaciology. He founded in Grenoble in 1958 the Laboratory of Alpine Glaciology and headed it for 25 years; he also set up at that period a pioneering syllabus in geophysics. His contributions to mechanics of viscous media (such as ice and the Earth's mantle) and to geodynamics are internationally acknowledged.",
  "/wiki/Penitente_(snow_formation)": "Penitentes, or nieves penitentes (Spanish for \"penitent-shaped snows\"), are snow formations found at high altitudes. They take the form of elongated, thin blades of hardened snow or ice, closely spaced and pointing towards the general direction of the sun.",

Meier was the Director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) from 1985 to 1994 and remained the institute's director emeritus until his death in 2012.

  "/wiki/Glacier_motion": "Glacial motion is the motion of glaciers, which can be likened to rivers of ice. It has played an important role in sculpting many landscapes. Most lakes in the world occupy basins scoured out by glaciers. Glacial motion can be fast (up to 30 m/day, observed on Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6 in Greenland) or slow (0.5 m/year on small glaciers or in the center of ice sheets), but is typically around 25 cm/day.",

  "/wiki/Storglaci%C3%A4ren": "Storglaci\u00e4ren (Swedish for The Grand Glacier) is a glacier in Tarfala Valley in the Scandinavian Alps of Kiruna Municipality, Sweden. The glacier is classified as polythermal having both cold and warm bottom temperatures. It was on Storglaci\u00e4ren that the first glacier mass balance research program began (immediately after World War II), which continues to the present day; this is the longest continuous study of its type in the world. Storglaci\u00e4ren has had a cumulative negative mass balance of -17 m between 1946\u20132006. The program began monitoring the Rabots Glaci\u00e4r in 1982, Riukojietna in 1985, and M\u00e5rmaglaci\u00e4ren in 1988. All three of these glaciers have had a strong negative mass balance since monitoring began.",
