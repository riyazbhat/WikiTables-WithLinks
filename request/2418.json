  "/wiki/Cyrano_de_Bergerac_(1990_film)": "Cyrano de Bergerac is a 1990 French comedy-drama film directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau and based on the 1897 play of the same name by Edmond Rostand, adapted by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and Rappeneau. It stars G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Anne Brochet and Vincent P\u00e9rez. The film was a co-production between companies in France and Hungary. The film is the first theatrical film version of Rostand's original play in colour, and the second theatrical film version of the play in the original French. It is also considerably more lavish and more faithful to the original than previous film versions of the play. The film had 4,732,136 admissions in France. Subtitles are used for the non-French market; the English-language version uses Anthony Burgess's translation of the text, which uses five-beat lines with a varying number of syllables and a regular couplet rhyming scheme, in other words, a sprung rhythm. Although he sustains the five-beat rhythm through most of the play, Burgess sometimes allows this structure to break deliberately: in Act V, he allows it collapse completely, creating a free verse. In 2010, Cyrano de Bergerac was ranked number 43 in Empire magazine's The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema.",
