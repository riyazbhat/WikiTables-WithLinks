Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards, it has suffered in more recent years from being blurred, as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience, market segment, community, constituency, and stakeholder. The name \"public\" originates with the Latin publicus (also poplicus), from populus,  to the English word 'populace', and in general denotes some mass population (\"the people\") in association with some matter of common interest.
