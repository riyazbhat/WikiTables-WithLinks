  "/wiki/License": "A license (American English) or licence (British English) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit). A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is an authorization to use licensed material. In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations. A licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a patented invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor. Term: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement. Territory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to.",

JCR) content repository such as Apache Jackrabbit. Apache Sling allows developers to deploy their application components as OSGi bundles or as scripts and templates in the content repository. Supported scripting languages are JSP, server-side JavaScript, Ruby, Velocity. The goal of Apache Sling is to expose content in the content repository as HTTP resources, fostering a RESTful style of application architecture. Sling is different from many other Web application frameworks in the\nsense that it truly focuses on the web aspect of the web application development and \nthrough its development paradigm suggests an intuitive RESTful \ndevelopment of a true web application. Other frameworks focus more on the application development and therefore are ideal extensions to Sling. The Sling project was started on August 27, 2007, when Day Software proposed to donate the source base of its internal web framework powering the Day Communiqu\u00e9 WCM to the Apache Software Foundation. The project was accepted to the Apache Incubator with Apache Jackrabbit being the sponsoring project. On June 18, 2009 the project graduated as Apache top-level project.",

In December 2005, it was announced that WebWork 2.2 was adopted as Apache Struts 2, which reached its first full release in February 2007. Struts 2 has a history of critical security bugs, many tied to its use of OGNL technology; some vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution. In October 2017, it was reported that failure by Equifax to address a Struts 2 vulnerability advised in March 2017 was later exploited in the data breach that was disclosed by Equifax in September 2017.",

AppFuse provides a project skeleton, similar to the one that's created by an IDE when one clicks through a new web project wizard. AppFuse 1.x uses Ant to create the project, as well as build/test/deploy it, whereas AppFuse 2.x uses Maven 2 for these tasks. IDE support was improved in 2.0 by leveraging Maven plugins to generate IDE project files. AppFuse 1.x uses XDoclet and JDK 1.4+. Unlike other new project wizards, the AppFuse wizard creates a number of additional classes and files that implement features, but also serve as examples for the developer. The project is pre-configured to talk to a database, to deploy in an appserver, and to allow logging in. When AppFuse was first developed, it only supported Struts and Hibernate. In version 2.x, it supports Hibernate, iBATIS or JPA as persistence frameworks. For implementing the MVC model, AppFuse is compatible with JSF, Spring MVC, Struts 2 or Tapestry.",

The modified BSD license (in wide use today) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix.

The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own (even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components. However, any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications. The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License.

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman, former head of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms. This is in distinction to permissive software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community. In 2007, the third version of the license (GPLv3) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version (GPLv2) which were discovered during the latter's long-time usage. To keep the license up to date, the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause, allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF. Developers can omit it when licensing their software; the Linux kernel, for instance, is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause.",

  "/wiki/JWt_(Java_web_toolkit)": "JWt (pronounced jay-witty) is an open-source widget-centric web application framework for the Java programming language developed by Emweb. It has an API that uses established GUI application development patterns. The programming model is component-based and event-driven, similar to Swing. The goal of the library is to benefit from the stateful component model used in desktop applications APIs, applied to web development, instead of the traditional model-view-controller (MVC) model. Rather than using MVC at the level of a page, MVC is pushed to the level of individual components. While the library uses a desktop application development model, it does support web-specific features including semantic URLs, browser history navigation support, internationalization, themes and styling, . A unique feature of the library is its abstraction layer of the browser rendering model. The library uses Ajax for communicating with Ajax-capable browsers, while using plain HTML form post-backs for other user agents (for accessibility and search engines). Using a progressive bootstrap method, the user interface is initially rendered as plain HTML, and for Ajax-capable browsers, it is automatically upgraded to use Ajax for increased interactivity. In this way, it is the only server-side framework that implements progressive enhancement automatically, and the only Ajax framework with search engine optimization (SEO) qualities. [citation needed]\n JWt is distributed as a jar file. A JWt application is a war file that is deployed in a standards-compliant servlet container."
