  "/wiki/Intersectionality": "Intersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding how aspects of one's social and political identities (e.g., gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, etc.) might combine to create unique modes of discrimination. It aims to broaden the agenda of the first waves of feminism, which largely focused on the experiences of white, middle class women. The broad agenda means that intersectionality is used to find combinations of injustices that are felt by members of society. For example, a black woman might face discrimination from a company that is not distinctly due to her race (because the company does not discriminate against black men) nor her gender (because the company does not discriminate against white women), but by a unique combination of the two. Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from white feminism by acknowledging the fact that all women have different experiences and identities. It is a qualitative analytic framework that identifies how interlocking systems of power affect those who are most marginalized in society.[verification needed] The term was coined by black feminist scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw in 1989. There are various forms of social stratification such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, ability, and gender, which are included in the consideration of intersectional feminism and its social and cultural effects. The purpose of intersectionality as a theory is to identify how overlapping categories of identity impact individuals and institutions, and take these relationships into account when working to promote social and political equity. It ensures that feminism considers not only gender, but also combinations of various types of oppression that result in people\u2019s experiences of injustice. While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society, today the analysis has expanded to include many more aspects of social identity. Race and gender bias are two separate issues; however, they can be combined to create even more harm. Intersectionality is used to describe this phenomenon of being impacted and oppressed by multiple sources, but only treated for one. Intersectionality may also be related to the term triple oppression, which engages with similar themes.   \n Intersectionality has been critiqued as being inherently ambiguous. The ambiguity of this theory means that it can be perceived as unorganized and lacking a clear set of defining goals; this arguably means that intersectionality will be unlikely to achieve equality due to its unfocused agenda. Without a clear focus, it is difficult for a movement to create change because having such a broad theory makes it harder for people to fully understand its goals. As it is based in standpoint theory, critics say the focus on subjective experiences can lead to contradictions and the inability to identify common causes of oppression.",

  "/wiki/Bruno_Latour": "Bruno Latour (/l\u0259\u02c8t\u028a\u0259r/; French: [latu\u0281]; born 22 June 1947) is a French philosopher, anthropologist and sociologist. He is especially known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS). After teaching at the \u00c9cole des Mines de Paris (Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at Sciences Po Paris (2006\u20132017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017. He was also a Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics.\n Latour is best known for his books We Have Never Been Modern (1991; English translation, 1993), Laboratory Life (with Steve Woolgar, 1979) and Science in Action (1987). Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with social constructionist approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour has diverged significantly from such approaches. He is best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice. Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.\nAlong with Michel Callon and John Law, Latour is one of the primary developers of actor\u2013network theory (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel, the generative semiotics of Algirdas Julien Greimas, and (more recently) the sociology of \u00c9mile Durkheim's rival Gabriel Tarde.\n Latour's monographs earned him a 10th place among most-cited book authors in the humanities and social sciences for the year 2007.",

  "/wiki/Modernity": "Modernity, a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the modern era), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the Renaissance\u2014in the \"Age of Reason\" of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century \"Enlightenment\". Some commentators consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with World War II in 1945, or the 1980s or 1990s; the following era is called postmodernity. The term \"contemporary history\" is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era.  (Thus \"modern\" may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning \"the current era\".)\n Depending on the field, \"modernity\" may refer to different time periods or qualities.  In historiography, the 17th and 18th centuries are usually described as early modern, while the long 19th century corresponds to \"modern history\" proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics (Berman 2010, 15\u201336).\n As an analytical concept and normative ideal, modernity is closely linked to the ethos of philosophical and aesthetic modernism; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as existentialism, modern art, the formal establishment of social science, and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as Marxism.  It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularisation and post-industrial life (Berman 2010, 15\u201336).\n By the late 19th and 20th centuries, modernist art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the West and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political progress. Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development. Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by postmodernism while the dominance of Western Europe and Anglo-America over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory.\n In the view of Michel Foucault (1975) (classified as a proponent of postmodernism though he himself rejected the \"postmodernism\" label, considering his work as \"a critical history of modernity\"\u2014see, e.g., Call 2002, 65), \"modernity\" as a historical category is marked by developments such as a questioning or rejection of tradition; the prioritization of individualism, freedom and formal equality; faith in inevitable social, scientific and technological progress, rationalization and professionalization, a movement from feudalism (or agrarianism) toward capitalism and the market economy, industrialization, urbanization and secularisation, the development of the nation-state, representative democracy, public education (etc.) (Foucault 1977, 170\u201377).\n In the context of art history, \"modernity\" (modernit\u00e9) has a more limited sense, \"modern art\" covering the period of c. 1860\u20131970. Use of the term in this sense is  attributed to Charles Baudelaire, who in his 1864 essay \"The Painter of Modern Life\", designated the \"fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis\", and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. In this sense, the term refers to \"a particular relationship to time, one characterized by intense historical discontinuity or rupture, openness to the novelty of the future, and a heightened sensitivity to what is unique about the present\" (Kompridis 2006, 32\u201359).",

  "/wiki/Wahhabi_movement": "Wahhabism (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629\u200e, al-Wahh\u0101biya(h)) is an Islamic doctrine and religious movement founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.[a] It has been variously described as \"ultraconservative\", \"far-right\" \"austere\", \n\"fundamentalist\", \nor \"puritan (ical)\"; as an Islamic \"reform movement\"  to restore \"pure monotheistic worship\" (tawhid) by devotees; and as a \"deviant sectarian movement\", \"vile sect\" and a distortion of Islam by its detractors. \nThe term Wahhabi(sm) is often used polemically and adherents commonly reject its use, preferring to be called Salafi or muwahhid, claiming to emphasize the principle of tawhid (the \"uniqueness\" and \"unity\" of God) or monotheism, dismissing other Muslims as practising shirk (idolatry). It follows the theology of Ibn Taymiyyah and the Hanbali school of jurisprudence, although Hanbali leaders renounced ibn Abd al-Wahhab's views.\n Wahhabism is named after an eighteenth-century preacher and activist, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703\u20131792). He started a reform movement in the remote, sparsely populated region of Najd, advocating a purging of such widespread Sunni practices as the veneration of saints and the visiting of their tombs and shrines, that were practiced all over the Islamic world, but which he considered idolatrous impurities and innovations in Islam (bid'ah). Eventually he formed a pact with a local leader, Muhammad bin Saud, offering political obedience and promising that protection and propagation of the Wahhabi movement meant \"power and glory\" and rule of \"lands and men\".\n The alliance between followers of ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad bin Saud's successors (the House of Saud) proved to be a durable one. The House of Saud continued to maintain its politico-religious alliance with the Wahhabi sect through the waxing and waning of its own political fortunes over the next 150 years, through to its eventual proclamation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and then afterwards, on into modern times. Today Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab's teachings are the official, state-sponsored form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia. With the help of funding from Saudi petroleum exports (and other factors), the movement underwent \"explosive growth\" beginning in the 1970s and now has worldwide influence. The US State Department has estimated that over the past four decades concerns in Riyadh have directed at least $10bn (\u00a36bn) to select charitable foundations toward the subversion of mainstream Sunni Islam by Wahhabism. (As of 2017 changes to Saudi religious policy by Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman have led some to suggest that \"Islamists throughout the world will have to follow suit or risk winding up on the wrong side of orthodoxy\".)\n The \"boundaries\" of Wahhabism have been called \"difficult to pinpoint\", but in contemporary usage, the terms Wahhabi and Salafi  are often used interchangeably, and they are considered to be movements with different roots that have merged since the 1960s. However, Wahhabism has also been called \"a particular orientation within Salafism\", or an ultra-conservative, Saudi brand of Salafism. Estimates of the number of adherents to Wahhabism vary, with one source (Mehrdad Izady) giving a figure of fewer than 5 million Wahhabis in the Persian Gulf region (compared to 28.5 million Sunnis and 89 million Shia).\n The majority of Sunni and Shia Muslims worldwide disagree with the interpretation of Wahhabism, and many Muslims denounce them as a faction or a \"vile sect\". Islamic scholars, including those from the Al-Azhar University, regularly denounce Wahhabism with terms such as \"Satanic faith\". Wahhabism has been accused of being \"a source of global terrorism\", inspiring the ideology of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and for causing disunity in Muslim communities by labelling Muslims who disagreed with the Wahhabi definition of monotheism as apostates (takfir) and justifying their killing. It has also been criticized for the destruction of historic shrines of saints, mausoleums, and other Muslim and non-Muslim buildings and artifacts.",
  "/wiki/Sharia": "Sharia (/\u0283\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0259/, Arabic: \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629\u200e [\u0283a\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0295ah]), Islamic law  or sharia law is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the hadith. In Arabic, the term shar\u012b\u02bfah refers to God's immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations. The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim fundamentalists and modernists.\n Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia: the Quran, sunnah (authentic hadith), qiyas (analogical reasoning),[note 1] and ijma (juridical consensus). Different legal schools\u2014of which the most prominent are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Jafari\u2014developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ijtihad. Traditional jurisprudence (fiqh) distinguishes two principal branches of law, \u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t (rituals) and mu\u02bf\u0101mal\u0101t (social relations), which together comprise a wide range of topics. Its rulings are concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms, assigning actions to one of five categories: mandatory, recommended, neutral, abhorred, and prohibited. Thus, some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with God\u2019s will.\n Classical jurisprudence was elaborated by private religious scholars, largely through legal opinions (fatwas) issued by qualified jurists (muftis). It was historically applied in sharia courts by ruler-appointed judges, who dealt mainly with civil disputes and community affairs. Sultanic courts, the police and market inspectors administered criminal justice, which was influenced by sharia but not bound by its rules. Non-Muslim (dhimmi) communities had legal autonomy to adjudicate their internal affairs. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, and fiqh was complemented by various economic, criminal and administrative laws issued by Muslim rulers. The Ottoman civil code of 1869\u20131876 was the first partial attempt to codify sharia.\n In the modern era, traditional laws in the Muslim world have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models. Judicial procedures and legal education were likewise brought in line with European practice. While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in personal status (family) laws. Legislators who codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence. The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought along calls by Islamist movements for full implementation of sharia, including hudud corporal punishments, such as stoning. In some cases, this resulted in traditionalist legal reform, while other countries witnessed juridical reinterpretation of sharia advocated by progressive reformers. Some Muslim-minority countries recognize the use of sharia-based family laws for their Muslim populations. Sharia also continues to influence other aspects of private and public life.\n The role of sharia has become a contested topic around the world. Introduction of sharia-based laws sparked intercommunal violence in Nigeria and may have contributed to the breakup of Sudan. Some jurisdictions in North America have passed bans on use of sharia, framed as restrictions on religious or foreign laws. There are ongoing debates as to whether sharia is compatible with democracy, human rights, freedom of thought, women's rights, LGBT rights, and banking.",

The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures.
