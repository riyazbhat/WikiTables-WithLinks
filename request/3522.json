  "/wiki/Community_radio": "Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting. Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest. They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local, specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters. Community radio stations are operated, owned, and influenced by the communities they serve. They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals, groups, and communities to tell their own stories, to share experiences and, in a media-rich world, to become creators and contributors of media. In many parts of the world, community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector, civil society, agencies, NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims, in addition to broadcasting. There is legally defined community radio (as a distinct broadcasting sector) in many countries, such as France, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and Ireland. Much of the legislation has included phrases such as \"social benefit\", \"social objectives\" and \"social gain\" as part of the definition.",

Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper, which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with paper and printing press, to Europe.",
  "/wiki/CBV-FM": "CBV-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts the programming of Radio-Canada's Premi\u00e8re network in Quebec City. The station broadcasts at 106.3 FM from Mount B\u00e9lair. The station was first launched in 1934 as AM 950 CRCK, Quebec City's second-oldest radio station. It was an affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, airing programming in both English and French. It became a part of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936. It adopted the callsign CBV in 1938, becoming the second station in Radio-Canada's French radio network. In 1941, CBV moved to 980 kHz. In 1974, CBVX-FM, broadcasting Radio-Canada's FM network, was launched.",
  "/wiki/Ici_Radio-Canada_Premi\u00e8re": "Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re (formerly Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene) is a Canadian French-language radio network, the news and information service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (known as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada in French), the public broadcaster of Canada. It is the French counterpart of CBC Radio One, the CBC's similar English-language radio network. The service is available across Canada, although not as widely as CBC Radio One. Only the provinces of Quebec and Ontario are served by more than one Premi\u00e8re originating station. In all other provinces, the whole province is served by a single station with multiple transmitters. The network does, however, reach 90 percent of all Canadian francophones. Each originating station outside Montreal airs a national schedule, taken from flagship station CBF-FM, complete with opted-out local/regional shows at peak times, depending on each market. News bulletins are aired live, irrespective of location.",
  "/wiki/CITF-FM": "CITF-FM is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Owned and operated by Bell Media, it broadcasts on 107.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 37,000 watts (class C1) using an omnidirectional antenna. The station's transmitter is located at Mount B\u00e9lair. The station has an adult contemporary format since 1990 and is part of the Rouge FM network which operates across Quebec and Eastern Ontario. CITF-FM started operations on July 22, 1982 as a sister station to the now-defunct CKCV 1280 with a beautiful music format. The latter closed in September 1990, as part of a failed attempt of Telemedia (then owner of both stations) to buy CHRC 800, as at the time owners were limited to only one AM station and one FM station per market. (Even though the purchase of CKCV was denied by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), that station remained dark.) Up until 1990, CITF-FM had a beautiful music format.",
  "/wiki/Rouge_FM": "Rouge FM is a network of French-language adult contemporary radio stations broadcasting throughout Quebec, Canada. Established in 1990 as RockD\u00e9tente, they are owned by Bell Media. All Rouge FM stations broadcast in the same markets as Bell's contemporary hit radio network, \u00c9nergie, although \u00c9nergie also has a few stations in markets not served by Rouge FM. Although the stations concentrate on French adult contemporary music, it would mix in English music as well, much like Cogeco's Rythme FM network, which has fewer stations than Rouge FM. The flagship radio station is Montreal's CITE-FM. The Astral jingles on this network are different from the adult hits jingles used by Astral's English-language adult contemporary stations, nut the network uses a very relaxing acoustic tune. On August 18, 2011, at 4:00 p.m. EDT, all RockD\u00e9tente stations were rebranded as Rouge FM, when the longtime RockD\u00e9tente branding was retired after a 21-year run. On most stations, the last song as RockD\u00e9tente was Pour que tu m'aimes encore by Celine Dion, followed by a tribute of the branding.",
  "/wiki/Soft_adult_contemporary": "In North American music, adult contemporary music (AC) is a form of radio-played popular music, ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day, with varying degrees of easy listening, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, quiet storm, and rock influence. Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music. Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse\u2013chorus structure. The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments (though bass guitar is usually used) such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers (and other electronics, such as drum machines).",
