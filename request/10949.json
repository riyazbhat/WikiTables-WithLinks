  "/wiki/Taro": "Colocasia esculenta is a tropical plant grown primarily for its edible corms, a root vegetable most commonly known as taro (/\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0ro\u028a, \u02c8t\u00e6ro\u028a/), or kalo in Hawaiian (see Names and etymology for an extensive list). It is the most widely cultivated species of several plants in the family Araceae which are used as vegetables for their corms, leaves, and petioles. Taro corms are a food staple in African, Oceanic and South Asian cultures (similar to yams), and taro is believed to have been one of the earliest cultivated plants."
