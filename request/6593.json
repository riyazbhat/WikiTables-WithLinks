  "/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence": "The Irish War of Independence (Irish: Cogadh na Saoirse) or Anglo-Irish War was a guerrilla war fought in Ireland from 1919 to 1921 between the Irish Republican Army (IRA, the army of the Irish Republic) and British forces: the British Army, along with the quasi-military Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and its paramilitary forces the Auxiliaries and Ulster Special Constabulary (USC). It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into warfare.",
  "/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army_(1917\u201322)": "The Irish Republican Army (IRA) (Irish: \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann) was an Irish republican revolutionary paramilitary organisation. The ancestor of many groups also known as the Irish Republican Army, and distinguished from them as the Old IRA, it was descended from the Irish Volunteers, an organisation established on 25 November 1913 that staged the Easter Rising in April 1916. In 1919, the Irish Republic that had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising was formally established by an elected assembly (D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann), and the Irish Volunteers were recognised by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as its legitimate army. Thereafter, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against the British occupation of Ireland in the 1919\u201321 Irish War of Independence.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Irish_uprisings": "This is a list of uprisings by Irish people against English and British claims of sovereignty in Ireland. These uprisings include attempted counter-revolutions and rebellions, though some can be described as either depending upon perspective. After the United Irishmen Rebellion such uprisings became more revolutionary and republican in nature. Following the War of Independence, the partition of Ireland and the creation of the autonomous Irish Free State in 26 of the island's 32 counties in 1922, most but not all subsequent insurgent activity occurred within the six counties of Northern Ireland, which was retained in the United Kingdom."
