  "/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire": "Reading (/\u02c8r\u025bd\u026a\u014b/ (listen) RED-ing) is a large, historic university and minster town in Berkshire, South East England. It is in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the River Thames and River Kennet, and on both the Great Western Main Line railway and the M4 motorway. Reading is 70 miles (110 km) east of Bristol, 24 miles (39 km) south of Oxford, 40 miles (64 km) west of London, 14 miles (23 km) north of Basingstoke, 12 miles (19 km) south-west of Maidenhead and 15 miles (24 km) east of Newbury.\n The first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the medieval period, as the site of Reading Abbey, one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.\n Today,[when?] Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills. Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the University of Reading. Every year it hosts the Reading Festival, one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include Reading Football Club, Reading City F.C. and London Irish rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the Reading Half Marathon.\n In 2018, Reading had a population of 230,046 and the wider urban area had 337,108 inhabitants, while the smaller unitary authority area covered by the Borough of Reading had 163,203 residents. The borough is represented in Parliament by two members, and has been continuously represented there since 1295.

Written history of the village is traced back at least as far as the 9th century CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles show that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard family by Henry I; the manor is documented in the Domesday survey. The village church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building's structure.\nThe last resident Lord of the Manor, Charles Keyser, died in 1929. The manor estate has been subsequently occupied by Associated Electrical Industries, the XIX Tactical Air Command, the Women's Land Army, Collier Macmillan Schools, Blue Circle Industries, and the Compass Group, who ran it as a hotel and corporate venue.

In the 16th century the name is recorded as Thingest and then Fingest.  Although the early name is the etymological root of both 'Tinghurst' and 'Fingest', the latter doesn't follow the former by any normal linguistic line.[citation needed]\n The ancient parish of Fingest included Cadmore End to the north of the village, which became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1852.\n The manor of Fingest anciently belonged to St Albans Abbey. In 1163 it was given to the bishop of Lincoln. The ghost of Henry Burghersh, 14th-century Bishop of Lincoln, is reputed to haunt the area. After this time it was used as the country residence for the Lincoln diocese until 1547 when it was seized by the Crown.  It was then given two years later to the Duke of Somerset who exchanged it with a property belonging to Wells Cathedral.  The manor is now privately owned.\n The civil parish of Fingest, originally based on the ecclesiastical parish, was enlarged in 1934 by adding land from the parishes of West Wycombe, Great Marlow and Hambleden.  As a result, Lane End became the largest settlement in the parish, and the parish was renamed Fingest and Lane End in 1937.  In the 1980s the civil parish was abolished.  The larger part became the parish of Lane End, and the village of Fingest was added to Hambleden parish.\n Scenes of the period drama The Monuments Men were shot in Fingest in May 2013, starring George Clooney, Matt Damon and Jean Dujardin.",
