It is the highest mountain in Siberia (Asian Russia). Its steep, symmetrical cone towers about 100 kilometres (60 mi) from the Bering Sea. The volcano is part of the natural Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO World Heritage Site. Klyuchevskaya appeared 6,000 years ago. Its first recorded eruption occurred in 1697, and it has been almost continuously active ever since, as have many of its neighboring volcanoes. It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition. No other ascents were recorded until 1931, when several climbers were killed by flying lava on the descent.",

Rossiya, IPA: [r\u0250\u02c8s\u02b2ij\u0259]), or the Russian Federation,[e] is a European country located in Eastern Europe with a vast expanse of territory that stretches across Northern Asia. At 17,125,200 square kilometres (6,612,100 sq mi), it is by far the largest country in the world by area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, spanning eleven time zones, and bordering 16 sovereign nations. The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south. With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country's 85 federal subjects as of 2020, Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world. Russia's capital and largest city is Moscow; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan and Chelyabinsk. The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century.",

At 3,607 metres (11,834 ft), it is the highest peak of the Sredinny Range, the central range of the peninsula. Ichinsky is also among the largest volcanoes in Kamchatka, with a volume of about 450 cubic kilometres (110 cu mi). The volcano is capped by a 3-by-5-kilometre (2 by 3 mi) summit caldera, within which rise two lava domes which are the highest peaks. The entire summit area is covered by a substantial ice cap, and several large glaciers descend the flanks of the cone. There is ongoing fumarolic activity within the caldera. A dozen more dacite and rhyodacite lava domes are found on the flanks of the volcano below the caldera rim. Basaltic and dacitic lava flows extand form the lower flanks, some as long as 10\u201315 kilometres (6\u20139 mi).",

It is the southernmost active volcano of Kamchatka. It has erupted mafic rocks. It has a summit crater as well as five cinder cones on its flanks which are the source of lava flows. The volcano probably formed during the early Holocene and aside from the summit crater also features an explosion crater on the southwestern side of the summit. Three large collapses of the edifice occurred around 6300 BP; between the first two volcanic activity restored the cone, while the third occurred on the ridge on which Kambalny was constructed. The longest of these landslides travelled 20 kilometres (12 mi). The total volume of these landslides, 5\u201310 cubic kilometres (1.2\u20132.4 cu mi), is the largest of all Holocene landslides, but it was buried at Kambalny proper by later volcanic activity.",
