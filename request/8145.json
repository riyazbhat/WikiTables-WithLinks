  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain.  Impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth.",
