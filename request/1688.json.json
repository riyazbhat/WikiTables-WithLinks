Compulsory figures were skated at the outdoor Jordal Amfi rink, while the free skating portions of the competition were held at the huge Bislett Stadion, on a regulation-sized ice surface set inside the speed skating track. The competition opened with the ladies' figures on February 16 and 17, followed by the men's figures on February 19 and then the three free skating events for ladies, men, and pairs. Somewhat unusually for competitions of this era, there were no particular problems with bad weather or poor ice conditions at the outdoor rinks.",
