  "/wiki/CDMA": "Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies. CDMA is an example of multiple access,  where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel. This allows several users to share a band of frequencies (see bandwidth). To permit this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code).\n CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards. IS-95, also called \"cdmaOne\", and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply referred to as \"CDMA\", but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers, also uses \"wideband CDMA\", or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA, as its radio technologies.",

  "/wiki/WiBro": "WiBro (wireless broadband) is a wireless broadband Internet technology developed by the South Korean telecoms industry. WiBro is the South Korean service name for IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX) international standard. By the end of 2012, the Korean Communications Commission intends to increase WiBro broadband connection speeds to 10Mbit/s, around ten times the 2009 speed, which will complement their 1Gbit/s fibre-optic network.  The WiBro networks were shut down at the end of 2018.\n WiBro adopts TDD for duplexing, OFDMA for multiple access and 8.75/10.00\u00a0MHz as a channel bandwidth. WiBro was devised to overcome the data rate limitation of mobile phones (for example CDMA 1x) and to add mobility to broadband Internet access (for example ADSL or Wireless LAN).  In February 2002, the Korean government allocated 100\u00a0MHz of electromagnetic spectrum in the 2.3\u20132.4\u00a0GHz band, and in late 2004 WiBro Phase 1 was standardized by the TTA of Korea and in late 2005 ITU reflected WiBro as IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX). Two South Korean telecom companies (KT, SKT) launched commercial service in June 2006, and the tariff is around US$30.\n WiBro base stations offer an aggregate data throughput of 30 to 50\u00a0Mbit/s per carrier and cover a radius of 1\u20135\u00a0km allowing for the use of portable internet usage. In detail, it provides mobility for moving devices up to 120\u00a0km/h (74.5\u00a0mi/h)  compared to Wireless LAN having mobility up to walking speed and mobile phone technologies having mobility up to 250\u00a0km/h. From testing during the APEC Summit in Busan in late 2005, the actual range and bandwidth were quite a bit lower than these numbers. The technology will also offer Quality of Service. The inclusion of QoS allows for WiBro to stream video content and other loss-sensitive data in a reliable manner. These all appear to be (and may be) the stronger advantages over the fixed WiMAX standard (802.16a). Some Telcos in many countries were trying to commercialize this Mobile WiMAX (or WiBro). For example, TI (Italy), TVA (Brazil), Omnivision (Venezuela), PORTUS (Croatia), and Arialink (Michigan) provided commercial service at some stage. While WiBro is quite precise in its requirements from spectrum use to equipment design, WiMAX leaves much of this up to the equipment provider while providing enough detail to ensure interoperability between designs.\n WiBro has a Peak Download speed of 128 Mbit/s and a Peak Upload speed of 56 Mbit/s.",
  "/wiki/5G": "5G is the fifth generation wireless technology for digital cellular networks that began wide deployment in 2019. As with previous standards, the covered areas are divided into regions called \"cells\", serviced by individual antennas. Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy them soon. The frequency spectrum of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, 4G.\n 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24\u00a0GHz reaching up to 72\u00a0GHz which is above the extremely high frequency band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n 5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 20 networks. Speeds in a 100\u00a0MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4\u00a0GHz to 4.2\u00a0GHz. Sprint and China Mobile are using 2.5\u00a0GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2\u00a0GHz, a range which offers increased reach. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.\n 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the United States, T-Mobile and AT&T launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on his 600\u00a0MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down. AT&T, using 850\u00a0MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n Verizon, AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n The industry project 3GPP defines any system using \"5G NR\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",[citation needed] a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Previously, some reserved the term for systems that deliver frequencies of 20\u00a0GHz shared called for by ITU IMT-2020. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU. In addition to traditional mobile operator services, 5G NR also addresses specific requirements for private mobile networks ranging from industrial IoT to critical communications.",

It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks.\n The 3GPP specification 38 series provides the technical details behind NR, the RAT beyond LTE.\n Study of NR within 3GPP started in 2015, and the first specification was made available by the end of 2017. While the 3GPP standardization process was ongoing, industry had already begun efforts to implement infrastructure compliant with the draft standard, with the expectation that the first large-scale commercial launch of 5G NR would occur in 2019.",

(Hangul: SK\ud154\ub808\ucf64 or \uc5d0\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud154\ub808\ucf64) is a South Korean wireless telecommunications operator; it is part of the SK Group, one of the country's largest chaebols.\n SK Telecom is South Korea's largest wireless carrier: it leads the local market with 50.5 percent share as of 2008. Since its creation in 1984, the company has evolved from a first generation analog cellular system, to second generation CDMA, then to the world's first third-generation synchronized IMT-2000 cellular system. SK Telecom also became the world's first carrier to commercialize HSDPA in May 2006. SK expanded into the landline market by acquiring second-rated fixed-line operator Hanaro Telecom in February 2008.\n The company's online brands include \"Nate,\" a web portal; \"June,\" a mobile multimedia service; \"Moneta,\" an e-banking mobile app; \"Nate Drive,\" a telematics service and \"Digital Home,\" an online interface to remote-control household appliances.\n In 2004, SK Telecom launched \"Hanbyul,\" the world's first DMB satellite. TU Media, SK Telecom's digital media arm, handles DMB TV broadcasts.\n In November 2015 SK Telecom announced signing a deal to acquire CJ HelloVision, the country's largest cable and Internet operator, with the view to merge it with its own cable unit, SK Broadband. The acquisition, which will make SK Broadband the No. 2 paid cable broadcaster following KT, is being opposed by competitors, who charge that the merger will help SK unfairly dominate the market."
