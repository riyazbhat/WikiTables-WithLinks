  "/wiki/Truss_bridge": "A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss, a structure of connected elements usually forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads.  The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently.",

  "/wiki/Brightwood_Beach_Cottage": "Brightwood Beach Cottage is an historic octagonal building on the southern shore of Lake Ripley in Litchfield, Minnesota, United States, that once was a part of the Brightwood Beach Resort of the late nineteenth century.  The resort opened in 1889, and it offered cultural amenities such as concerts, classes in fine arts, and other live entertainment.  Other summer activities included dancing, ball games, and canoeing and steamboat excursions on Lake Ripley.  The Minnesota Editorial Association, in a report at the time, called Brightwood \"the most lovely spot in Minnesota\" and a \"gem of a lake with pebbly shores and blue as the vaults of heaven.\"  Thousands of people visited the resort, many of them wealthy individuals pictured in suits and fancy dresses, but the resort was not financially successful.  In 1893, the resort was forced to close, a victim of the Panic of 1893 and competition from resorts to the north that became accessible by railroad.  The octagonal cottage that was used as a steamboat waiting area and landing station remained on Lake Ripley.  It was sold to Dr. Frank E. Bissell and later to Tipton Fester McClure in 1907. McClure was an investor in the Litchfield Glove Factory. The McClures rented it out after enclosing the south side with screens and making a kitchen and bedroom in the main part.  Vern Sederstrom bought the house in 1950 and he sold it to Raynold and Myrtle Allen, whose son Richard was a close friend of my brother Mike.  For many years, the octagonal cottage was the Allen\u2019s summer home.  The Allens had the cottage registered on the National Registry of Historical Places.  \nOn May 22, 1978, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places",

  "/wiki/Octagon_house": "Octagon houses were a unique house style briefly popular in the 1850s in the United States and Canada. They are characterised by an octagonal (eight-sided) plan, and often feature a flat roof and a veranda all round. Their unusual shape and appearance, quite different from the ornate pitched-roof houses typical of the period, can generally be traced to the influence of one man, amateur architect and lifestyle pundit Orson Squire Fowler. Although there are other octagonal houses worldwide, the term octagon house usually refers specifically to octagonal houses built in North America during this period, and up to the early 1900s.",

  "/wiki/Litchfield_Opera_House": "The Litchfield Opera House is a community building in Litchfield, Minnesota listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance to the community.  A committee of businessmen organized in 1899 with the intention of providing a place to hold meetings and theatrical performances.  The previous town hall, built in 1871, was obsolete.  The government of Litchfield Township, Minnesota paid for construction of the building, which was designed by architect W.T. Towner and built by N.P. Franzen.  The city bought the building from the township in 1911.  The opera house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n The building is a well-preserved example of Renaissance Revival architecture, which is otherwise rare in Litchfield and Meeker County.  Most of the facade is yellow clay brick, manufactured locally, and accented with red brick and red terra cotta patterns.  The opera house opened on November 8, 1900, with the play \"The Marble Heart\" starring William Owen.  Besides operas and performances, the auditorium housed town meetings, elections, military recruitment, and other government functions.  Somewhere between 1930 and 1939, the interior was remodeled for use as city offices.  In 1983, when the building was nominated to the National Register, it housed civic offices and organizations, and it was used as a meeting place for senior citizens, the Girl Scouts, and community education. Public officials and the Litchfield Police Department also used some of the rooms.  In 2002, the city removed its offices from the building and moved its offices to trailers in the parking lot.  This move was made because mold was found in the building.  The city completed its new city hall in 2006, but the fate of the building had not been decided yet.  In 2008, the city sold the building to the Greater Litchfield Opera House Association, Inc. for $100,000.  The city accepted a 1900 silver dollar for payment and specified that the balance of the purchase price would be invested in the building to renovate it for the community.\n The building is available for rental for parties, weddings, dinners, funeral, bar mitzvahs, and other personal events.",

  "/wiki/Dakota_War_of_1862": "The Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Sioux Uprising, the Dakota Uprising, the Sioux Outbreak of 1862, the Dakota Conflict, the U.S.\u2013Dakota War of 1862 or Little Crow's War, was an armed conflict between the United States and several bands of Dakota (also known as the eastern 'Sioux'). It began on August 17, 1862, along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota, four years after its admission as a state. Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war, treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota. During the war, the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants, which resulted in settler deaths, and caused many to flee the area. Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families. A military tribunal quickly tried the men, sentencing 303 to death for their crimes. President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them. The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26, 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota; it was the largest mass execution in United States history.\n Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them (introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota). In mid-1862, the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent, Thomas J. Galbraith. The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions, and negotiations reached an impasse.\n On August 17, 1862, one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition. That night a council of Dakota decided to attack settlements throughout the Minnesota River valley to try to drive whites out of the area. There has never been an official report on the number of settlers killed, although in President Abraham Lincoln's second annual address, he said that no fewer than 800 men, women, and children had died.\n Over the next several months, continued battles of the Dakota against settlers and later, the United States Army, ended with the surrender of most of the Dakota bands. By late December 1862, US soldiers had taken captive more than a thousand Dakota, including women, children and elderly men in addition to warriors, who were interned in jails in Minnesota. After trials and sentencing by a military court, 38 Dakota men were hanged on December 26, 1862 in Mankato in the largest one-day mass execution in American history. In April 1863, the rest of the Dakota were expelled from Minnesota to Nebraska and South Dakota. The United States Congress abolished their reservations. Additionally, the Ho-Chunk people living on reservation lands near Mankato were expelled from Minnesota as a result of the war.",

  "/wiki/Carpenter_Gothic": "Carpenter Gothic, also sometimes called Carpenter's Gothic or Rural Gothic, is a North American architectural style-designation for an application of Gothic Revival architectural detailing and picturesque massing applied to wooden structures built by house-carpenters. The abundance of North American timber and the carpenter-built vernacular architectures based upon it made a picturesque improvisation upon Gothic a natural evolution. Carpenter Gothic improvises upon features that were carved in stone in authentic Gothic architecture, whether original or in more scholarly revival styles; however, in the absence of the restraining influence of genuine Gothic structures, the style was freed to improvise and emphasize charm and quaintness rather than fidelity to received models. The genre received its impetus from the publication by Alexander Jackson Davis of Rural Residences and from detailed plans and elevations in publications by Andrew Jackson Downing.",

  "/wiki/Universal_Laboratories_Building": "Universal Laboratories Building is a building in Dassel, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It was listed on the National Register for its role in the production of ergot from the mid-1930s through the late 1960s.\n The business was established in 1935 as Rice Laboratories, as a manufacturer of yeast for livestock feed.  Yeast was used as a feed supplement because the enzymes fermenting in the digestive tracts of hogs and poultry would break down food and help in nutrient absorption.  In 1937, the company built a new building on the north edge of town.  In that same year, the manager of the company, Lester R. Peel, started production of ergot.  Local farmers were discarding rye that was infected with sclerotia growths, because the ergot could cause deadly poisoning.  Peel, a former school teacher, understood that the ergot also had medical applications, such as controlling postpartum bleeding and treating vasoconstriction, hypertension, vascular headaches, and migraines.\n Peel gave the ergot business the name Universal Laboratories.  Production initially began with ergotic rye bought from local farmers.  Universal Laboratories staff would then bring the rye through small mills that would break up the rye kernels.  They would then pick the grain from the conveyor belt and let the ergot fall into a receptacle for bagging.  The company also hired people to work from their homes in Dassel picking and bagging ergot.  Later, the process was improved by new machines that automated the process of separating the ergot from the rye.  The grain was passed through mills that would flow into gravity separators, which had spiraling chutes that would separate the light ergot kernels from the heavier rye kernels.\n Peel had good timing getting into the ergot business, because supplies in the United States had been subject to disruption.  Russia was the world's principal exporter of ergot until the Russian Revolution in 1917.  Spain then became the top producer of ergot, but supplies were then disrupted with the Spanish Civil War in 1936.  In an effort to ensure his supply of raw materials, Peel began a campaign to educate farmers on the importance of ergot.  Eli Lilly and Company, one of Peel's major customers, also assisted in this effort by providing publicity.  Universal Laboratories began receiving considerable amounts of ergotic rye, which was stored in a grain elevator in downtown Dassel.  The company supplied the vast majority of domestically produced ergot in the United States during World War II.  In 1940, they produced 60,000 pounds (27,000 kg), while in 1941, production was 100,000 pounds (45,000 kg).\n Eli Lilly continued to do business with Universal Laboratories, even after World War II ended and foreign supplies became more stable.  Peel died in 1959, and the company ceased producing yeast somewhere around that time.  In the late 1960s, Eli Lilly dropped Universal Laboratories in favor of European suppliers of ergot.  The company continued business for a while longer, providing ergot to Burroughs Wellcome, but it went out of business in 1975.  The building sat empty until the late 1990s, when local citizens rehabilitated the structure.  It now houses the Dassel Area Historical Society and its museum.",
