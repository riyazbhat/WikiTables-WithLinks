  "/wiki/Essbase": "Essbase is a multidimensional database management system (MDBMS) that provides a multidimensional database platform upon which to build analytic applications. Essbase, whose name derives from \"extended spreadsheet database\", began as a product of Arbor Software, which merged with Hyperion Software in 1998. Oracle Corporation acquired Hyperion Solutions Corporation in 2007, as of 2009[update] Oracle marketed Essbase as \"Oracle Essbase\" (an on-premises product) and more recently, Essbase is offered as part of the Oracle Analytics Cloud. Until late 2005 IBM also marketed an OEM version of Essbase as DB2 OLAP Server. The database researcher E. F. Codd coined the term \"on-line analytical processing\" (OLAP) in a whitepaper\nthat set out twelve rules for analytic systems (an allusion to his earlier famous set of twelve rules defining the relational model). This whitepaper, published by Computerworld, was somewhat explicit in its reference to Essbase features, and when it was later discovered that Codd had been sponsored by Arbor Software, Computerworld withdrew the paper. In contrast to \"on-line transaction processing\" (OLTP), OLAP defines a database technology optimized for processing human queries rather than transactions. The results of this orientation were that multidimensional databases oriented their performance requirements around a different set of benchmarks (Analytic Performance Benchmark, APB-1) than that of RDBMS (Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)).",

The database server component of the software platform retains its historical name TM1. Data is stored in in-memory multidimensional OLAP cubes, generally at the \"leaf\" level, and consolidated on demand. In addition to data, cubes can include encoded rules which define any on-demand calculations. By design, computations (typically aggregation along dimensional hierarchies using weighted summation) on the data are performed in near real-time, without the need to precalculate, due to a highly performant database design and calculation engine. These properties also allow the data to be updated frequently and by multiple users. TM1 is an example of a class of software products which implement the principles of the functional database model. The IBM Planning Analytics platform, in addition to the TM1 database server, includes an ETL tool, server management and monitoring tools and a number of user front ends which provide capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements, including workflow, adjustments, commentary, etc.",

In the early 1970s, the software was primarily leased to other agricultural departments in order to analyze the effect soil, weather and seed varieties had on crop yields. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health and later by  a coalition of university statistics programs called the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations. By 1976 the software had 100 customers and 300 people attended the first SAS user conference in Kissimmee, Florida that year. Goodnight, Barr, Sall and another early participant, Jane Helwig, founded SAS Institute Inc. as a private company on July 1, 1976, in offices across the street from the university. Barr and Helwig later sold their interest in the company. SAS' tradition of polling users for suggestions to improve the software through the SASWare Ballot was adopted during its first year of operation.",
