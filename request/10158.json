  "/wiki/Billings_County_Courthouse": "The Billings County Courthouse in Medora, North Dakota was built c.1880 and was remodeled in 1913 with architect John Tester.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\n According to its NRHP nomination, the courthouse \"symbolizes the orderly administration of justice in a county which is one of the least populated in North Dakota.

  "/wiki/Little_Missouri_River_(North_Dakota)": "The Little Missouri River is a tributary of the Missouri River, 560 miles (901\u00a0km) long, in the northern Great Plains of the United States. Rising in northeastern Wyoming, in western Crook County about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) west of Devils Tower, it flows northeastward, across a corner of southeastern Montana, and into South Dakota. In South Dakota, it flows northward through the Badlands into North Dakota, crossing the Little Missouri National Grassland and both units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. In the north unit of the park, it turns eastward and flows into the Missouri in Dunn County at Lake Sakakawea, where it forms an arm of the reservoir 30 miles (48\u00a0km) long called Little Missouri Bay and joins the main channel of the Missouri about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) northeast of Killdeer.\n The highly seasonal runoff from badlands and other treeless landscapes along the Little Missouri carries heavy loads of eroded sediment downstream.  The sedimentary layers, which extend from the headwaters in Wyoming all the way to the mouth in North Dakota, vary in age, but most of the beds along the river belong to the Bullion Creek and Sentinel Butte formations, both deposited during the Paleocene (about 66 to 56\u00a0million years ago). The deposits include siltstone, claystone, sandstone, and lignite coal laid down in a coastal plain during the Laramide orogeny.",

These sites are documented as part of a driving tour through the region.",
  "/wiki/Little_Missouri_National_Grassland": "Little Missouri National Grassland is a National Grassland located in western North Dakota, USA. At 1,028,051 acres (416,037\u00a0ha), it is the largest grassland in the country. Enclaved within its borders is Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which is managed by the National Park Service (and therefore not included in the preceding statistics). The Little Missouri National Grassland was once a part of the Custer National Forest, but is now a part of the Dakota Prairie Grasslands, a National Forest unit consisting entirely of National Grasslands.  A predominant feature of the grassland is colorful and beautiful badlands, a rugged terrain extensively eroded by wind and water. It is a mixed grass prairie, meaning it has both long and short grass.\n The boundaries of the grasslands on certain maps can be misleading.  Within the boundaries of the national grassland are significant portions of state-owned and privately owned land, much of it leased by cattle ranchers for grazing. Overall, in descending order of land area, it is located in parts of McKenzie, Billings, Slope, and Golden Valley counties.\n Private land intersperses the public grassland acres and there is heavy cattle grazing throughout with 253 allotments in the Medora district and more than 190 allotments in the Mckenzie district.\nWhite Butte, North Dakota's highest point, is located in the extreme southeast corner of the grassland, south of the town of Amidon.\n The grassland is administered by the Forest Service as part of the Dakota Prairie Grasslands from offices in Bismarck, North Dakota. There are local ranger district offices in Dickinson and Watford City.\n The ongoing oil and gas exploration, extraction, and distribution in the region has the potential for long term negative impacts on the soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife of the grassland, including threatened and endangered species.",

These are either conical-shaped or earthen lodges constructed by Mandan tribes or by others.  A study of the Little Missouri River area in 2008 states that four timbered lodges were located in the South Unit of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which is just north of Medora.  It noted that these may have Eurasian participation, i.e. not be built or used solely by indigenous peoples.",

It is the only American national park named directly after a single person.",
  "/wiki/Elkhorn_Ranch": "The Elkhorn Ranch was established by Theodore Roosevelt on the banks of the Little Missouri River 35 miles north of Medora, North Dakota in the summer of 1884. Roosevelt hired Bill Sewall and Wilmot Dow, two Maine woodsmen, to run the ranch. Sewall and Dow built the ranch house, \"a long, low house of logs,\" in the winter of 1884\u20131885.\n The Elkhorn Ranch was Theodore Roosevelt's \"main ranch\", and his preferred ranch house because it was larger and more private than his Maltese Cross Ranch cabin, established in 1883. Roosevelt particularly enjoyed sitting in the veranda in a rocking chair, reading in the shade of the cottonwood trees. His enjoyment is evident in his books, Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail, Hunting Trips of a Ranchman, and The Wilderness Hunter.\n In the spring of 1886, thieves stole Roosevelt's boat from the Elkhorn Ranch. Hastily, Sewall and Dow built a raft and all three set off downriver to catch the thieves. When they did, Roosevelt kept watch over the three thieves with a shotgun and marched them overland to Dickinson, North Dakota, where he collected a $50 reward.\n Roosevelt quit the ranch in 1887 after losing 60% of his stock in the starvation winter of 1886\u201387, and returned only a handful of times to the badlands after that. He kept a small share of the cattle until 1898 at the outset of the Spanish\u2013American War.\n Theodore Roosevelt's writing desk from the Elkhorn Ranch is on display at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The Elkhorn Ranch Site itself is protected as a unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",
