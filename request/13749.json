The phrase was coined in 1998 during a vigil held in Terrace, British Columbia for four murdered and two missing women. There are a disproportionately high number of Indigenous women on the list of victims. Proposed explanations for the years-long endurance of the crimes and the limited progress in identifying culprits include systemic racism, poverty, drug abuse, widespread domestic violence, disconnection with traditional culture and disruption of the family unit through the foster care system and Canadian Indian residential school system. Poverty in particular leads to low rates of car ownership and mobility, thus hitchhiking is often the only way for many to travel vast distances to see family or go to work, school, or seek medical treatment. Another factor leading to abductions and murders is that the area is largely isolated and remote, with soft soil in many areas and carnivorous scavengers to carry away human remains; these factors precipitate violent attacks as perpetrators feel a sense of impunity, privacy and the ability to easily carry out their crimes and hide evidence.",

  "/wiki/Davao_Death_Squad": "The Davao Death Squad (DDS) is an alleged vigilante group in Davao City, with connections to former Davao mayor, and current Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. The group is alleged to have conducted summary executions of street children and individuals suspected of petty crimes and drug dealing. It has been estimated that the group is responsible for the killing or disappearance of between 1,020 and 1,040 people between 1998 and 2008. In as early as 2005, the US State Department has received reports of the Human Rights Commission's (HRC) investigation regarding the alleged connection of the Duterte political dynasty of Davao to the killings. This was followed by another investigation in 2009. The investigation was discontinued due to the stonewalling of the local government under Theresa and the lack of public outrage. The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in October 2019 stating that they found no evidence that the Davao Death Squad exists, and no evidence to connect the police or Duterte with the killings.",

Between 1946 and 1956, 163 of his patients probably died while in a coma, so deemed to be worthy of investigation. In addition, 132 out of 310 patients had left Adams money or items in their wills. He was tried and acquitted for the murder of one patient in 1957. Another count of murder was withdrawn by the prosecution in what was later described as \"an abuse of process\" by the presiding judge Sir Patrick Devlin, causing questions to be asked in Parliament about the prosecution's handling of events. The trial was featured in headlines around the world and was described at the time as \"one of the greatest murder trials of all time\" and \"murder trial of the century\". It was also described at the time as \"unique\" because, in the words of the judge, \"the act of murder\" had \"to be proved by expert evidence.\"",
