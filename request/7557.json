  "/wiki/ISPS_Handa_Women's_Australian_Open": "The Women's Australian Open is a women's professional golf tournament played in Australia, operated by Golf Australia and the ALPG Tour, long co-sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour (LET). Beginning with the 2012 event, it is also co-sanctioned by the U.S.-based LPGA Tour. In 2008, it was the second-richest women's golf tournament on the ALPG Tour, with a prize fund of A$500,000, and was raised to A$600,000 in 2010. With the co-sanctioning by the LPGA, the total purse was nearly doubled, and was also fixed in U.S. dollars. The purse was US$1.1 million in 2012, and increased again to its current level of US$1.2 million for 2013. Since 2011, the tournament's name has been the ISPS Handa Women's Australian Open.\n The Australian Ladies Open was founded in 1974 as a 54-hole event, but folded after 1978.  It was resurrected in 1994 as the Women's Australian Open, this time as a 72-hole event.  Annika S\u00f6renstam won that year, which was her first professional win.  It was also Karrie Webb's professional debut, and she would later win the event five times.  Starting in 2000, the Ladies European Tour began co-sanctioning the tournament.  Following the 2004 event, sponsorship difficulties caused the tournament to stop once again, but after a two-year hiatus the tournament returned in 2007.  The Women's Australian Open usually moves between various courses around Australia, except from 1995 through 2002 when it was held at the Yarra Yarra Golf Club in Melbourne.  The 2008 event was held at Kingston Heath Golf Club.\n For several years after its return in 1994, the Women's Australian Open was played early in the ALPG schedule, usually in November.  Starting in 2000, it was changed to be played at the end of the schedule in February near the ANZ Ladies Masters, to allow both tournaments to be part of the Ladies European Tour.  Since the Women's Australian Open was played from 12\u201315 November 1998 during the 1998/1999 ALPG season, it was therefore not played during the 1999 calendar year.\n The 2012 tournament was played at the Composite Course at Royal Melbourne, the championship course comprising 12 holes from the West course and six from the East course.  The Composite Course is considered one of the top courses in the world, and was used for the Presidents Cup competitions in 1998 and 2011. Through 2011, a women's professional competition had never been held on it; the 2012 Women's Australian Open was the first. The event was won by Jessica Korda after an historic six-player playoff, only the second in ALPG history. Korda holed a 25-foot (8\u00a0m) birdie putt on  the second playoff hole to claim her first LPGA Tour victory.\n In 2013, the tournament moved to Royal Canberra Golf Club, and in 2014 to the Victoria Golf Club near Melbourne.

Like its men's counterpart, it is a two-cut tournament.  The field is reduced to 60 after the second round and 35 after the third round; those who fail to make the second cut earn prize money.\n Starting in 2019, the event is now co-sanctioned by the LPGA Tour, and will continue to be played alongside the men's Victorian Open, now co-sanctioned by the European Tour. The double cut continues; 65 players will remain after the first cut, then 35 players after the Saturday cut.",
  "/wiki/ALPG_Tour": "The ALPG Tour is a professional golf tour for women which is based in Australia. ALPG stands for Australian Ladies Professional Golf.\n The ALPG was founded as the Ladies Professional Golf Association of Australia (LPGAA) in 1972 by Alan Gillott, who also later on founded \"The Golfer\" newspaper, a free publication provided to golfers and golf clubs, Australia-wide. The LPGAA switched to its current name (ALPG) in 1991. The first events featured twelve competitors, and the early years were a struggle. However the long term trend was of gradual expansion and by 2004 there were over 150 members.\n The season features about a dozen tournaments, usually played over the Australian summer between November and March. The ANZ Ladies Masters and MFS Women's Australian Open have long been the leading events on the tour, with both being co-sanctioned with the more prestigious Ladies European Tour (LET) which helps attract a higher quality field. In 2010 the New Zealand Women's Open became the third tournament to be co-sanctioned by the LET. The ANZ Masters, the Australian Open and the New Zealand Open have prize funds of A$600,000, A$500,000 and A$400,000 respectively, each higher than the prize funds of all 10 remaining events combined. The New South Wales Open and the Royal Canberra Ladies Classic have purses of A$100,000 and A$125,000 respectively, and no other event has a purse of over A$25,000. Since 2012, the Women's Australian Open has also been co-sanctioned by the U.S. LPGA Tour; in its first year as an LPGA Tour event, the prize fund increased to US$1.1 million. The purse increased to US$1.2 million effective in 2013.\n Australian Karrie Webb, one of the leading players in global women's golf, has a background on the tour, and continues to play in its two main events each season. However Webb and other leading members of the ALPG spend most of the year competing outside Australia, principally on the LPGA Tour and the Ladies European Tour.\n In January 2012, New Zealand's Lydia Ko became the youngest person ever to win a professional golf tour event by winning the ALPG-sanctioned Bing Lee Samsung Women's NSW Open."
