It cuts through the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte. Settlements along the banks of the river include the City of Marawi, the Municipality of Linamon and the City of Iligan. It separates into two channels as it drains to Iligan Bay; one going over the Maria Cristina Falls while the other supplies the Tinago Falls. The river descends for about 2,200 feet (670\u00a0m) from its source as it flows for 21 miles (34\u00a0km) before draining to the sea. The river is relatively shallow as it is only 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) deep in some areas. The Agus River's watershed spans about 11,320.00 hectares. In 1992, the National Power Corporation financed the reforestation of the Lake Lanao-Agus River watershed, planting over 1500 hectares of Acacia mangium, Durio zibethinus and other indigenous trees.  It has a discharge of about 10 cubic metres per second (350\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) and flows from a narrow depression off the northwestern rim of the lake and flows over a basalt rock formation.
