  "/wiki/Cyril_Jackson_(educationist)": "Sir Cyril Jackson KBE (6 February 1863 \u2013 3 September 1924) was a British educationist, important in the development of education in Western Australia.\n Jackson, eldest son of Laurence Morris Jackson, was born in England. Educated at the Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford, Jackson graduated in 1885 with honours in Literae Humaniores. After leaving Oxford he took up social work at Toynbee Hall for about 10 years from 1885, and was central secretary of the Children's Country Holiday Fund. He became a member of the London School Board in 1891, and in 1896 was appointed inspector-general of schools in Western Australia. Education in the colony had been for many years in a pitifully primitive state, but in 1890 a forward step was made by the appointment of an Englishman, J. P. Walton, as inspector of schools. He pointed out how far behind the schools were lagging, and brought about many improvements. But the population was increasing very rapidly, numerous new schools were being built, and it was realized that the system would have to be completely re-organized. \n With Walton as his first assistant, Jackson set to work with vigor. Jackson had great educational knowledge and first rate executive ability, and the foundations on which future developments could be raised were securely laid. In 1899 a beginning was made with technical education, in the following year school fees were abolished, and in 1901 a college was built for the training of teachers. The designs of the schools, the staffing and equipment, were all greatly improved. He also became the first Chairman of the West Guildford (City Of Bassadean) Roads Board, the inaugural meeting of which was held in the billiard room of Jackson\u2019s house on 12 July 1901. Official recognition of the new municipality followed a week later on 19 July 1901. When Jackson returned to England aboard the Indic in 1903 he left behind him a well-organized modern system of education. An economist, an Anglican churchman, and a believer in voluntary agencies, he opposed unnecessary expenditure, and supported non-provided schools.",

Founded in 1379 by William of Wykeham, the full name of the college is St Mary's College of Winchester in Oxford.

Johnson was Member of Parliament for Henley from 2001 to 2008 and has been MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a one-nation conservative.\n Johnson was born in New York City to upper-middle class English parents and educated at Eton College. He read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1986. He began his career in journalism at The Times newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for The Daily Telegraph newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing Eurosceptic sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited The Spectator magazine from 1999 to 2005. He was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a Junior Shadow Minister under Conservative leaders Michael Howard and David Cameron. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' party line but adopted a socially liberal stance on issues such as LGBT rights in parliamentary votes. He resigned as an MP and in 2008 was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in 2012. During his mayoralty he oversaw the 2012 Summer Olympics, introduced the New Routemaster buses, cycle hire scheme, and Thames cable car and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n In 2015, Johnson was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful Vote Leave campaign for Brexit.

In the  2019 general election, Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979. The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union under the terms of Johnson's Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n Johnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, elitism, and cronyism, and of using offensive language. Johnson is the subject of several biographies and fictionalised portrayals.",

Its main buildings are on Parks Road, opposite the University Museum and the University Parks. The college is bordered to the north by Keble Road, to the south by Museum Road, and to the west by Blackhall Road.\n Keble was established in 1870, having been built as a monument to John Keble, who had been a leading member of the Oxford Movement which sought to stress the Catholic nature of the Church of England. Consequently, the college's original teaching focus was primarily theological, although the college now offers a broad range of subjects, reflecting the diversity of degrees offered across the wider university. In the period after the Second World War the trends were towards scientific courses (proximity to the university science area east of the University Museum influenced this). As originally constituted, it was for men only and the fellows were mostly bachelors resident in the college. Like many of Oxford's men's colleges, Keble admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979.\n It remains distinctive for its still-controversial neo-gothic red-brick buildings designed by William Butterfield. The buildings are also notable for breaking from Oxbridge tradition by arranging rooms along corridors rather than around staircases, in order that the scouts could supervise the comings and goings of visitors. (Girton College, Cambridge, similarly breaks this tradition.)\n Keble is one of the larger colleges of the University of Oxford, with 433 undergraduates and 245 graduate students in 2011/12.

Sayers and many activists, have played a major role in feminism. Today, around 50 per cent of the students are male.\n Somerville has the biggest college library in Oxford and is known for its varied architecture and liberal atmosphere. Its liberal character traces back to its foundation by social liberals as the first non-denominational college in Oxford, deliberately unlike the strictly Anglican Lady Margaret Hall, the other women's college opened in the same year. Somerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass and in 1964, Somerville became one of the first colleges to abandon the policy of locking its gates at night to prevent students staying out late. No gowns are worn during Formal Halls.\n The current principal is Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, who succeeded Alice Prochaska in 2017.

  "/wiki/Lena_Townsend": "Lena Moncrieff Townsend CBE (3 November 1911 \u2013 17 November 2004) was a British Conservative politician in London and served briefly as Leader of the Inner London Education Authority.\n She was born in Cairo as Lena Westropp, the daughter of a wealthy expatriate British family, and her early years ensured that she had a wide experience of culture. However, she was sent to England to Downe House, a girls' boarding school which specialised in the daughters of colonial servants. She was promising academically and attended Somerville College, Oxford and the University of Heidelberg.\n During the Second World War she was an organiser for the Women's Voluntary Service and the Land Army. She married twice, firstly Henry Peat, and then John Townsend. In 1955 she was first elected to the London County Council for her home seat of Hampstead, and took a special interest in the Education Committee. She was chosen to be Leader of the Opposition on the Education Committee from the early 1960s.\n Townsend was an unsuccessful candidate in the first Greater London Council election of 1964, being defeated in Camden. However, in 1967 she was more fortunate and won by about 4,000 votes. This brought with it membership of the LCC Education Committee's successor body, the Inner London Education Authority, and it was there that Townsend concentrated. The Conservatives had won narrow control of ILEA and Townsend ran for the Leadership, but lost to Christopher Chataway who was the preferred candidate of the Conservative Party nationally.\n Chataway did make Townsend his Deputy, and Chairman of the Schools Committee. The two worked well as a team, with both clearly on the left of the Conservative Party. Townsend supported 'Schools Councils' for pupils to take some responsibility for the management of their schools. She was nominated as a member of the Race Relations Board Conciliation Committee for London in 1968. She was a founder member of the Conservative Group for Europe.\n In 1969 Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in a byelection, and stepped down from the ILEA Leadership. Townsend was chosen as his successor, and largely continued his moderate policies. When Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse attacked a BBC sex education film, Townsend defended it. She was however faced with a strike of teachers in November that year over a national pay claim.\n Fighting for re-election in 1970, Townsend promoted the record of three years of Conservative ILEA by pointing to the success in reducing class sizes by employing more teachers. However, there was a small swing to Labour, who regained control; Townsend lost her seat in Camden but was elected as an Alderman to the GLC and co-opted to ILEA's Education Committee. She remained as Leader of the Opposition until February 1971 when she resigned, saying that she needed a paying job.\n Townsend remained an Alderman of the GLC until 1977 when the Aldermanic system was abolished. She was a member of several bodies, most prominently as a Governor of the London College of Fashion (and Chair of Governors from 1967 to 1986). In Edward Heath's Dissolution Honours list of 1974 she was awarded a CBE. Keeping the links with the country of her birth, she was President of the Anglo-Egyptian Association from 1961 until it was wound up in 1987.",
