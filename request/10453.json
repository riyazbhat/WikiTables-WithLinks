In the history of Pune, the city was once known as \"Kasbe Pune\".\n Kasba Ganapati is the Gram Devta of Pune. It was built during Shivaji's reign.

It is well known for the Kumbhar Wada (area of earthen potmakers) and the Tambat Ali (area of brass/copper utensil manufacturers).\n There is a story about the Kasba Ganpati: Some children had brought cows to the area for grazing, and found an idol of Ganapati. Then, they colored this idol and started worshipping it. Shivaji's mother Jijabai also visited the temple often. Hence, Dadoji Konddeo built a pendol in front of the idol; this is where the Kasba Ganpati Temple is located today.\n The part of the Peth near the Mutha river is known as Kumbhar Wada (locality of the earthen pot makers).

  "/wiki/Chalukya": "The Chalukya dynasty ([t\u0283a\u02d0\u026dukj\u0259]) was a Classical Indian royal dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.\n The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". Kannada literature, which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the Jain and Veerashaiva traditions. The 11th century saw the patronage of Telugu literature under the Eastern Chalukyas.",
