The lyrics are often the subject of humour, as the chorus features the Dutch lines Oh oh, ik heb zorgen, oh oh, ik heb zorgen/Oh oh, ik heb zorgen en dat verveelt me zo, with the phrase en dat verveelt me zo being variously translated as And that worries me a lot and And that bothers me a lot, both of which sound odd in English.

In 1970, they sang Waterman (written by Pieter Goemans) as the Netherlands entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. They finished 7th out of 12 participants. Their single It's Great Fun was arguably their most popular at the time. [citation needed] They collaborated in 1972 on a single with Marius Monkau. The song Oh Complete Jesus is still popular, especially among religious people. [citation needed]\n In the mid-1970s the group moved to Belgium. There they formed Dream Express in 1975 with former Pebbles musician Luc Smets (who married Bianca). In the summer of 1976 they had a Flemish number 2 hit with the self-titled song Dream Express.",

In 1970 the Maessen sisters had represented their native Netherlands with Waterman, then under the group moniker Hearts of Soul. A Million in One, Two, Three was performed seventeenth on the night, following Finland's Monica Aspelund with Lapponia and preceding France's Marie Myriam with L'oiseau et l'enfant. At the close of voting, it had received 69 points, coming seventh in a field of eighteen. The song is an up-tempo, disco-influenced number that deals with the group needing a million (dollars) and pleading with Mister President (of a company) for a job. They go on to describe the affluent lifestyle they hope to live with the money. It was succeeded as Belgian representative at the 1978 Contest by Jean Vall\u00e9e performing L'amour \u00e7a fait chanter la vie. Stella Maessen returned to the Contest as a solo artist in 1982 with Si tu aimes ma musique, again representing Belgium. The Conductor for Dream Express that night was the English Bandleader and Musical Arranger Alyn Ainsworth.

  "/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1978": "The Eurovision Song Contest 1978 was the 23rd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It was held on 22 April 1978 in Paris. The contest was won by Izhar Cohen & the Alphabeta who represented Israel with the song A-Ba-Ni-Bi. Although 'A-Ba-Ni-Bi' is the correct title, French television mistakenly captioned on screen the song title as 'Ah-Bah-Nee-Bee'. The presenters were Denise Fabre and L\u00e9on Zitrone, and this was the first time more than one presenter hosted an edition of the Contest and the first to have a male presenter since 1956. In addition, the two presenters served as commentators for France. Twenty countries participated, a record at the time. The winning entry was a love song sung in the Hebrew equivalent of Ubbi dubbi (the title is an expansion of the Hebrew word ani \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9, meaning I). This was Israel's first Eurovision win. The win caused problems for several North African and Middle-Eastern nations that were televising the contest, even though they were not participating. According to author and political commentator John Kennedy O'Connor in his book The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History, when Israel became the clear winners during the voting, most of the Arabic stations ended their transmission of the contest. Jordanian TV finished the show with a photo of a bunch of daffodils on screen, later announcing that the Belgian entry (which finished second) was the winner.",

This was Vall\u00e9e's second participation in the Contest, in 1970 he had finished 8th with Viens l'oublier. L'amour \u00e7a fait chanter la vie was performed tenth on the night (following Switzerland's Carole Vinci with Vivre and preceding the Netherlands' Harmony with 't Is OK). At the close of voting, it had received 125 points, coming second in a field of twenty after Israel's A-Ba-Ni-Bi. This would remain Belgium's best showing in the Contest until Sandra Kim's win with J'aime la vie in 1986. The song is a dramatic ballad about the power of love, specifically the way in which it can enhance life. The lyrics include the image that love makes one a musician/A real little Chopin/just for a blonde. Vall\u00e9e also recorded the song in English and Spanish as, respectively, Goodbye and El amor hace cantar la vida.

Therefore, this was Israel's consecutive second win, and overall second win, in the contest. 19 countries participated, the 20 countries that took part at the previous 1978 Contest, except for Turkey which was also going to participate but eventually withdrew its entry for political reasons. Yugoslavia, who missed the 1978 Contest, also didn't want to take part nor transmit the 1979 show for political reasons.

Hey Nana was the source of some controversy between the artist and the Belgian TV channel BRT (now (VRT). Marah herself preferred another song from the Belgian pre-selections, Comment \u00e7a va, and consequently - and very unusually for an artist representing his or her country in the Contest - never made a studio recording of her Eurovision entry, not even for promotional purposes. The only commercially released version of Hey Nana was instead made by the composer, Charles Dumolin. The song was performed twelfth on the night (following France's Anne-Marie David with Je suis l'enfant soleil and preceding Luxembourg's Jeane Manson with J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u00e7a dans tes yeux). At the close of voting, it had received 5 points, 2 from Denmark and the United Kingdom and 1 from Germany, finishing 18th (shared last) of 19.

The band were moderately pleased with the outcome of the Contest, but for a somewhat unusual reason. At the time lead singer Michel Moers was quoted as saying: We had hoped to finish last, but Portugal decided otherwise. We got ten points from them and finished on the 19th [sic] spot. In hindsight their participation in the Contest however seems to have served its marketing purposes; some thirty years on Euro-Vision still remains one of the band's best-known songs, both in Belgium and internationally. The song was the first entry ever to mention the Contest by name as part of what is generally agreed to have been a send-up of the whole event (previous entries such as Schmetterlinge's Boom Boom Boomerang had parodied the Contest without actually naming it). Further, in contrast to the generally upbeat and lively entries submitted from other entrants, Telex performed from behind synthesisers and in a robotic - somewhat Kraftwerk-esque - manner. Telex released the song in French and English language versions and the band subsequently re-recorded the track for their first 'greatest hits' compilation More than Distance, also released in 1980, then retitled Neurovision. Furthermore, in 1993 Telex released their first CD box set, once again with a reference to their Eurovision participation back in 1980; the album was entitled Belgium.One Point.",

At the close of voting, it had received 13 points, placing 18th in a field of 20. The song is an up-beat synthpop number, which despite its modest success in the actual Contest still held a record in Eurovision history until 1998; the lyrics consist of one single line and a total of eleven - apparently nonsensical - words; Rendez-vous, maar de maat is vol en m'n kop is toe (Rendez-vous, but that's the limit, and I clam up) with the duo repeating the phrase on multiple occasions. The band also recorded an English-language version of the song, then with one word less than the Dutch original; Rendez-vous, better give it up, I don't have a clue. Fifteen years later Finland would go on to beat Pas De Deux's record in the 1998 Contest with Aava, which in turn only contains six words repeated throughout the song. Norway currently holds the record for the winning Eurovision entry with the shortest lyrics, in 1995 they won with Nocturne performed by Secret Garden, with a total of twenty-four words. Rendez-vous was a highly polarizing choice for the contest at the time, with many people utterly disliking it.

Israel withdrew from the contest due to Yom Hazikaron (Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism) being commemorated on the same date. Iceland was going to participate but withdrew due to lack of financial support. 1984 is also a notable for the audible booing that could be heard from the audience, particularly at the end of the UK's performance.
