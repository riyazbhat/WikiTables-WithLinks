  "/wiki/Fitzroy_Football_Club": "The Fitzroy Football Club, nicknamed the Lions or the Roys, is an Australian rules football club formed in 1883 to represent the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, Victoria and was a foundation member club of the Victorian Football League (now the Australian Football League) on its inception in 1897. Despite being the first club to win a VFL Grand Final they were not the first team to win a premiership. That honour belongs to the Essendon Football Club who were crowned premiers in 1897 without a Grand Final being played. Although Fitzroy won a total of eight VFL premierships they never won a premiership as the Lions. They won seven premierships (1898, 1899, 1904, 1905, 1913, 1916 and 1922) as the Maroons and one (1944) as the Gorillas. The decision of the club to change its name to the \u2018Lions\u2019 in 1957 coincided with what history now records as the beginning of decades of poor on-field performance and financial mismanagement that eventually resulted in the club being placed into administration and forced out of the AFL in 1996. Although the club managed to survive and came out of administration in 1998 it never played in the AFL again. Fitzroy largely resumed its original VFL-AFL identity through its continued use of their 1975\u20131996 VFL-AFL jumper, their theme song and their 1884\u20131966 home ground at the Brunswick Street Oval.",

After a long stint in the Hawthorn reserves, and limited opportunity in the senior side for his first two seasons, he was selected by St Kilda in the 1996 March draft. Given this new opportunity, Young had a successful 1996 season, ranking high in St Kilda's best and fairest award. He was plagued by a number of injuries during his career, including chronic back problems and a shoulder injury during the 1997 season. Young played in 17 of 22 matches in the 1997 home and away rounds in which St Kilda qualified in first position for the 1997 AFL Finals Series, winning the club\u2019s 2nd Minor Premiership and 1st McClelland Trophy. This, and the doubts of St Kilda leadership about his ability to play a whole game meant he was dropped from the side for the 1997 Grand Final. 1999 was another successful season, and he was runner up in the best and fairest, however he struggled during 2000 and was cut from the list at the end of the year. Often considered a strong running defender, many disposal errors marred his career."
