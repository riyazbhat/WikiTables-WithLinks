  "/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes": "The Scheduled Caste (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) are officially designated groups of people in India. The terms are recognised in the Constitution of India and the groups are designated in one or other of the categories. For much of the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent, they were known as the Depressed Classes. In modern literature, the Scheduled Castes are sometimes referred to as Dalit, meaning \"broken/scattered\" in Sanskrit, having been popularised by B. R. Ambedkar (1891\u20131956), the economist, reformer, father of the Indian Constitution, and Dalit leader during the independence struggle, himself a Dalit. Ambedkar preferred the term Dalit to Gandhi's term, Harijan, meaning \"person of Hari/Vishnu\" (or Man of God). In September 2018, the government \"issued an advisory to all private satellite channels asking them to 'refrain' from using the nomenclature 'Dalit'\", though \"rights groups and intellectuals have come out against any shift from 'Dalit' in popular usage\". The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes comprise about 16.6% and 8.6%, respectively, of India's population (according to the 2011 census). The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 lists 1,108 castes across 29 states in its First Schedule, and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 lists 744 tribes across 22 states in its First Schedule.",
