  "/wiki/Light_Sky_Blue": "Sky blue is a colour that resembles the colour of the unclouded sky at noon (azure) reflecting off a metallic surface. The entry for \"sky-blue\" in Murray's New English Dictionary (1919) reports a first sighting of the term in the article on \"silver\" in Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia of 1728. However, many writers had used the term \"sky blue\" to name a colour before Chambers. For example, we find \"sky blue\" in A Collection of Voyages and Travels (London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1704), vol. 2, p. 322, where John Nieuhoff describes certain flowers: \"they are of a lovely sky blue colour, and yellow in the middle\". \nThe sense of this colour may have been first used in 1585 in a book by Nicolas de  Nicolay where he stated \"the tulbant[clarification needed] of the merchant must be skie coloured\".",
  "/wiki/Orange_(colour)": "Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, created by mixing yellow and red. It is named after the fruit of the same name. The orange colour of carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, oranges, and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes, a type of photosynthetic pigment. These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants' growth. Similarly the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed. In Europe and America, surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement, the unconventional, extroverts, warmth, fire, energy, activity, danger, taste and aroma, the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons, as well as having long been the national colour of the Netherlands and the House of Orange.",
  "/wiki/Black": "Black is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, a color without hue, like white and gray. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness, while white represents light. Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates, including the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings. In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.",
  "/wiki/White": "White is the lightest color and is achromatic (having no hue). It is the color of fresh snow, chalk and milk, and is the opposite of black. White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light. White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue and green light. In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States.",

Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land, situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles (160 km) from Sydney, would be ceded to the new federal government. Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales, the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911, two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913.

The matches are usually played in the Northern Territory, either at Marrara Oval in Darwin or Traeger Park in Alice Springs. The AFL promotes the concept as recognition of the indigenous Australians' contribution to the national competition, with approximately one in ten AFL players identifying as an Indigenous Australian. The AFL has been criticised for letting its clubs prevent the All-Stars from selecting its top Indigenous senior players, or for placing restrictions on their game time.

Initially serving a primarily administrative function, the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896. The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL. From 1897 until 1995, the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria's secondary senior club competition. Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL, the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules, and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays.",
  "/wiki/Western_Australia_Australian_rules_football_team": "The Western Australia Australian rules football team is the state representative side of Western Australia in the sport of Australian rules football.\n Western Australia has a proud history in interstate football, having a successful historical record and winning three Australian Championships and a State of Origin Carnival Championship, in the State of Origin era.\n Western Australia has a long and intense rivalry with Victoria. The 1986 game between Western Australia and Victoria is \"regarded by many people as one of the greatest games \u2013 not just in State of Origin \u2013 but in the 150 years of Australian Football\".\n The rivalry with Victoria stems from before State of Origin started clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL), being the richest league, used to sign many of the best players from interstate and the standard rules prior to 1977 were that all VFL players played interstate football for Victoria. Also contributing a feeling in Western Australia that Victoria never gave them the credit they deserve, despite some of the best players of all time coming from the state. The rivalry with Victoria is characterised in the West Coast Eagles first song, with the line \"for years they took the best of us and claimed them for their own, but now we've got them back again\", referring to the VFL making Western Australian players play for Victoria.",
  "/wiki/Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football": "Australian rules football matches between teams representing Australian colonies, states and territories have been held since 1879. For most of the 20th century, the absence of a national club competition and international matches meant that football games between state representative teams were regarded with great importance. Football historian John Devaney has argued that: \"some of the state of origin contests which took place during the 1980s constituted arguably the finest expositions of the game ever seen\". Until 1976, interstate Australian rules football games were played by teams representing the major football leagues or organisations. From 1977 to 1999, players were generally selected under State of Origin selection rules and they were chosen mostly from the Australian Football League (AFL). Since 2000, all matches have been between teams representing the second-tier state or territorial leagues. Players from the AFL no longer take part in interstate matches. The matches have mostly been held on a stand-alone basis."
