  "/wiki/Light_Sky_Blue": "Sky blue is a colour that resembles the colour of the unclouded sky at noon (azure) reflecting off a metallic surface. The entry for \"sky-blue\" in Murray's New English Dictionary (1919) reports a first sighting of the term in the article on \"silver\" in Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia of 1728. However, many writers had used the term \"sky blue\" to name a colour before Chambers. For example, we find \"sky blue\" in A Collection of Voyages and Travels (London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1704), vol. 2, p.\u00a0322, where John Nieuhoff describes certain flowers: \"they are of a lovely sky blue colour, and yellow in the middle\". \nThe sense of this colour may have been first used in 1585 in a book by Nicolas de  Nicolay where he stated \"the tulbant[clarification needed] of the merchant must be skie coloured\".",
