Technically, crossbreed dogs, and \"designer dogs\" while also a mix of breeds, differ from mongrels in being intentionally bred.

After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned, such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions. Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States, it still exists as an underground activity, and pit bulls are a common type used.",
