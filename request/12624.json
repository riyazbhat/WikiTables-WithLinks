  "/wiki/Al-Yarmouk_SC_(Kuwait)": "Al-Yarmouk is a Kuwaiti professional sports club located in the district of Mishref. It was established on 28 February 1965 in Failaka Island and was the only Kuwaiti club to have been established outside mainland Kuwait at that time. The club was relocated to mainland Kuwait after the 1990-1991 Gulf War, which resulted in the displacement of many inhabitants belonging to Failaka's island settlements. Therefore, due to inadequate facilities after the liberation of Kuwait, it was inevitable that the team had to move to a better and more sustainable location. Other reasons, aside the Gulf War, for the relocation of the club was due to the insufficient means of transportation for teams and players to travel to Failaka Island for away matches during the regular season. Al Yarmouk is mostly famous for its football team, which gave rise to a plethora of talented Kuwaiti football players during the course of its history. The club has only achieved 4 trophies since it was first established, 2 of which were the Prince Cups in 1970 and 1973, which is usually regarded as the most prestigious and important trophy in Kuwaiti football. The other 2 trophy achievements were the Second division titles won in 1968 and 1989. Al Yarmouk sports club went through a major renovation project since 2006, as part of a grand scheme to regenerate interest within the local Mishref community. A new stadium was built and is also planned for a second phase of renovation. Al Yarmouk also built new swimming facilities as well as an indoor arena for basketball, handball, volleyball and other indoor sports such as table tennis. A track and field team is also widely financed from the club's department."
