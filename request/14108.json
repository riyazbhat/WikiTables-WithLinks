More commonly, it is used narrowly to refer to the Athabaskan speakers of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut in Canada, especially including the Chipewyan (Denesuline), Tlicho (Dogrib), Yellowknives (T'atsaot'ine), Slavey (Deh Gah Got'ine or Deh Cho), and Sahtu (the Eastern group in Jeff Leer's classification; part of the Northwestern Canada group in Keren Rice's classification). But it is sometimes also used to refer to all Northern Athabaskan speakers, who are spread in a wide range all across Alaska and northern Canada.  Note that Den\u00e9 never includes the Pacific Coast Athabaskan or Southern Athabaskan speakers in the continental U.S.,[citation needed] despite the fact that the term is used to denote the Athabaskan languages as a whole (the Na-Dene language family).
