She worked in the Town Clerk's department for 17 years prior to the 1964 Summer Paralympics.

She was among the first sixteen gold medal athletes from Victoria, winning four gold medals at these games. Her success led to selection of one of only two Victorian athletes of the 15 member Australian team, to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics. At these games, she won Australia's fourth gold medal in the women's club throw A class event with a throw of 17.31 metres, a silver medal in the women's javelin A event with a throw of 9.26 metres, and a bronze medal in the women's table tennis singles B class event.

At the Fourth Australian Paraplegic Games held in Brisbane Queensland, April 1966, Schreiber won seven gold medals in field events and table tennis, breaking the world record in precision javelin throw.\n Following these games, Schreiber set her sights on the British Commonwealth Paraplegic Games, held in Kingston, Jamaica in 1966.
