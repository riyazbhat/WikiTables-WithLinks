  "/wiki/NY_31": "New York State Route 31 (NY 31) is a state highway that extends for 208.74 miles (335.93 km) across western and central New York in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 104 in the city of Niagara Falls. Its eastern terminus is at a traffic circle with NY 26 in Vernon Center, a hamlet within the town of Vernon. Over its routing, NY 31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in Upstate New York: Buffalo\u2013Niagara Falls, Rochester, and Syracuse. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, NY 104 to the north and NY 5 to the south, as well as the Erie Canal, as it proceeds east.\n Much of NY 31 west of Jordan was originally designated as part of a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY 31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route 30 (modern NY 31, NY 429, and NY 104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to Lenox. At Lenox, NY 31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY 316 and NY 46 to NY 5 in Oneida. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue east to Utica via Verona. With the advent of U.S. Route 104 (US 104) c.\u20091935, NY 31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n NY 31 was truncated westward to NY 365 in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY 31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of New York State Route 234, a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY 234 was transferred from the state of New York to Oneida County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY 234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY 234 became an extension of NY 31.",

The southern terminus is at the state line in the Chemung County town of Ashland, where it continues south as Pennsylvania Route 14 (PA 14). Its northern terminus is at a cul-de-sac on Greig Street in the Wayne County village of Sodus Point. NY 14 has direct connections with every major east\u2013west highway in western New York, including Interstate 86 (I-86) and NY 17, U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5, and the New York State Thruway (I-90). It passes through two cities\u2014Elmira and Geneva\u2014and serves many villages as it traverses the state.\n NY 14 was assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Elmira to Sodus Point via Watkins Glen, Penn Yan, and Geneva. It was extended south to Pennsylvania by 1926 and realigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow its modern routing alongside Seneca Lake between Watkins Glen and Geneva. Its former routing via Penn Yan became NY 14A, NY 14's lone suffixed route. While the general routing of NY 14 has not changed since 1930, it has been realigned several times within the Elmira area. When it was first assigned, it used several different city streets, including Broadway, Main Street in Elmira, Lake Street, and Main Street in Horseheads. It was gradually reconfigured into its current routing over the years, with the last change coming c.\u20092004 when the route was shifted onto most of the Clemens Center Parkway.\n The portion of NY 14 on Corning Road and College Avenue in Horseheads and Elmira has had several designations over the years.

The route spans a total of three counties, connecting the heart of the Finger Lakes Region to a point 6 miles (10 km) south of Lake Ontario. Along the way, NY 89 intersects two regionally important highways: the conjoined routes of U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5 in Seneca Falls and NY 31 in Savannah. NY 89 runs along the western edge of Cayuga Lake from Ithaca to Seneca Falls.\n NY 89 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a significantly different alignment than it follows today. At the time, the route began in Varick and passed through Seneca Falls and Clyde before ending near North Rose. It was extended south to Ithaca c.\u20091933 and rerouted north of Seneca Falls on April 30, 1959 to serve Savannah and Wolcott instead. The latter change supplanted part of NY 414, which was subsequently moved onto NY 89's original routing from Seneca Falls to North Rose. NY 89 originally extended into the village of Wolcott; however, it was cut back to its current northern terminus after the NY 104 super two was constructed in the early 1970s.",
  "/wiki/List_of_county_routes_in_Wayne_County,_New_York": "County routes in Wayne County, New York, are only posted on street blade signs. Each route number is the product of two different numbering systems, both county-wide in nature. The last two digits of the route number serve as a road's base designation and are assigned sequentially from the Monroe County line in the west to the Cayuga County line in the east and from the Lake Ontario shoreline in the north to the Ontario and Seneca county lines in the south. The first digit of each route's designation indicates where the route is located: routes numbered in the 100s are north of Ridge Road; routes in the 200s are south of Ridge Road and north of New York State Route 31 (NY 31); and routes in the 300s are south of NY 31. If a road crosses either of those highways, the first digit of the route's number changes to reflect the road's location in the latter numbering grid.\n Routes ending in an even number run from north to south; routes with an odd designation travel from east to west."
