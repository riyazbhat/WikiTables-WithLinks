  "/wiki/Pol_Pot": "Pol Pot[a] (born Saloth S\u00e2r;[b] 19 May 1925 \u2013 15 April 1998) was a Cambodian revolutionary and politician who governed Cambodia as the Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea between 1975 and 1979. Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist and Khmer nationalist, he was a leading member of Cambodia's communist movement, the Khmer Rouge, from 1963 until 1997 and served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a one-party communist state governed according to Pol Pot's interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.\n Born to a prosperous farmer in Prek Sbauv, French Cambodia, Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. While in Paris during the 1940s, he joined the French Communist Party. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist\u2013Leninist Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh organisation and its guerrilla war against King Norodom Sihanouk's newly independent government. Following the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled North Vietnam, Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh, working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he re-launched the war against Sihanouk's government. After Lon Nol deposed Sihanouk in a 1970 coup, Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against Lon Nol's government, which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.\n Pol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an agrarian socialist society that he believed would evolve into a communist society, Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on collective farms. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the Cambodian genocide. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot's government in 1979. The Vietnamese installed a rival Marxist\u2013Leninist faction opposed to Pol Pot which renamed the country the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Pol Pot and his supporters retreated to a jungle base near the border with Thailand. The Ta Mok faction placed Pol Pot under house arrest, where he died in 1998, possibly from suicide.\n Taking power in Cambodia at the height of Marxism-Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement. Many claimed he deviated from orthodox Marxism-Leninism although China backed his government as a bulwark against Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. For his supporters, he was a champion of Cambodian sovereignty in the face of Vietnamese imperialism and stood against the Marxist revisionism of the Soviet Union. Conversely, he has been internationally denounced for his role in the Cambodian genocide, regarded as a totalitarian dictator guilty of crimes against humanity.",

Keo Meas, then a fourth-year student at the Phnom Penh Teachers Training College, was recruited to the Indochinese Communist Party by Son Sichan in 1946. In 1950, he became a leading figure within the United Issarak Front. At the same time he was a leading figure in the Phnom Penh city unit of the ICP.\n Keo Meas was involved in the reorganization of the city party unit, after it had been broken up by arrests in July 1952. In December the same year, he represented the UIF at the People's Peace Conference in Vienna.\n When the Cambodian parts of the ICP were converted to the Khmer People's Revolutionary Party in 1954, Keo Meas became the leader of the Phnom Penh unit of the new party. After the cessation of hostilities in the same year, Keo Meas was one of the representatives of the UIF in the Viet Minh side of the Joint Commission for the Implementation of the Geneva Accords.\n As the KPRP was an underground party, Keo Meas, Non Suon and Penn Yuth were assigned to form a legal front of the party.

It is believed that Keo Meas was part of this committee, although there are also reports that Saloth Sar (Pol Pot) would have been the fourth member of the committee instead.\n At the time of the March 1958 parliamentary election, the Krom Pracheachon only dared to put up five candidates. Keo Meas stood in a Phnom Penh constituency. However, due to the harsh political climate, Keo Meas was the only Krom Pracheachon candidate able to run any campaign work at all. Official results gave Keo Meas 396 votes. Soon after the election, Keo Meas went underground and left the city. The secretaryship of the Phnom Penh party unit was passed on to Saloth Sar.\n In 1960, as the KPRP held its second congress, Keo Meas was included into the party Central Committee.

  "/wiki/Norodom_Sihanouk": "Norodom Sihanouk (Khmer: \u1793\u179a\u17c4\u178f\u17d2\u178f\u1798 \u179f\u17b8\u17a0\u1793\u17bb; 31 October 1922 \u2013 15 October 2012) was head of state of Cambodia numerous times. In Cambodia, he is known as Samdech Euv (Khmer: \u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178f\u17c1\u1785\u17aa, father prince). During his lifetime Cambodia was variously called the French Protectorate of Cambodia (until 1953), the Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u201370), the Khmer Republic (1970\u201375), Democratic Kampuchea (1975\u201379), the People's Republic of Kampuchea (1979\u201393), and again the Kingdom of Cambodia (from 1993).\n Sihanouk became king of Cambodia in 1941 upon the death of his maternal grandfather, King Monivong. After the Japanese occupation of Cambodia during the Second World War, he secured Cambodian independence from France. He abdicated in 1955 and was succeeded by his father, Suramarit. Sihanouk's political organization Sangkum won the general elections that year and he became prime minister of Cambodia. He governed it under one-party rule, suppressed political dissent, and declared himself Head of State in 1960. Officially neutral in foreign relations, in practice he was closer to the communist bloc. The Cambodian coup of 1970 ousted him and he fled to China and North Korea, there forming a government-in-exile and resistance movement. He encouraged Cambodians to fight the new government and backed the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian Civil War. He returned as figurehead head of state after the Khmer Rouge's victory in 1975. His relations with the new government declined and in 1976 he resigned. He was placed under house arrest until Vietnamese forces overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979.\n Sihanouk went into exile again and in 1981 formed FUNCINPEC, a resistance party. The following year, he became president of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), a broad coalition of anti-Vietnamese resistance factions which retained Cambodia's seat at the United Nations, making him Cambodia's internationally recognized head of state. In the late 1980s, informal talks were carried out to end hostilities between the Vietnam-supported People's Republic of Kampuchea and the CGDK. In 1990, the Supreme National Council of Cambodia was formed as a transitional body to oversee Cambodia's sovereign matters, with Sihanouk as its president. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords were signed and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was established the following year. The UNTAC organized the 1993 Cambodian general elections, and a coalition government, jointly led by his son Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, was subsequently formed. He was reinstated as Cambodia's king. He abdicated again in 2004 and the Royal Council of the Throne chose his son, Sihamoni, as his successor. Sihanouk died in Beijing in 2012.\n Between 1941 and 2006, Sihanouk produced and directed 50 films, some of which he acted in. The films, later described as being of low quality, often featured nationalistic elements, as did a number of the songs he wrote. Some of his songs were about his wife Queen Monique, the nations neighboring Cambodia, and the communist leaders who supported him in his exile. In the 1980s Sihanouk held concerts for diplomats in New York City. He also participated in concerts at his palace during his second reign.",
