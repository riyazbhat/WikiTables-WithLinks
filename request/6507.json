Several Czech athletes, however, missed out of medal standings in the finals, including rifle shooter and defending champion Kate\u0159ina Emmons, and javelin thrower V\u00edt\u011bzslav Vesel\u00fd.\n For the first time in its history, the Czech House (located in the Business Design Centre in borough of Islington) had become accessible to the public (i.e. not only the team members and VIPs), attracting over 78,000 visitors during the Olympics. In a brief comparison of selected national centres, AP news agency even awarded this project an imaginary \"gold medal\". A moving sculpture by David \u010cern\u00fd named London Booster (a life-sized London double-decker bus doing push-ups with humanoid arms) was a major feature outside the Czech House. Meanwhile, Czech presentation relied heavily on eccentricity. For example, the official outfit, in which Czech athletes paraded during the opening ceremonies (and some also entered podiums), featured bright blue Wellington boots (a pun on the stereotypically unstable British weather)."
