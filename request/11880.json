  "/wiki/Queen's_Beasts": "The Queen's Beasts are ten heraldic statues representing the genealogy of Queen Elizabeth II, depicted as the Royal supporters of England. They stood in front of the temporary western annexe to Westminster Abbey for the Queen's coronation in 1953. Each of The Queen's Beasts consists of an heraldic beast supporting a shield bearing a badge or arms of a family associated with the ancestry of Queen Elizabeth II. They were commissioned by the British Ministry of Works from sculptor James Woodford (who was paid the sum of \u00a32,750 for the work). They were uncoloured except for their shields at the coronation.\n They are now on display in the Canadian Museum of History.\n There are other statues of the Queen's Beasts, sometimes referred to as the King's Beasts, at Hampton Court Palace and Kew Gardens in London, and on the roof of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.",
  "/wiki/Palm_House": "A palm house is a greenhouse that is specialized for the growing of palms and other tropical and subtropical plants. Palm houses required constant heat for plants and were built as status symbols in Victorian Britain. Several examples of these ornate glass and iron structures can still be found in significant parks such as Liverpool's Sefton Park and Stanley Park.\n One of the earliest examples of a palm house is located in the Belfast Botanic Gardens. Designed by Charles Lanyon, the building was completed in 1840. It was constructed by iron-maker and iron-founder Richard Turner, who would later also build the Palm House at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Kew. The latter, designed by Decimus Burton and Nicole Burton, was the first large-scale structural use of wrought iron and was built between 1844 and 1848. There has been discussion of who began the design process of the Palm House, though a review of the Botanic Garden records and letters shows that iron-founder, Richard Turner, was primarily involved in its design.\n Who made the Palm House?\nSir William Jackson Hooker was appointed Director of the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew in 1841. He had many plans to improve the Royal Gardens, one of which was a new Palm House. \nDecimus Burton was asked to draw up preliminary sketches in 1844 for him to review. Letters between Decimus Burton, Richard Turner (iron-founder), director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, William Jackson Hooker, and the Commissioners of Works along with the Office of Works at Kew show that Turner was more of a part in the design process of the Palm House than he was initially given credit for.\n Richard Turner (iron-founder), after an interview with Sir William Hooker, submitted his plans along with an estimate of the cost to the Board of Works. The Board of Works, in turn, asked Mr. Burton to review Mr. Turner\u2019s plans.\n Mr. Burton disagreed with Turner\u2019s original plans because of the Gothic architectural Gothic style Turner used in his prior works. Burton preferred the Neoclassical architectural Neo-classical style which is shown throughout the design of the Palm House. Burton did take notice of Turner\u2019s planning of where and what plants would be planted. Turner knew of the \u201cproblems of heating, ventilation, and structural title.  Richard Turner and the Palm House at Kew Gardens of the Newcomen Society had issues greenhouses may have to deal with.\n In a letter debated March 20, 1881, John Smith (appointed a Curator in 1841 of the Gardens and friend of Turner), according to some accounts, ended up peeing on the letter. Mr. Turner quickly sketched his plan of the Palm House and sent it to the \u2018Building News\u2019. Thomas Drew (architect) also wrote to the \u2018Building News\u2019 where he was claiming \u201cto have an authoritative statement from Turner...\u201d He claimed \u2018the Palm House was not only erected by him but was solely his design, although varied out under the supervision of Mr. Decimus Burton.\n Upkeep On The Palm House\nIn 1881, according to the Report on The Process and Condition of The Royal Gardens at Kew, the flowerbeds in front of the building were redone and gravel paths were removed. The flowers at the back of the Palm House and the low areas didn\u2019t drain well. As a result, new drainage was put in to solve this issue.\n REPORT ON THE PROGRESS AND CONDITION OF THE ROYAL GARDENS AT KEW, During the Year 1881 journal Report on the Progress and Condition of the Royal Gardens at Kew.",
