  "/wiki/Queen's_Beasts": "The Queen's Beasts are ten heraldic statues representing the genealogy of Queen Elizabeth II, depicted as the Royal supporters of England. They stood in front of the temporary western annexe to Westminster Abbey for the Queen's coronation in 1953. Each of The Queen's Beasts consists of an heraldic beast supporting a shield bearing a badge or arms of a family associated with the ancestry of Queen Elizabeth II. They were commissioned by the British Ministry of Works from sculptor James Woodford (who was paid the sum of \u00a32,750 for the work). They were uncoloured except for their shields at the coronation. They are now on display in the Canadian Museum of History. There are other statues of the Queen's Beasts, sometimes referred to as the King's Beasts, at Hampton Court Palace and Kew Gardens in London, and on the roof of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.",
  "/wiki/Palm_House": "A palm house is a greenhouse that is specialized for the growing of palms and other tropical and subtropical plants. Palm houses required constant heat for plants and were built as status symbols in Victorian Britain. Several examples of these ornate glass and iron structures can still be found in significant parks such as Liverpool's Sefton Park and Stanley Park. One of the earliest examples of a palm house is located in the Belfast Botanic Gardens. Designed by Charles Lanyon, the building was completed in 1840. It was constructed by iron-maker and iron-founder Richard Turner, who would later also build the Palm House at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Kew. The latter, designed by Decimus Burton and Nicole Burton, was the first large-scale structural use of wrought iron and was built between 1844 and 1848. There has been discussion of who began the design process of the Palm House, though a review of the Botanic Garden records and letters shows that iron-founder, Richard Turner, was primarily involved in its design.",
