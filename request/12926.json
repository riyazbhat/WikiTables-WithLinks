  "/wiki/Mario_Bava": "Mario Bava (31 July 1914 \u2013 27 April 1980) was an Italian filmmaker who worked variously as a director, screenwriter, cinematographer, and special effects artist. He is frequently referred to as the Master of Italian Horror and the Master of the Macabre. His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature. Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as Hercules (1958) and its sequel Hercules Unchained (1959) (each were lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000). During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including I Vampiri (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), The Day the Sky Exploded (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), Caltiki \u2013 The Immortal Monster (1959) and The Giant of Marathon (1959). Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres: Black Sunday (1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle; The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963) is considered to be the first giallo film; Kill, Baby, Kill (1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror; Roy Colt & Winchester Jack (1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns; Four Times That Night (1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and A Bay of Blood (1971) was a precursor to slasher films.

She made her musical debut in the early 1960s on Disques Vogue and found immediate success with her song Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles. As a leading figure of the y\u00e9-y\u00e9 movement, Hardy found herself at the very forefront of the French music scene, and became France's most exportable female singing star, recording in various languages, appearing in movies, touring throughout Europe, and gaining plaudits from musicians such as Bob Dylan, Miles Davis and Mick Jagger. With the aid of photographer Jean-Marie P\u00e9rier, Hardy also began modeling, and soon became a popular fashion icon as well. As the y\u00e9-y\u00e9 era drew to a close in the late 1960s, Hardy sought to reinvent herself, casting off the fashionable girl next door image that P\u00e9rier had created for her and abandoning the cute and catchy compositions that had characterized her repertoire up to that point. She began working with more accomplished songwriters such as Serge Gainsbourg and Patrick Modiano. Her 1971 album La question represented an important turning point in her career, moving towards a more mature style; it remains her most acclaimed work and has generated a dedicated cult following over the years. The early 1970s also marked the beginning of Hardy's renowned involvement with astrology, becoming an expert and writer on the subject over the years.",
