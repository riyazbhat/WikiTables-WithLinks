  "/wiki/Bacteroides": "Bacteroides is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic bacteria. Bacteroides species are non endospore-forming bacilli, and may be either motile or nonmotile, depending on the species. The DNA base composition is 40\u201348% GC. Unusual in bacterial organisms, Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids. They also contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan layer.",
  "/wiki/Bacteroides_fragilis": "Bacteroides fragilis is an obligately anaerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium.  It is part of the normal microbiota of the human colon and is generally commensal, but can cause infection if displaced into the bloodstream or surrounding tissue following surgery, disease, or trauma.",
  "/wiki/Bacteroidetes": "The phylum Bacteroidetes is composed of three large classes of Gram-negative, nonsporeforming, anaerobic or aerobic, and rod-shaped bacteria that are widely distributed in the environment, including in soil, sediments, and sea water, as well as in the guts and on the skin of animals.",
  "/wiki/Bacteroides_thetaiotaomicron": "Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (formerly Bacillus thetaiotaomicron) is a species of bacterium of the genus Bacteroides. It is a gram-negative obligate anaerobe. It is one of the most common bacteria found in human gut flora and is also an opportunistic pathogen. Its genome contains numerous genes apparently specialized in digestion of polysaccharides.",
  "/wiki/Chlorobi": "The green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) are a family of obligately anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria. Together with the non-photosynthetic Ignavibacteriaceae, they form the phylum Chlorobi.",
  "/wiki/DOE_Joint_Genome_Institute": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI), first located in Walnut Creek then Berkeley, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). As a DOE Office of Science User Facility of Berkeley Lab, the JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The JGI also collaborates with other DOE-supported programs and facilities, such as the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, or NERSC, and the DOE Bioenergy Research Centers.",
  "/wiki/Chlorobium": "Chlorobium (also known as Chlorochromatium) is a genus of green sulfur bacteria. They are photolithotrophic oxidizers of sulfur and most notably utilise a noncyclic electron transport chain to reduce NAD+. Photosynthesis is achieved using a Type 1 Reaction Centre using bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a. Two photosynthetic antenna complexes aid in light absorption: the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex (\"FMO\", also containing BChl a), and the chlorosomes which employ mostly BChl c, d, or e. Hydrogen sulfide is used as an electron source and carbon dioxide its carbon source.",
  "/wiki/Chlorobium_chlorochromatii": "Chlorobium chlorochromatii, originally known as Chlorobium aggregatum, is a symbiotic green sulfur bacteria that performs anoxygenic photosynthesis and functions as an obligate photoautotroph using reduced sulfur species as electron donors. Chlorobium chlorochromatii can be found in stratified freshwater lakes.",
  "/wiki/Chlorobium_tepidum": "Chlorobium tepidum is an anaerobic, thermophilic green sulfur bacteria first isolated from New Zealand. Cells are gram-negative and non-motile rods of variable length. They contain bacteriochlorophyll c and chlorosomes.",
  "/wiki/Cytophaga": "Cytophaga is a genus of Gram-negative, gliding, rod-shaped bacteria. This  bacterium is commonly found in soil, rapidly digests crystalline cellulose  C. hutchinsonii is able to use its gliding motility to move quickly over surfaces.  Although the mechanism for this is not known, there is a belief that the flagella is not used",
  "/wiki/Porphyromonas": "Porphyromonas is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic and non-motile genus from the family of Porphyromonadaceae. This genus has been found to be part of the salivary microbiome. The use of targeted 16S rRNA gene metagenomic sequencing has shown that the genus is well represented in healthy individuals from the Human Microbiome Project.",
  "/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis": "Porphyromonas gingivalis belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is a nonmotile, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, anaerobic, pathogenic bacterium. It forms black colonies on blood agar.",
  "/wiki/List_of_sequenced_bacterial_genomes": "This list of sequenced eubacterial genomes contains most of the eubacteria known to have publicly available complete genome sequences. Most of these sequences have been placed in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, a public database which can be searched on the web. A few of the listed genomes may not be in the INSDC database, but in other public databases[verification needed]."
