  "/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle_(song)": "Message in a Bottle is a song by English rock band The Police. It was released as the lead single from their second studio album, Reggatta de Blanc (1979). Written by the band's lead singer and bassist Sting, the song is ostensibly about a story of a castaway on an island, who sends out a message in a bottle to seek love. A year later, he has not received any sort of response, and despairs, thinking he is destined to be alone. The next day, he sees a hundred billion bottles on the shore, finding out that there are more people like him out there. American rock band American Hi-Fi performed a cover of the song for the 2003 film Rugrats Go Wild. The song was the first of their five UK number one singles. Rolling Stone ranked it number 65 on its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.",

Considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S., in 1983 Rolling Stone labelled them the first British New Wave act to break through in America on a grand scale, and possibly the biggest band in the world. The Police disbanded in 1986, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour that ended in August 2008. Their 1978 debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, reached No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart.",

  "/wiki/Spiderwebs": "A spider web, spiderweb, spider's web, or cobweb (from the archaic word coppe, meaning spider) is a structure created by a spider out of proteinaceous spider silk extruded from its spinnerets, generally meant to catch its prey. Spider webs have existed for at least 100 million years, as witnessed in a rare find of Early Cretaceous amber from Sussex, southern England. Many spiders build webs specifically to catch insects to eat. However, not all spiders catch their prey in webs, and some do not build webs at all. Spider web is typically used to refer to a web that is apparently still in use (i.e. clean), whereas cobweb refers to abandoned (i.e. dusty) webs. However, the word cobweb is also used by biologists to describe the tangled three-dimensional web of some spiders of the Theridiidae family.",
