Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation (not to be confused with freerunning).

Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features. Parkour as a type of movement was established by David Belle in the late 1980s, therefore many consider its origin to be France, however this type of movement has also been practiced by people in other European countries like Latvia and Russia during the same period of time.
