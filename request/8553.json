He was a triple Olympic champion, winning the three alpine events at the 1968 Winter Olympics, becoming the most successful athlete there. He also won the first two World Cup titles, in 1967 and 1968.",
  "/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1968_Winter_Olympics": "Alpine skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics consisted of six events, held 9\u201317 February at Chamrousse, southeast of Grenoble, France.\nJean-Claude Killy of France won all three men's events, repeating Toni Sailer's triple-gold of 1956. Since Killy's feat, no male alpine ski racer has won three gold medals in a single Olympics. (Janica Kostelic later won three gold medals in the 2002 Winter Olympics).\n This was the first Olympics with a two-run men's giant slalom, with one run per day. The women's giant slalom was one run until 1980.\n For the only time, the results from Olympic races were included in the World Cup standings, then in its second season.  Following the 1970 season, Olympic and World Championship results were not included in the World Cup points standings.",
  "/wiki/Marielle_Goitschel": "Marielle Goitschel (born 28 September 1945 in Sainte-Maxime) is a former French alpine skier. Marielle is the younger sister of Christine Goitschel, another champion skier of the time, and the aunt of speed skier Philippe Goitschel.\n After great success in the 1962 World Championships and 1964 Winter Olympics, winning 5 medals including 3 golds, Goitschel was considered the world's best female skier.  She continued her domination at the 1966 World Championships in Portillo, Chile, winning medals in all 4 events, with 3 golds and one silver.  When the alpine skiing World Cup debuted a few months after those championships in January 1967, Goitschel was expected to again dominate the circuit that season.  However, she narrowly lost the overall title to Nancy Greene of Canada, but did take the discipline cup in downhill and tied for the win in slalom with her compatriot Annie Famose.  During the next season, she again missed the overall title, finishing only 4th while repeating as slalom champion.  She won her final gold medal in slalom at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, and then retired from ski racing after that season.  Goitschel's total of 11 World Championships medals in alpine skiing is second all-time among women to the 15 won by Christl Cranz of Germany (see the note below).\n Marielle and sister Christine were the first ever female siblings on the same individual's event Olympic podium, winning the gold (Christine) and silver (Marielle) medals in the 1964 Olympic Women's slalom.  They would repeat the feat two days later, switching their gold-silver order, in the 1964 Olympic Women's giant slalom.",
