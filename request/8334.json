  "/wiki/Conference_House": "Conference House (also known as Billop House) is a stone house in Tottenville, Staten Island, New York City built by Captain Christopher Billopp some time before 1680. It is located in Conference House Park near Ward's Point, the southernmost tip of New York State on Staten Island, which became known as Billop's Point in the 18th century.\n The Staten Island Peace Conference, an unsuccessful attempt to find a swift negotiated end to end the American Revolutionary War, was hosted by his heir and grandson Colonel  Christopher Billop, there on September 11, 1776.

The eastern boundary is formed by Richmond Valley Road and Richard Avenue. Originally named Bentley Manor by one of its first settlers, Captain Christopher Billop (1638\u20131726), after a small ship he owned named the Bentley, the district was renamed Tottenville in 1869, apparently in honor of the locally prominent Totten family, whose name can be seen on tombstones in one of the earliest churches, Bethel Methodist Church, on Amboy Road.

  "/wiki/French_Church": "The Catholic Church in France is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the Pope in Rome. Established in the 2nd century in unbroken communion with the bishop of Rome, it is sometimes called the eldest daughter of the church. The first written records of Christians in France date from the 2nd century when Irenaeus detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop Saint Pothinus of Lugdunum (Lyon) and other martyrs of the 177 AD persecution in Lyon. In 496 Remigius baptized King Clovis I, who therefore converted from paganism to  Catholicism. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, forming the political and religious foundations of Christendom in Europe and establishing in earnest the French government's long historical association with the Catholic Church. In reaction, the French Revolution (1789\u20131790) was followed by heavy persecution of the Catholic Church. Since the beginning of the 20th century, La\u00efcit\u00e9, absolute neutrality of the state with respect to religious doctrine, is the official policy of the Republic of France. Estimates of the proportion of Catholics range between 41% and 88% of France's population, with the higher figure including lapsed Catholics and Catholic atheists.",
  "/wiki/Old_Town,_Staten_Island": "Old Town is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island, located on its East Shore. Old Town was established in August 1661 as part of New Netherland, and was the first permanent European settlement on Staten Island. Originally described as Oude Dorpe (old village in Dutch), much of its original territory makes up what is present-day South Beach, with parts of Midland Beach and Dongan Hills.  The area was settled by a group of Dutch, Walloon (from what is now southern Belgium and its borders with France) and French Protestants (Huguenots) led by Walloon Pierre Billiou.",
  "/wiki/Pierre_Billiou": "Pierre Billiou (c.1632 \u2013 c.1702) was a French Huguenot born in Flanders. He was a founder of Old Town in 1661, one of the first permanent settlements on Staten Island, shortly before the Dutch colony of New Netherland became the British Province of New York. The Dutch Colonial home whose construction Billiou began in the 1660s, now known as the Billiou\u2013Stillwell\u2013Perine House, is landmarked as the oldest existing building on Staten Island and one of the oldest buildings in the United States.",

Among its founders was Willem Usselincx (1567\u20131647) and Jess\u00e9 de Forest (1576\u20131624). On 3 June 1621, it was granted a charter for a trade monopoly in the Dutch West Indies by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the largely ephemeral Dutch colonization of the Americas (including New Netherland) in the seventeenth century. From 1624 to 1654, in the context of the Dutch-Portuguese War, the WIC held Portuguese territory in northeast Brazil, but they were ousted from Dutch Brazil following fierce resistance. After several reversals, WIC reorganized and a new charter was granted in 1675, largely on the strength in the Atlantic slave trade.",

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric, although the monarch is the supreme governor. The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century, and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury.\n The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534. The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI's regents, before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip. The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach, and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed:",
