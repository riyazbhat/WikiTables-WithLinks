  "/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters": "The United Nations is headquartered in New York City, in a complex designed by a board of architects led by Wallace Harrison, and built by the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz. The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952. It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, on 17 to 18 acres (6.9 to 7.3 ha) of grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east. The term \"Turtle Bay\" is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole.\n The headquarters holds the seats of the principal organs of the UN, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, but excluding the International Court of Justice, which is seated in the Hague. The United Nations has three additional, subsidiary, regional headquarters, or headquarters districts. These were opened in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1946, Vienna (Austria) in 1980, and Nairobi (Kenya) in 1996. These adjunct offices help represent UN interests, facilitate diplomatic activities, and enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges, but do not contain the seats of major organs.\n Although it is situated in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.\n None of the United Nations' 15 specialized agencies (such as UNESCO) are located at the headquarters.

  "/wiki/White_House": "The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers.\n The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style. Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n The modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture\".",

  "/wiki/Mad_(magazine)": "Mad (stylized as MAD) is an American humor magazine founded in 1952 by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines, launched as a comic book before it became a magazine. It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, as well as the cultural landscape of the 20th century, with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its 1974 circulation peak.\n The magazine, which is the last surviving title from the EC Comics line, publishes satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. Its format is divided into a number of recurring segments such as TV and movie parodies, as well as freeform articles. Mad's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, is typically the focal point of the magazine's cover, with his face often replacing that of a celebrity or character who is lampooned within the issue.\n From 1952 until 2018, Mad published 550 regular issues, as well as hundreds of reprint \"Specials\", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. The magazine's numbering reverted to 1 with its June 2018 issue, coinciding with the magazine's headquarters move to the West Coast. In July 2019, it was widely reported that Mad would end its newsstand distribution after 67 years and be available only through the direct market and subscriptions. Future issues will primarily consist of reprinted material from the magazine's archive. MAD would ultimately satirize people's beliefs that the magazine would actually come to an end in issue #11 (December 2019) as part of its \"20 Dumbest People, Events, and Things of 2019\" feature of that issue: As such, the magazine introduced a new section titled \"Still Dumb After All These Years\" consisting of archived material.",
  "/wiki/Lindsay_Edward": "Lindsay M. Edward (1919\u20132007) was an Australian abstract artist, mosaicist and teacher. He was born in Victoria on 26 August 1919.\n Edward studied at the National Gallery Art School from 1938\u201341 under Charles Wheeler  and W.B. McInnes. For 31 years he was associated with the Art School at the Royal Melbourne Technical College (and former Working Men's College) now known as RMIT, where he had been a student, and where he was  teacher 1947\u20131954, head of painting, 1954\u201367 and head of school 1967\u201379. As head of the art department, Edward set up an initiative for systematically developing the RMIT Art Collection, and to make Australian art more accessible to staff and students. He retired from RMIT in August 1979, after which he made many painting trips to Australia's outback.\n His semi-abstract work was exhibited widely in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth and described by Professor Bernard Smith as \"a perceptive art with its own quiet distinction\". He described his approach to abstraction as simply wanting \"to place sequences of shapes, colours and tones on a surface in an abstract manner, like the notes of a Bach fugue\".\n Edward also undertook mural commissions for the Victoria Housing Commission, and for church mosaic panels. One of his murals made of glass mosaic tiles can be seen on the old State Library of Queensland building at 159 William St, Brisbane. This was the winning entry in an Australia-wide competition for a mural to adorn the walls of the Brisbane Public Library in time for the 100-year celebration of responsible government in Queensland in 1959. On winning the competition in 1958, Edward explained that his mosaic design was not a literal subject but rather a 'basic formation  of organic forms indicating growth and development'. Photographs of the winning mural were exhibited in Melbourne at Gallery A in September 1960, and were thought to \"reveal a quality in design related in strength to figure compositions on Greek pottery\". This mural contributed to the listing of the former State Library Building on the State Heritage Register in 1992. Edward's mural is discussed in the book Monumental Queensland: sign posts on a cultural landscape. A close-up image of the mural taken by Graham de Gruchy can be seen at the UQ eSpace Library.\n Edward had around 20 solo exhibitions of his work between 1944-1993. In the 1950s he showed paintings at many Melbourne galleries, including  Stanley Coe Gallery, Peter Bray Gallery, the Victorian Artists' Society Galleries, and Gallery A.  In the 1970s he exhibited in other Melbourne galleries - the Warehouse Galleries, Realities Galleries and Powell St Gallery and in the 1980s and 1990s at David Ellis and the Eastgate Galleries in Hawthorn. In Sydney he exhibited at the Holdsworth Gallery and in Perth, the Quentin Gallery. He also exhibited at the RMIT Gallery in October 1979 on the occasion of his retirement.\n His work is held in numerous collections, including the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, ArtBank, and several regional and tertiary galleries in Victoria, including RMIT.\n Lindsay Edward died on 9 January 2007.

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria (abbreviated as Vic) is a state in south-eastern Australia.  Victoria is Australia's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state (after New South Wales), making it the most densely populated state. Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city, Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city. Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south,[note 1] New South Wales to the north, the Tasman Sea (a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean) to the east, and South Australia to the west.\n The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups, including the Boon wurrung, the Bratauolung, the Djadjawurrung, the Gunai/Kurnai, the Gunditjmara, the Taungurong, the Wathaurong, the Wurundjeri, and the Yorta Yorta. There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia. The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state.\n With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788, Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales.  The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District, an administrative division of New South Wales. Named in honour of Queen Victoria, who signed the division's separation from New South Wales, the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855.\nThe Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia.  Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.\n Politically, Victoria has 38 seats in the Australian House of Representatives and 12 seats in the Australian Senate. At state level, the Parliament of Victoria consists of the Legislative Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house). The Labor Party, led by Daniel Andrews as premier, has governed Victoria since 2014. The personal representative of the Queen of Australia in the state is the Governor of Victoria, currently Linda Dessau (in office since 2015). Victoria is divided into 79 municipal districts, including 33 cities, although a number of unincorporated areas still exist, which the state administers directly.\n The economy of Victoria is highly diversified, with service sectors including financial and property services, health, education, wholesale, retail, hospitality, and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment. Victoria's total gross state product (GSP) ranks second in Australia, although Victoria ranks sixth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity. Culturally, Melbourne hosts a number of museums, art galleries, and theatres, and is also described as the world's sporting capital. The Melbourne Cricket Ground, the largest stadium in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere, hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The ground is also considered the \"spiritual home\" of Australian cricket and Australian rules football, and hosts the grand final of the Australian Football League (AFL) each year, drawing crowds of approximately 100,000.

He was trained at the Wimbledon School of Art and, after moving back to Australia in 1948, at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. In the early to mid 1960s he worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as the host on Bush Quest with Robin Hill. Helping to pioneer this television documentary on Australian wildlife with the producer Ken Taylor, Hill used his serious knowledge and love of birds to observe the local bird and wild life across various bush and wetlands of Victoria. Bush Quest with Robin Hill featured Hill describing the Victorian birdlife in an often improvised and poetic style as well as painting particular birds in water colours that he had observed during the making of each episode. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced a total of six thirty-minute episodes all in black and white. During this period of the 1960s as well as producing and exhibiting his paintings Hill was commissioned by a popular biscuit company to produce paintings for biscuit tins. These tins featured Hill's paintings of birds and circulated commercially within Australia at the time. Robin Hill's granddaughter is the Australian video artist Adelle Mills.\n Hill moved to the United States in 1971, where he established studios in Virginia and Washington D.C.

  "/wiki/Windsor_Castle": "Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire.  It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture.\n The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by early 20th century art historian Hugh Roberts as \"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\" design.\n Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames, Windsor Castle was built as a motte-and-bailey, with three wards surrounding a central mound. Gradually replaced with stone fortifications, the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons' War at the start of the 13th century. Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century, and Edward III went further, rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become \"the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England\". Edward's core design lasted through the Tudor period, during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment.\n Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War, when it was used as a military headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I. At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May, creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired. After a period of neglect during the 18th century, George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the current design of the State Apartments, full of Rococo, Gothic and Baroque furnishings. Queen Victoria made a few minor changes to the castle, which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was used as a refuge by the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992. It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the preferred weekend home of Queen Elizabeth II.",

It is made up of over one million objects, including 7,000 paintings, over 150,000 works on paper, this including 30,000 watercolours and drawings, and about 450,000 photographs, as well as tapestries, furniture, ceramics, textiles, carriages, weapons, armour, jewellery, clocks, musical instruments, tableware, plants, manuscripts, books, and sculptures.\n Some of the buildings which house the collection, like Hampton Court Palace, are open to the public and not lived in by the Royal Family, whilst others, like Windsor Castle and Kensington Palace, are both residences and open to the public. The Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace in London was built specially to exhibit pieces from the collection on a rotating basis. There is a similar art gallery next to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and a Drawings Gallery at Windsor Castle. The Crown Jewels are on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.\n About 3,000 objects are on loan to museums throughout the world, and many others are lent on a temporary basis to exhibitions.",

  "/wiki/Jennifer_Joseph": "Jennifer Joseph (born 1949) is a Melbourne-based artist whose work aligns closely with the aestheticism of the Abstract art movement. In 1971 Joseph received her diploma of Arts and Crafts from Melbourne Teachers' College. She went on to study Fine Art part-time at RMIT University, Australia between 1977 until 1979. Despite her foray with art school and education, Joseph considers herself essentially self-taught.\n In order to work within the realm of the abstract and lucid, Joseph lives nocturnally. The meditative quality of Joseph\u2019s work is achieved through working with ephemeral materials and mediums, such as graphite, linen, wood, viscous acrylic paint, paper, and \u2018found objects\u2019, that she often combines together with elements of drawing and collage. Her creative process involves sitting for many hours contemplating materials, emotions and potential works, and when she is focused and deeply concentrated she executes each work at great speed. For Joseph the process of making art is synonymous with the instinctual nature of life.",

  "/wiki/Barry_Kay": "Barry Kay (1932 \u2013 1985) was an Australian-born stage and costume designer of international renown. After having studied painting at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris and theatre design in Melbourne, he settled in London in 1956. In the course of his career, lasting almost four decades, he designed for the ballet, opera and theatre alike, working with established directors and choreographers at major theatres and opera houses and their companies worldwide.\n Kay's emphasis lay in pioneering three-dimensional stage set designs for the ballet. By breaking away from the traditional use of \"flat wings\" scenery, in designing for the theatre he expanded on the revolutionary ideas of the Russian Constructivists and the Italian Futurists in the early part of the 20th century.\n Among others, he designed for the choreographers Walter Gore, Peter Darrell, Kenneth MacMillan and Rudolf Nureyev, as well as for ballet companies such as Western Theatre Ballet (now Scottish Ballet), The Royal Ballet, The Australian Ballet, the Ballet of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Stuttgart Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet, Le Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris and American Ballet Theatre.\n Some of the drama and opera directors for whom he worked included Margaret Webster, Colin Graham, John Copley, Peter Dews and Rudolf Hartmann - with productions staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Old Vic, London; Sadler's Wells Opera Company (since 1974 English National Opera), Sadler's Wells Theatre, London; The Royal Opera at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London; and numerous other national and international houses.\n Later in his career Kay also became a photographer of subjects with socio-anthropological contents. His photo essay As a Woman, published in 1976, is an extensive portrait of the unique transvestite and transsexual community of Sydney, Australia.\n Kay's artistic contributions to the performing arts are well represented and documented at national museums, state galleries, art libraries, theatre collections and archives globally. Public collections include: the Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre, Melbourne; Victoria & Albert Museum Theatre Collections, London; Royal Opera House Collections, London; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; National Library of Australia, Canberra; State Library of New South Wales, Mitchell Library, Sydney; Lipperheidesche Kost\u00fcmbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin; \u00d6sterreichisches Theatermuseum, Vienna; University of Calgary, Library, Special Collections, Alberta, Canada; MacNay Museum, Tobin Collection of Theatre Arts, San Antonio, Texas.\n In November 2006, the Barry Kay Archive website was archived by the National Library of Australia in its PANDORA web archive.",
