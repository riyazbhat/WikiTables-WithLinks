  "/wiki/TfL_Rail": "TfL Rail is the concession of two separate railway lines in London and its environs whilst the planned link-up between these lines is being constructed. This will form part of the Crossrail service when it opens in mid-2022. At that time, the TfL Rail name will be retired and the services will become operated by Crossrail, with the route named the Elizabeth line. The Elizabeth line was initially due to open in December 2018. TfL Rail was introduced in May 2015 when it took control from Abellio Greater Anglia of the commuter metro service between Liverpool Street in central London and Shenfield in Essex. The branch comprises the first 14 stations on the Great Eastern Main Line, with interchange at Shenfield for medium- and long-distance services beyond to East Anglia. TfL Rail has also taken over operation of some services from Paddington to Heathrow Airport and Reading. Services are operated by MTR Corporation under contract to Transport for London (TfL).",

The Underground has its origins in the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground passenger railway. Opened in January 1863, it is now part of the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines; the first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City & South London Railway in 1890, is now part of the Northern line. The network has expanded to 11 lines, and in 2017/18 carried 1.357 billion passengers, making it the world's 12th busiest metro system. The 11 lines collectively handle up to 5 million passengers a day. The system's first tunnels were built just below the surface, using the cut-and-cover method; later, smaller, roughly circular tunnels\u2014which gave rise to its nickname, the Tube\u2014were dug through at a deeper level. The system has 270 stations and 250 miles (400 km) of track.
