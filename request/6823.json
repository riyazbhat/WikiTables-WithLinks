It typically has a 24 or 44 rhythmic time signature, and two or three parts repeating in patterns such as ABAB or ABCAC. Its lyrics are marked by nostalgia, sadness, and laments for lost love.

After a controversial move made by head coach Greg Ryan to bench Solo in favor of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry for the semifinal, in which the United States was defeated 4\u20130 by Brazil, Solo made headlines with post-game remarks that resulted in many teammates shunning her. She later rebounded to help the United States win gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. During the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, her exceptional skill was highlighted especially during a quarter-final match against Brazil, which the U.S. won on penalty kicks. Although the team lost to Japan in a match that ended in penalties, Solo received the Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper as well as the Bronze Ball award for her overall performance at the tournament.\n Following her performance at the 2011 World Cup, Solo participated in the television show Dancing with the Stars and posed for various magazines, most notably the \"Body Issue\" of ESPN The Magazine.

  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha (sometimes called cha-cha), is a dance of Cuban origin. It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance.\n In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n, danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated. When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound \"cha-cha-cha\". Thus, the new style came to be known as \"cha-cha-ch\u00e1\" and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step.\n The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (one, two, three, cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion. For example, one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern. These Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of Cha Cha and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s, especially those of African origin. Thus, the footwork of the Cha Cha was likely inspired by these Afro-Cuban dances.\n In 1953, Orquesta Am\u00e9rica released two of Jorrin's compositions, \"La Enga\u00f1adora\" and \"Silver Star\", on the Cuban record label Panart. These were the first cha-cha-ch\u00e1 compositions ever recorded. They immediately became hits in Havana, and other Cuban charanga orchestras quickly imitated this new style. Soon, there was a cha-cha-ch\u00e1 craze in Havana's dance halls, popularizing both the music and the associated dance. This craze soon spread to Mexico City, and by 1955 the music and dance of the cha cha cha had become popular in Latin America, the United States, and Western Europe, following in the footsteps of the mambo, which had been a worldwide craze a few years earlier.",

A street dance is a vernacular dance in an urban context.  Vernacular dances are often improvisational and social in nature, encouraging interaction and contact with spectators and other dancers. These dances are a part of the vernacular culture of the geographical area that they come from. Examples of street dance include b-boying (or breakdancing), which originated in New York City.\nClogging is a very early form of street dance, since it evolved in the streets and factories of Northern England in the mid-19th century.\n Various street dances have lent themselves to the style of urban dance, which arose from the collegiate dance scene.

  "/wiki/Viennese_Waltz": "Viennese waltz (German: Wiener Walzer) is a genre of ballroom dance. At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the waltz, including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz.\n What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or \"waltz\" position.  The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar  (the international standard of 30 measures per minute), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words Walzer (German), vals (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and valse (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz.\n The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation.\n As the waltz evolved, some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically \"Viennese waltz\" to distinguish them from the slower waltzes. In the modern ballroom dance, two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized:  International Style and American Style.\n Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance.",
