It must be beautifully done. For like a poem there is not much excuse for it otherwise.\n She originally planned to write a story about a girl who is in love with her piano teacher, but she had what she called a divine spark: Suddenly I said: Frankie is in love with her brother and the bride....

  "/wiki/Irena_Sendler": "Irena Stanis\u0142awa Sendler (n\u00e9e Krzy\u017canowska), also referred to as Irena Sendlerowa in Poland, nom de guerre Jolanta (15 February 1910 \u2013 12 May 2008), was a Polish humanitarian, social worker, and nurse who served in the Polish Underground Resistance during World War II in German-occupied Warsaw. From October 1943 she was head of the children's section of \u017begota, the Polish Council to Aid Jews (Polish: Rada Pomocy \u017bydom). In the 1930s, Sendler conducted her social work as one of the activists connected to the Free Polish University. From 1935 to October 1943, she worked for the Department of Social Welfare and Public Health of the City of Warsaw. She also pursued informally, and during the war, conspiratorial activities such as rescuing Jews, primarily as part of the network of workers and volunteers from that department, mostly women. Sendler participated, with dozens of others, in smuggling Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then providing them with false identity documents and shelter with willing Polish families or in orphanages and other care facilities, including Catholic nun convents, saving those children from the Holocaust. The German occupiers suspected Sendler's involvement in the Polish Underground and in October 1943 she was arrested by the Gestapo, but she managed to hide the list of the names and locations of the rescued Jewish children, preventing this information from falling into the hands of the Gestapo. Withstanding torture and imprisonment, Sendler refused to reveal anything about her work or the location of the saved children.",
  "/wiki/Phineas_and_Ferb": "Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series produced by Disney Television Animation. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007, and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008, on Disney Channel, running until June 12, 2015. The program follows Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project; these are usually unrealistic given the protagonists' ages (and are sometimes downright physically impossible), which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system: running gags occur every episode, and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy (named Agent P) for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness (although he is not especially evil and has a good heart in some situations). The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated. Creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff Swampy Marsh had previously worked together on Fox's The Simpsons and Nickelodeon's Rocko's Modern Life.",
