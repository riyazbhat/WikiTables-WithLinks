Situated at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta River, it protected medieval Sweden's only access to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, along with the nearby settlement known today as Gothenburg  (formerly named L\u00f6d\u00f6se, Nya L\u00f6d\u00f6se, \u00c4lvsborg and Charles IX's Gothenburg). The original Old \u00c4lvsborg Fortress (Swedish: \u00c4lvsborgs f\u00e4stning or \u00c4lvsborgs slott) was located on the mainland, on the southern shore of the estuary, above modern Klippan. Only few ruins are visible today in the vicinity of the Carnegie-pier. The old fortress was dismantled and relocated to one of the islands in the estuary, in the 17th century. This New \u00c4lvsborg Fortress (Swedish: Nya Elfsborg) is still maintained. In 1643, a settlement in New Sweden, North America, was named Fort Nya Elfsborg (\"Fort New \u00c4lvsborg\"), after the Swedish fortress. This settlement was abandoned in 1655.",

Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus. In addition to the generous privileges (e.g. tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. At a key strategic location at the mouth of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv, where Scandinavia's largest drainage basin enters the sea, the Port of Gothenburg is now the largest port in the Nordic countries. Gothenburg is home to many students, as the city includes the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. Volvo was founded in Gothenburg in 1927.",
