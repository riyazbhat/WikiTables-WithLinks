  "/wiki/Noh": "Noh (\u80fd, N\u014d, derived from the Sino-Japanese word for \"skill\" or \"talent\"), is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami, it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today. Although the terms Noh and n\u014dgaku are sometimes used interchangeably, n\u014dgaku encompasses both Noh and ky\u014dgen. Traditionally, a full n\u014dgaku program includes five Noh plays with comedic ky\u014dgen plays in between; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one ky\u014dgen piece has become common today. Optionally, an okina play may be presented in the very beginning of n\u014dgaku presentation.\n Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story. Noh integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts, women, children, and the elderly. Written in late middle Japanese, the text \"vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries\".[attribution needed] Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, Noh is extremely codified and regulated by the iemoto system.",
  "/wiki/\u014ctsuzumi": "The \u014ctsuzumi (\u5927\u9f13), also known as the \u014ckawa (\u5927\u76ae), is an hourglass-shaped Japanese drum.  It is a larger version of the tsuzumi, or kotsuzumi and is used in traditional Japanese theater and folk music. Its appearance is slightly different from that of the tsuzumi, and the sound produced is vastly different from any of the four sounds the kotsuzumi produces. Whereas the kotsuzumi is smaller and has a more ornate drum head, the \u014dkawa is larger, and its head takes on a more plain, leathery appearance. The sound is also higher and sharper in pitch, resembling more of a dry, almost metallic \"crack\" than the tsuzumi's softer \"pon\" sound. The hourglass structure is slightly bigger, and has a prominent protruding \"knob\" at the middle, unlike that of the kotsuzumi, which has a smoothened-out middle section. The heads of the drum are taut very tightly, leaving no room for further tension, and acoustic, adjustments. The \u014dkawa is played on the left thigh of the player, possibly due to its larger, heavy size, whereas the tsuzumi is played upon the right shoulder.\n The drum heads are made of thick, stiff horsehide taken from grown horses, and care for the drum heads of the \u014dkawa is peculiar in that they must be kept dry at all times. In contrast, the heads of the smaller kotsuzumi must always be moist. Since the sound of the \u014dkawa is supposed to be higher in pitch, the player must ensure that the skin of the drum-heads remains as constricted as possible, and this is best realized when the drum heads are kept dry. To keep the drum heads dry, they are often heated near a kind of old style of Japanese furnace called a hibachi no less than an hour before the performance. When ready to perform, the player takes the drumheads and binds them to the body of the \u014dkawa as tightly as possible using a thick, heavy duty hemp rope, and uses a type of thinner silk rope to further constrict the rope binding the drumheads and to provide grip for the player, before finishing the preparation by draping an ornamental hemp rope with long tassels onto the drum. Given the nature of the heads of the \u014dkawa, they wear after a specific number of times. Since they are very expensive, at least a thousand US dollars a pair, the \u014dkawa player must measure how many times, and how long, the instrument is played. If the heads are taken good care of, they can be used for as much as ten performances, after which the heads show signs of wear, lose their desired sound quality, and must be discarded.\n Like the tsuzumi, the \u014dkawa is also struck with a player's bare hands. As the drum heads are taut very tightly, it often hurts to play the drum, and calluses must be developed on the player's fingers to play comfortably. The calluses must be taken care of, being shaved with a knife from time to time before they get too big. Most players use deerhide padding on the palm of their hand, to protect their palm and enhance the sound. They also wear fingerstalls made of multiple layers of Japanese washi paper, hardened with starch, on their fingers.",
  "/wiki/Taiko": "The origin of the instruments is unclear, though there have been many suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588 CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko, a drum that originated in South China. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko. Certain court music styles, especially gigaku and gagaku, arrived in Japan through both Korea and China. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.\n Archaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE, during the latter part of the Kofun period, and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals. This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture. Two of these figures are depicted playing drums; one of them, wearing skins, is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height. This statue is titled \"Man Beating the Taiko\" and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan. Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions.\n The Nihon Shoki, the second oldest book of Japanese classical history, contains a mythological story describing the origin of taiko.  The myth tells how Amaterasu, who had sealed herself inside a cave in anger, was beckoned out by an elder goddess Ame-no-Uzume when others had failed.  Ame-no-Uzume accomplished this by emptying out a barrel of sake and dancing furiously on top of it.  Historians regard her performance as the mythological creation of taiko music.",
  "/wiki/Ky\u014dgen": "Ky\u014dgen (\u72c2\u8a00, \"mad words\" or \"wild speech\") is a form of traditional Japanese comic theater. It developed alongside Noh, was performed along with Noh as an intermission of sorts between Noh acts on the same stage, and retains close links to Noh in the modern day; therefore, it is sometimes designated Noh-ky\u014dgen.  Its contents are nevertheless not at all similar to the formal, symbolic, and solemn Noh theater; ky\u014dgen is a comic form, and its primary goal is to make its audience laugh. \n Ky\u014dgen together with Noh is part of N\u014dgaku theatre.\nKy\u014dgen is sometimes compared to the Italian comic form of commedia dell'arte, which developed around the same period (14th century) and likewise features stock characters. It also has parallels with the Greek satyr play, a short, comical play performed between tragedies.",
  "/wiki/Hayashi_(music)": "A hayashi (\u56c3\u5b50) is a group of performers who provide musical accompaniment for Japanese Noh or kabuki theatre, yose (\u5bc4\u5e2d) performances of rakugo, or a festival.\n In Noh, the hayashi sit along the rear of the stage, facing the audience and fully visible. A distinct and separate group of performers from the chorus, they are purely instrumentalists; the type of instruments featured and the order in which they sit on stage follow established practices. The leftmost performer plays a small taiko, set on a stand before him, with two drumsticks. To his right is the \u014dtsuzumi hip drum, followed by the kotsuzumi shoulder drum, and the Noh flute (n\u014dkan or simply fue).\n In kabuki, a number of shamisen players are added, along with, depending on the play, taiko drums of various sizes, various types of flutes, and other instruments, including a myriad of devices for sound effects. The kabuki hayashi is generally located in a small room just off-stage, and is not visible to the audience, though a barred window in the walls of the stage set indicates its location. For matsubame plays and dances, those based on works from Noh and ky\u014dgen, the hayashi will often be located along the rear of the stage, fully visible in imitation of Noh and ky\u014dgen modes.\n As with kabuki actors, and other performers in traditional arts, instrumentalists in the traditions of Noh hayashi, kabuki hayashi, and nagauta shamisen (the shamisen style used in kabuki and bunraku), are members of a number of traditional lineages, following the iemoto system. Performers traditionally take on the name of their school as an art-name (i.e. stage name). Notable hayashi lineages include the T\u014dsha school, Mochizuki school, and Tanaka school. Nagauta shamisen schools include the Kineya school and Imafuji school, among others.\n In a rakugo yose, the music includes shamisen and percussion parts. At festivals, the performers play flutes and percussion instruments.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Living_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(performing_arts)": "The List of Living National Treasures of Japan (performing arts) contains all the individuals and groups certified as Living National Treasures by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of the government of Japan in the category of the performing arts (\u82b8\u80fd, gein\u014d).\n The performing arts are divided into eight categories: Gagaku, Noh, Bunraku, Kabuki, Kumi Odori, Music, Dance, and Drama. The categories are subdivided into a number of subcategories, usually by role or instrument.\n Those working in the performing arts are eligible for recognition either individually (Individual Certification) or as part of a group (General Certification)."
