  "/wiki/Muscogee_(Creek)_Nation": "The Muscogee (Creek) Nation is a federally recognized Native American tribe based in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The nation descends from the historic Creek Confederacy, a large group of indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands. Official languages include Muscogee, Yuchi, Natchez, Alabama, and Koasati, with Muscogee retaining the largest number of speakers. They commonly refer to themselves as Este Mvskokvlke (pronounced\u00a0[isti m\u0259sk\u00f3g\u0259lgi]). Historically, they were often referred to by European Americans as one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast.\n The Muscogee (Creek) Nation is the largest of the federally recognized Muscogee tribes. The Muskogean-speaking Alabama, Koasati, Hitchiti, and Natchez people is also enrolled in this nation. Algonquian-speaking Shawnee and Yuchi (language isolate) are also enrolled in the Muscogee Creek Nation, although historically, the latter two groups were from different language families and cultures than the Muscogee. \n Other federally recognized Muscogee groups include the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Kialegee Tribal Town, and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town of Oklahoma; the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, and the Poarch Band of Creeks in Alabama.",
  "/wiki/Indian_Territory": "As general terms, Indian Territory or the Indian Territories  describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land. In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in 1803. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the US federal government's 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), the policy of the US government was one of assimilation.\n The term Indian Reserve describes lands the British government set aside for Indigenous tribes between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River in the time before the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783).\n Indian Territory later came to refer to an unorganized territory whose general borders were initially set by the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834, and was the successor to the remainder of the Missouri Territory after Missouri received statehood.  The borders of Indian Territory were reduced in size as various Organic Acts were passed by Congress to create incorporated territories of the United States.  The 1907 Oklahoma Enabling Act created the single state of Oklahoma by combining Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory, ending the existence of an Indian Territory.\n Indian reservations remain within the boundaries of US states, but largely exempt from state jurisdiction. The term Indian country is used to lands under the control of Native nations, including Indian reservations, trust lands on tribal jurisdictional areas, or, more casually, to describe anywhere large numbers of Native Americans live.",
  "/wiki/Treaty_with_Choctaws_and_Chickasaws": "The Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws was a treaty signed on July 12, 1861 between the Choctaw and Chickasaw (American Indian) and the Confederate States of America. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with Cherokee chief John Ross, which was concluded in 1861. The treaty was ratified and was proclaimed on December 20, 1861 by the Confederacy. The Choctaw and Chickasaw also duly ratified the treaty.\n Some Choctaws identified with the Southern cause and a few owned slaves. In addition, they well remembered and resented the Indian removals from thirty years earlier and poor service they received from the federal government.  The main reason the Choctaw Nation agreed to sign the treaty, however, was for protection from regional tribes.",
  "/wiki/Choctaw": "The Choctaw (Choctaw: Chahta)[note 1] are a Native American people originally occupying what is now the Southeastern United States (modern-day Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana). Their Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group.\n They are believed to be descended from the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures, who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound in what is present-day central Mississippi. It is still considered sacred by the Choctaw, who regained control of the site in 2008. The anthropologist John Reed Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader. Henry Halbert, a historian, suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase Hacha hatak (river people).\n The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century in the Southeast encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The Choctaw coalesced as a people in the 17th century, and developed three distinct political and geographical divisions: eastern, western and southern. These groups sometimes formed distinct, independent alliances with European powers, including the French, based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana Territory; the English of the Southeast; and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the American Revolution, most Choctaw supported the Thirteen Colonies' bid for independence from the British Empire. They never went to war against the United States, but were forcibly relocated in 1831\u201333 as part of Indian Removal, in order for the US to take over their land in the Southeast for development by European Americans.\n In the 19th century, prior to removal, European Americans classified the Choctaw as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" because they adopted numerous practices of their United States neighbors. The Choctaw and the US agreed to nine treaties. By the last three, the US gained vast land cessions; they removed most Choctaw west of the Mississippi to Indian Territory, sending them on a forced migration far from their homelands. The Choctaw were the first Native American tribe to relocate under the Indian Removal Act. Some US leaders believed that by reducing conflict between the peoples, they were saving the Choctaw from extinction. The Choctaw negotiated the largest area and most desirable lands in Indian Territory. Their early government had three districts, each with its own chief, who together with the town chiefs sat on their National Council. They appointed a Choctaw Delegate to represent them to the US government in Washington, DC.\n By the 1831 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, those Choctaw who chose to stay in the newly formed state of Mississippi were to be considered state and U.S. citizens. They were one of the first major non-European ethnic groups to be eligible for U.S. citizenship. Article 14 in the 1830 treaty with the Choctaw stated Choctaws may wish to become citizens of the United States under the 14th Article of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek on all of the combined lands that were consolidated under Article I from all previous treaties between the United States and the Choctaw.\n During the American Civil War, the Choctaw in Oklahoma and Mississippi mostly sided with the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy had suggested to its leaders that it would support a state under Indian control if it won the war.\n After the Civil War, the Choctaw remaining in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana fell into obscurity for some time. The Choctaw in Oklahoma no longer considered the Choctaw in the Southeast part of the Choctaw Nation. But at the turn of the 20th century, Jack Amos legally challenged the position of the Choctaw Nation, appealing to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The issue was later litigated in court.\n In 1978, the United States Supreme Court held that all remnants of the Choctaw Nation are entitled to all rights of the federally recognized Nation. On May 19, 1977, the federal government formally recognized the existence of the Choctaw communities of Mobile and Washington counties, along the Tombigbee and Mobile rivers.\n The Choctaw in Oklahoma struggled to build a nation. They relocated the Choctaw Academy there and opened an academy for girls in the 1840s. In the aftermath of the Dawes Act in the late 19th century, the US dissolved tribal governments in order to extinguish Indian land claims in the territory. This was believed integral to assimilating the people, as well as preparing the Indian and Oklahoma territories for statehood in 1907. From that period, the US appointed chiefs of the Choctaw and other tribes in the former Indian Territory.\n During World War I, Choctaw soldiers served in the U.S. military as the first Native American codetalkers, using the Choctaw language. After the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Choctaw reconstituted their government. The Choctaw Nation kept their culture alive despite years of pressure to assimilate.\n The Choctaw are the third-largest federally recognized tribe. Since the mid-20th century, they have created new institutions, such as a tribal college, housing authority, and justice system. Today the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians are the federally recognized Choctaw tribes. Mississippi also recognizes another band, and smaller Choctaw groups are in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas.\n The Alabama Choctaw are federally recognized under 24 C.F.R 1000 and 25 U.S.C. 4101, called the Native American Housing Self-Determination Act of 1986 (formerly the \"Indian\" Housing Act of 1937). The US government holds the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation in trust as a reservation for the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians.\n The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians in Alabama and the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council, composed solely of non-federally recognized tribes under Chief Framon Weaver, obtained a US Supreme Court ruling that sovereign immunity not only applies to entities such as the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council as an arm of the tribe, but is inherent to and possessed by Indians because they are Indians. This decision of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 2002.",

The Chickasaw Nation originated in its homeland of the American Southeast, with territory in what are defined as modern-day Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky.\n In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European Americans knew the Chickasaw as one of the historic Five Civilized Tribes, all of whom were based in what became the Southeastern United States.",
  "/wiki/Seminole": "The Seminole are a Native American people originally from Florida. Today, they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups. The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century, most significantly northern Muscogee (Creeks) from what is now Georgia and Alabama. The word \"Seminole\" is derived from the Muscogee word siman\u00f3-li, which may itself be derived from the Spanish word cimarr\u00f3n, meaning \"runaway\" or \"wild one\".\n Seminole culture is largely derived from that of the Creek; the most important ceremony is the Green Corn Dance; other notable traditions include use of the black drink and ritual tobacco. As the Seminole adapted to Florida environs, they developed local traditions, such as the construction of open-air, thatched-roof houses known as chickees. Historically the Seminole spoke Mikasuki and Creek, both Muskogean languages.\n The Seminole became increasingly independent of other Creek groups and established their own identity. They developed a thriving trade network during the British and second Spanish periods (roughly 1767\u20131821). The tribe expanded considerably during this time, and was further supplemented from the late 18th century by free blacks and escaped slaves who settled near and paid tribute to Seminole towns. The latter became known as Black Seminoles, although they kept their own Gullah culture. After the United States achieved independence, its settlers increased pressure on Seminole lands, leading to the Seminole Wars (1818\u20131858). The Seminole were first confined to a large inland reservation by the Treaty of Moultrie Creek (1823) and then forcibly evicted from Florida by the Treaty of Payne's Landing (1832). By 1842, most Seminoles and Black Seminoles had been removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. During the American Civil War, most Oklahoma Seminole allied with the Confederacy, after which they had to sign a new treaty with the U.S., including freedom and tribal membership for the Black Seminole. Today residents of the reservation are enrolled in the federally recognized Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, while others belong to unorganized groups.\n Perhaps fewer than 200 Seminoles remained in Florida after the Third Seminole War (1855\u20131858), but they fostered a resurgence in traditional customs and a culture of staunch independence. In the late 19th century, the Florida Seminole re-established limited relations with the U.S. government and in 1930 received 5,000 acres (20\u00a0km2) of reservation lands. Few Seminole moved to reservations until the 1940s; they reorganized their government and received federal recognition in 1957 as the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The more traditional people near the Tamiami Trail received federal recognition as the Miccosukee Tribe in 1962.\n Seminole groups in Oklahoma and Florida had little contact with each other until well into the 20th century, but each developed along similar lines as the groups strived to maintain their culture while they struggled economically. Old crafts and traditions were revived in the mid-20th century as Seminoles began seeking tourism dollars when Americans began to travel more on the country's growing highway system. In the 1970s, Seminole tribes began to run small bingo games on their reservations to raise revenue, winning court challenges to initiate Indian gaming, which many U.S. tribes have adopted to generate revenues for welfare, education, and development. The Seminole Tribe of Florida has been particularly successful with gambling establishments, and in 2007, it purchased the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and has rebranded or opened several large gaming resorts under that name.",

Within the United States, the government  federally recognizes the Comanche people as the Comanche Nation, headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma.\n The Comanche became the dominant  tribe on the southern Great Plains in the 18th and 19th centuries.  They are often characterized[by whom?] as \"Lords of the Plains\" and, reflecting their erstwhile prominence, they presided over a large area called Comancheria, which came to include large portions of present-day Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.\n Comanche power depended on bison, horses, trading, and raiding. The Comanche hunted the bison of the Great Plains for food and skins; their adoption of the horse from Spanish colonists in New Mexico made them more mobile; they traded with the  Spanish,  French, Americans and neighboring Native-American peoples; and (most famously) they waged war on and raided European settlements as well as other Native Americans.  They took captives from weaker tribes during warfare, using them as  slaves or selling them to the Spanish and (later)  Mexican settlers. They also took thousands of captives from the Spanish, Mexican, and American settlers and incorporated them into Comanche society.\n Decimated by European diseases, warfare, and encroachment by Americans on Comancheria, most Comanches were forced into life on the  reservation; a few however sought refuge with the  Mescalero Apaches in New Mexico, or with the  Kickapoos in Mexico. A number of them returned in the 1890s and early 1900s. In the 21st century, the Comanche Nation has 17,000 members, around 7,000 of whom reside in tribal jurisdictional areas around Lawton, Fort Sill, and the surrounding areas of southwestern Oklahoma. The Comanche Homecoming Annual Dance takes place annually in Walters, Oklahoma, in mid-July.\n The Comanche language is a Numic language of the  Uto-Aztecan family, sometimes classified as a Shoshoni dialect. Only about 1% of Comanches speak this language today.\n The name \"Comanche\" comes from the Ute name for the people: k\u0268mantsi (enemy),. The name Padouca, which before about 1740 was applied[by whom?] to Plains Apaches, was sometimes applied to the Comanche by French writers from the east.",

Their dire situation was exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. The divisions and troubles of the American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them farther west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in Oklahoma, with some communities living also in Wisconsin and Ontario.",

The tribe developed in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys around 700 BC along with other groups of its language family. They migrated west of the Mississippi after the 17th century due to wars with Iroquois invading the Ohio Valley from New York and Pennsylvania in a search for new hunting grounds. The nations separated at that time, and the Osage settled near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.\n The term \"Osage\" is a French version of the tribe's name, which can be roughly translated as \"warlike\". The Osage people refer to themselves in their indigenous Dhegihan Siouan language as \ud801\udccf\ud801\udcd8\ud801\udcfb\ud801\udcd8\ud801\udcfb\ud801\udcdf (Wazhazhe), or \"Mid-waters\".\n At the height of their power in the early 19th century, the Osage had become the dominant power in the region, feared by neighboring tribes. The tribe controlled the area between the Missouri and Red rivers, the Ozarks to the east and the foothills of the Wichita Mountains to the south. They depended on nomadic buffalo hunting and agriculture.\n The 19th-century painter George Catlin described the Osage as \"the tallest race of men in North America, either red or white skins; there being ... many of them six and a half, and others seven feet.\"\n The missionary Isaac McCoy described the Osage as an \"uncommonly fierce, courageous, warlike nation\" and said they were the \"finest looking Indians I have ever seen in the West\".\n In the Ohio Valley, the Osage originally lived among speakers of the same Dhegihan language stock, such as the Kansa, Ponca, Omaha, and Quapaw.  Researchers believe that the tribes likely became differentiated in languages and cultures after leaving the lower Ohio country. The Omaha and Ponca settled in what is now Nebraska, the Kansa in Kansas, and the Quapaw in Arkansas.\n In the 19th century, the Osage were forced to remove from Kansas to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), and the majority of their descendants live in Oklahoma. In the early 20th century, oil was discovered on their land. Many Osage became wealthy through leasing fees generated by their headrights. However, during the 1920s, they suffered manipulation and numerous murders by whites eager to take over their wealth. In the 21st century, the federally recognized Osage Nation has ~20,000 enrolled members, 6,780 of whom reside in the tribe's jurisdictional area.

Prior to the 18th century, they were concentrated in what is now southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, edges of western South Carolina, northeastern Georgia and northeastern Alabama.\n The Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group. In the 19th century, James Mooney, an American ethnographer, recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, where other Iroquoian-speaking peoples lived; however, anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte writes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago.\n By the 19th century, European settlers in the United States classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers.\n Today there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribes: the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) in Oklahoma, and the Cherokee Nation (CN) in Oklahoma.\n The Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal members, making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States.

The UKB are mostly descendants of \"Old Settlers\", Cherokee who migrated to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817 prior to Indian Removal. They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act.

  "/wiki/John_Ross_(Cherokee_chief)": "John Ross (Cherokee: \u13ab\u13eb\u13cd\u13ab\u13eb, romanized:\u00a0guwisguwi) (October 3, 1790 \u2013 August 1, 1866), (meaning in Cherokee: \"Mysterious Little White Bird\"), was the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation from 1828\u20131866, serving longer in this position than any other person. Described as the Moses of his people, Ross influenced the Indian nation through such tumultuous events as the relocation to Indian Territory and the American Civil War.\n John Ross was the son of a Cherokee mother and a Scottish father. His mother and maternal grandmother were of mixed Scots-Cherokee ancestry, since his maternal grandfather was another Scottish immigrant. As a result, young John (one-eighth Cherokee by blood quantum) grew up bilingual and bicultural, an experience that served him well when his parents decided to send him to schools that served other mixed-race Cherokee. After graduation, he was appointed an Indian agent in 1811. During the War  of 1812, he served as adjutant of a Cherokee regiment under the command of Andrew Jackson. After the Red Stick War ended, Ross demonstrated his business acumen by starting a tobacco plantation in Tennessee. In 1816, he built a warehouse and trading post on the Tennessee River north of the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, and started a ferry service that carried passengers from the south side of the river (Cherokee Nation) to the north side (USA). His businesses served as the start of a community known as Ross's Landing on the Tennessee River (now modern-day Chattanooga, Tennessee). Concurrently, John Ross developed a keen interest in Cherokee politics, attracting the attention of the Cherokee elders, especially Principal Chiefs Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks, who, along with Major Ridge, became his political mentors.\n Ross first went to Washington, D.C. in 1816 as part of a Cherokee delegation to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, he was elected to the National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of mixed blood. Even the traditionalist full-blood Cherokee perceived that he had the skills necessary to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, making the Cherokee the first tribe to ever do so. Along the way, Ross built political support in the capital for the Cherokee cause.\n Both Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks died in January 1827. Hicks's brother, William, was appointed interim chief. Ross and Major Ridge shared responsibilities for the affairs of the tribe. William Hicks did not impress the Cherokee as a leader. They elected Ross as permanent principal chief in October 1828, a position he held until his death.\n The problem of removal split the Cherokee Nation politically. Ross, backed by the majority, tried repeatedly to stop white political powers from forcing the tribe to move. They became known as the National Party. Others, who came to believe that further resistance would be futile, wanted to seek the best settlement they could get. They formed the \"Treaty Party\" or \"Ridge Party,\" led by Major Ridge. The Treaty Party was convinced to sign the Treaty of New Echota on December 29, 1835, requiring the Cherokee to leave by 1838. Neither Ross nor the council approved it, but the Federal government regarded the treaty as valid. To enforce the treaty, the Federal government ordered the Army to move those who did not depart by 1838 in an action known ever after as the \"Trail of Tears.\" About one-fourth of the Cherokee forced to move died along the trail. The dead included Ross's wife, Quatie.\n Ross tried unsuccessfully to restore political unity after the arrival in Indian Territory. Unknown people assassinated the leaders of the Treaty Party, except for Stand Watie, who escaped and became Ross's most implacable foe. Soon, the issue of slavery refueled the old division. The Treaty Party morphed into the \"Southern Party,\" while the National Party largely became the \"Union Party.\" Ross initially counseled neutrality, believing that joining in the \"white man's war\" would be disastrous for the tribe. After Union Forces abandoned their forts in Indian Territory, Ross reversed himself and signed a treaty with the Confederacy. He later fled to Union-held Kansas and Stand Watie became the de facto chief. The Confederates lost the war, Watie became the last Confederate general to surrender, and Ross returned to his post as principal chief. Confronted with negotiating the Reconstruction Treaty with the United States, he made yet another trip to Washington, where he died on August 1, 1866.",
  "/wiki/List_of_treaties_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America": "This is a list of treaties of the Confederate States of America.\n The Confederate States of America (CSA) was not officially recognized as a sovereign state by any foreign nation. Thus, the CSA did not enter into any bilateral or multilateral treaties with other states.\n However, in 1861, the CSA authorized Albert Pike\u2014the CSA \"Commissioner to all the Indian Tribes West of Arkansas and South of Kansas\"\u2014to negotiate and conclude treaties with native Indian tribes resident in Indian Territory. Pike concluded nine treaties with Indian tribes between July and October 1861. Each of the nine treaties were ratified by the CSA Congress prior to the end of the year."
