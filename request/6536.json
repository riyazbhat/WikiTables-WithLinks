  "/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings": "This list of tallest buildings includes skyscrapers with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least 350 m. Non-building structures, such as towers, are not included in this list (see list of tallest buildings and structures). \n Historically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in England in 1311. Until the completion of the Washington Monument in 1884 the world's tallest buildings were churches and cathedrals, Christian places of worship, in Europe. The early skyscraper was pioneered in Chicago, forming the basis for which the United States would hold the position of the world's tallest building for much of the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then only two more buildings have held the title: Taipei 101 and Burj Khalifa. \n Since the beginning of the 21st century, Western Asia, China, as well as Southeast Asia have seen a boom in skyscraper construction."
