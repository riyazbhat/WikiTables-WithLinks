  "/wiki/Dystopia": "A dystopia (from Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3- \"bad\" and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"place\"; alternatively, cacotopia, kakotopia, or simply anti-utopia) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening. It is translated as \"bad place\" and is an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work, published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.\n Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization, tyrannical governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations particularly in stories set in the future. Some of the most famous examples are George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are or have been totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse.\n Some scholars, such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent, make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes, whereas anti-utopias function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.\nIn his Dystopia: A Natural History (Oxford University Press, 2017) Claeys offers a more nuanced and historical approach to these definitions. Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution. Its commonly anti-collectivist character is stressed, and the addition of other themes (the dangers of science and technology, of social inequality, of corporate dictatorship, of nuclear war) are also traced.",

The phrase \"nonagon infinity\" is also referenced in the lyrics of \"The Lord of Lightning\" off 2017's Murder of the Universe.",
  "/wiki/Nick_Cave_&_the_Bad_Seeds": "Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are an Australian rock band formed in Melbourne in 1983 by vocalist Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and guitarist-vocalist Blixa Bargeld. The band has featured international personnel throughout its career and presently consists of Cave, violinist and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey (all from Australia), guitarist George Vjestica (United Kingdom), keyboardist/percussionist Toby Dammit (United States) and drummers Thomas Wydler (Switzerland) and Jim Sclavunos (United States). With their \"brutal blues and gothic nightmares\" songs, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have been considered \"one of the most original and celebrated bands of the post-punk and alternative rock eras in the '80s and onward\". They have released seventeen studio albums and completed numerous international tours.\n The band was founded in 1983 following the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group the Birthday Party, the members of which met at a boarding school in Victoria. By the release of their fifth studio album Tender Prey in 1988, they shifted from post-punk towards an experimental alternative rock sound,[citation needed] later incorporating various influences throughout their career. 2008's Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! and the side-project Grinderman were influenced by garage rock. Synthesizers and minimal guitar work feature prominently on Push the Sky Away (2013), recorded after Harvey's departure from the band in 2009.",
  "/wiki/Skeleton_Tree": "Skeleton Tree is the sixteenth studio album by Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. It was released on 9 September 2016 on Bad Seed Ltd. A follow-up to the band's critically acclaimed album Push the Sky Away (2013), Skeleton Tree was recorded over 18 months at Retreat Recording Studios in Brighton, La Frette Studios in La Frette-sur-Seine and Air Studios in London. It was produced by Nick Cave, Warren Ellis and Nick Launay. During the sessions Cave's 15-year-old son Arthur died from an accidental cliff fall. Most of the album had been written at the time of Cave's son's death, but several lyrics were amended by Cave during subsequent recording sessions and feature themes of death, loss and personal grief.\n Skeleton Tree's minimal production and \"less polished\" sound incorporates elements of electronica and ambient music and, like Push the Sky Away, features extensive use of synthesizers, drum machines and loops. Several songs on the album utilise avant-garde techniques, including the use of dissonant musical elements and non-standard song structures. Cave's allegorical and often-improvised lyrics have also been noted to be less narrative and character-based than on previous Bad Seeds albums.\n One More Time with Feeling, a documentary film about the aftermath of Cave's son's death and the recording process of Skeleton Tree, accompanied the album's release. Directed by Andrew Dominik, the film received a limited release and was conceived by Cave to explain the context and themes of Skeleton Tree without conducting interviews with the media. Both the film and the album received widespread critical acclaim.",

Angus Andrew is the only original member of Liars to feature on the album, following the departures of Julian Gross and Aaron Hemphill in 2014 and 2017 respectively.\n Speaking of the process of recording the album, Angus said: \"A lot of the sounds I was working on were samples, they lived inside my computer, but I still wanted to have a connection with everything around me. So everything I was recording was in context of the world outside the studio... Sometimes I\u2019d have my headphones on, just listening to the bush, and a bird would fly up and scream into the microphone. The truth is, even in New York or LA, I was still pretty isolated. Here, there are no other people around, but I feel much more connected to the environment around me than in a big city.\"\n On the subject of the cover art, Angus states:\n \"I\u2019ve always felt like I was married to my band mates you know? It\u2019s probably a common sentiment. In a band, you enter this nuptial and it\u2019s great. You live, breathe, and eat together but now I\u2019m alone without my grooms. That\u2019s where I got the idea to be this bride character on my own. That sort of snowballs. I felt like I could\u2019ve easily made an album cover with the landscape where I recorded it or a crying fountain. That would\u2019ve been too obvious. This is the kind of creative decision which is scary. Scary creative decisions are the ones that are good!\n \nI was up all sorts of nights thinking to myself \u201cAm I really gonna do this? Oh my God, I\u2019m really gonna do this! Okay, I\u2019m gonna put myself on the cover in a wedding dress!\u201d and you really can't stop it from there. It just takes on its own life.\"",

He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He has worked with other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture the vastness of the culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly \"one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise.\" Kelly has said, \"Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet\".\n After growing up in Adelaide, Kelly travelled around Australia before settling in Melbourne in 1976. He became involved in the pub rock scene and drug culture, and recorded two albums with Paul Kelly and the Dots. Kelly moved to Sydney by 1985, where he formed Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. The band was renamed Paul Kelly and the Messengers, initially only for international releases, to avoid possible racist interpretations. At the end of the 1980s, Kelly returned to Melbourne, and in 1991 he disbanded the Messengers. Kelly was married and divorced twice; he has three children and resides in St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne. Dan Kelly, his nephew, is a singer and guitarist in his own right. Dan performed with Kelly on Ways and Means and Stolen Apples. Both were members of Stardust Five, which released a self-titled album in 2006. On 22 September 2010 Kelly released his memoir, How to Make Gravy, which he described as \"it's not traditional; it's writing around the A\u2013Z theme \u2013 I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order\". His biographical film, Paul Kelly: Stories of Me, directed by Ian Darling, was released to cinemas in October 2012.\n Kelly's Top 40 singles include \"Billy Baxter\", \"Before Too Long\", \"Darling It Hurts\", \"To Her Door\" (his highest-charting local hit in 1987), \"Dumb Things\" (appeared on United States charts in 1988), and \"Roll on Summer\".

Aside from \"Treaty\", Kelly wrote or co-wrote several songs on Indigenous Australian social issues and historical events. He provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. The album Women at the Well from 2002 had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute.
