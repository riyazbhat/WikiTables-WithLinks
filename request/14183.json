His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook. Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, Marie from Sunny Italy, in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international hit, Alexander's Ragtime Band in 1911. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever. Alexander's Ragtime Band sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania. Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to reach the heart of the average American, whom he saw as the real soul of the country. In doing so, said Walter Cronkite, at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives. He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards.
