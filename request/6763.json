The competition consisted of men's and women's team events, and what had been billed as one of the most open tournaments certainly lived up to expectations.\n In the women's gold medal game, the lead changed hands five times, with the USA outlasting China by a score of 6\u20135, with never more than one goal in it. The winning goal came from Asya Miller with less than a minute to go.\n The gold medal in the men's game was even more dramatic. Lithuania, the current world champions, took advantage of a clutch of penalties in the first half to jump ahead of China by 6 goals to 2 at the half, and looked to be holding on despite a steady comeback. With only 50 seconds on the clock, the Chinese were two goals behind (6\u20138) but managed to overturn the deficit with three goals in 30 seconds to take the gold 9\u20138, sending the packed BIT Gymnasium into rapture.",
