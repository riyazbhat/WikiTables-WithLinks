Among Amtrak stations in Iowa, Osceola is closest to Des Moines, Iowa's capital and most populous city; however, the station is still almost 50 miles (80 km) from the center of Des Moines. The Osceola Depot was built in 1907 by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q), one of the major networks operating in the upper Midwest and West during much of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Designed in the Prairie Style, the reddish-brown brick depot has a low slung, horizontal profile reinforced by the limestone water table and belt courses that wrap around the building. Originally a combination depot, the building contained freight and passenger areas under one roof. The ticket office retains many original features, such as ticket windows, wood benches and light fixtures. It passed to Burlington Northern in 1970 upon the Q's merger with Great Northern and Northern Pacific, and became part of the BNSF Railway in 1995. In 2007, following a decade of talks with BNSF, the city of Osceola gained ownership of the historic building.",
