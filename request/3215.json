  "/wiki/Petrochemicals": "Petrochemicals (also known as petroleum distillates) are the chemical products obtained from petroleum by refining. Some chemical compounds made from petroleum are also obtained from other fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas, or renewable sources such as maize, palm fruit or sugar cane. The two most common petrochemical classes are olefins (including ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (including benzene, toluene and xylene isomers). Oil refineries produce olefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions. Chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane. Aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha. Olefins and aromatics are the building-blocks for a wide range of materials such as solvents, detergents, and adhesives. Olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers, lubricants, and gels. Global ethylene and propylene production are about 115 million tonnes and 70 million tonnes per annum, respectively. Aromatics production is approximately 70 million tonnes. The largest petrochemical industries are located in the USA and Western Europe; however, major growth in new production capacity is in the Middle East and Asia.

Wolves was one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888. The club in 2019-20 is enjoying its 65th season of top flight football; Wolves's longest continuous period in the top tier was 26 consecutive seasons in the 33 years between 1932 and 1965 (n.b. there was no league football between 1939 and 1946 due to World War II). In the 1950s, Wolves were English League champions three times (1953-54, 1957-58 and 1958-59), under the management of Stan Cullis. Wolves have also finished League runners-up on five occasions, most recently in 1959-60. Wolves have won the FA Cup four times, most recently in 1960, and finished runners-up on a further four occasions. The club has also won the Football League Cup twice, in 1974 and 1980. In 1953, Wolves was one of the first British clubs to install floodlights, taking part in televised floodlit friendlies against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956 in the run-up to the creation of the European Cup in 1955 and the first participation of an English club side in that competition in 1956. Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the 1959-60 European Cup and the semi-finals of the 1960-61 European Cup Winners' Cup, and were runners-up to Tottenham Hotspur in the inaugural UEFA Cup Final in 1972.",
