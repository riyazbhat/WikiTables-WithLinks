  "/wiki/Silverthrone_Caldera": "The Silverthrone Caldera is a potentially active caldera complex in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, located over 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) northwest of the city of Vancouver and about 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi) west of Mount Waddington in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains. The caldera is one of the  largest of the few calderas in western Canada, measuring about 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) long (north-south) and 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) wide (east-west). Mount Silverthrone, an eroded lava dome on the caldera's northern flank that is 2,864 metres (9,396\u00a0ft) high, may be the highest volcano in Canada.",
  "/wiki/Caldera": "A caldera is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber/reservoir in a volcanic eruption. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time, structural support for the rock above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the emptied or partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven caldera-forming collapses are known to have occurred since 1900, most recently at B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga volcano, Iceland in 2014.",
  "/wiki/Franklin_Glacier_Complex": "The Franklin Glacier Complex is a deeply eroded volcano in the Waddington Range of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Located about 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) northeast of Kingcome, this sketchily known complex resides at Franklin Glacier near Mount Waddington. It is over 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) in elevation and because of its considerable overall altitude, a large proportion of the complex is covered by glacial ice.",

The cones are in the lee of the Lillooet Icecap and sit astride a group of passes between the Bridge River, which flows W-E to their south, and the Lord River, which flows north to the Taseko Lakes in the Chilcotin District.",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_field": "A volcanic field is an area of the Earth's crust that is prone to localized volcanic activity. They usually contain 10 to 100 volcanoes such as cinder cones and are usually in clusters. Lava flows may also occur. They may occur as a monogenetic volcanic field or a polygenetic volcanic field.",

Part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc of western North America, it is located 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) north of Vancouver at the northern end of the Pemberton Valley and reaches a maximum elevation of 2,680\u00a0m (8,790\u00a0ft). The massif is capped by several eroded volcanic edifices, including lava domes, volcanic plugs and overlapping piles of lava flows; these form at least six major summits including Mount Meager which is the second highest of the massif.",
  "/wiki/Complex_volcano": "A complex volcano, also called a compound volcano, is mixed landform consisting of related volcanic centers and their associated lava flows and pyroclastic rock. They may form due to changes in eruptive habit or in the location of the principal vent area on a particular volcano. Stratovolcanoes can also form a large caldera that gets filled in by a lava dome, or else multiple small cinder cones, lava domes and craters may develop on the caldera's rim.",
  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present (BP) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology, geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past. Because the \"present\" time changes, standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date (epoch) of the age scale,[a] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s. The abbreviation \"BP\" has been interpreted retrospectively as \"Before Physics\"; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, making dating after that time likely to be unreliable.",
  "/wiki/Ring_Mountain_(British_Columbia)": "Ring Mountain, also called Crucible Dome, is a tuya in the Mount Cayley volcanic field, British Columbia, Canada. It has a horseshoe shaped crater, located on the east side of the upper Squamish River. Outcrops on Ring Mountain's western side contain highly variable, fine-scale jointing and are locally broken down into many small spires and knobs. The age of Ring Mountain is unknown, but probably formed during the Fraser Glaciation like most tuyas in Canada.",
  "/wiki/Tuya": "A tuya is a type of distinctive, flat-topped, steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet.  They are somewhat rare worldwide, being confined to regions which were covered by glaciers and had active volcanism during the same period.",

Located 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) north of Squamish and 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) west of Whistler, the massif resides on the edge of the Powder Mountain Icefield. It consists of an eroded but potentially active stratovolcano that towers over the Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys. All major summits have elevations greater than 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft), Mount Cayley being the highest at 2,385\u00a0m (7,825\u00a0ft). The surrounding area has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for more than 7,000\u00a0years while geothermal exploration has taken place there for the last four decades.",
  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice and ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far, due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi).",

This mountain ridge represents the base of a north-south trending volcanic field which Mount Fee occupies.",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_plug": "A volcanic plug, also called a volcanic neck or lava neck, is a volcanic object created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano. When present, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of pressure if rising volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it, and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption. Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, while a long slope of material remains on the opposite side. Such landforms are called crag and tail. If a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains, producing a distinctive upstanding landform.",

Cinder Cone is surrounded by cinder flats and its crater is filled with meltwater during the summer. Cinder Cone is eroded easily by meltwater during the spring, washing the pyroclastics into the Valley of Desolation. Cinder Cone produced a 9\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) long lava flow during the early Holocene.",
  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as either volcanic clinkers, volcanic ash, or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent. The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical; with slopes between 30\u201340\u00b0; and a nearly circular ground plan.
