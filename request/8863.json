Several bids were made to take over the club but none were accepted by the administrators, and so on 3 January 2017 the club went into liquidation. Immediately the RFL announced the criteria and invited bids to form a \"new club\", which ultimately acted as an immediate resurrection of the Bulls which retained the history, club colours, badge, home stadium and several players from the 2016 squad. Due to the administration and liquidation, the club started the 2017 season with a 12-point deduction. With a few games left of the 2017 season, Bradford's relegation fears were confirmed and in 2018 they played in League One earning promotion back to the Championship after beating Workington Town on 7 October 2018.",

It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements, rapidly becoming the \"wool capital of the world\". The area's access to a supply of coal, iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford's manufacturing base, which, as textile manufacture grew, led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment; Bradford has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand Italianate City Hall.\n The textile sector in Bradford fell into decline from the mid-20th century. Bradford has since emerged as a tourist destination, becoming the first UNESCO City of Film with attractions such as the National Science and Media Museum, Bradford City Park, the Alhambra theatre and Cartwright Hall.
