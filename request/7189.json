Bailey was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives and served from 1814 to 1817; he served as a clerk in the Department of State in Washington, D.C. from 1817 until 1823.\n Bailey was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.\n Bailey presented credentials as a Member-elect to the Eighteenth Congress, but his election was contested on residency requirements. A House resolution on March 18, 1824 declared he was not entitled to the seat.\n Upon returning to Canton, Bailey was elected as an Adams-Clay Republican; his subsequent re-elections allowed him to serve the Nineteenth and Twentieth Congresses. During his tenure Bailey chaired the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State.\n Bailey ran as an Anti-Jacksonian in the Twenty-first Congress but was not a candidate for renomination in 1830.

  "/wiki/Pennsylvania's_13th_congressional_district": "The 13th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The district contains all of Blair County, Huntingdon County, Bedford County, Fulton County, Franklin County, and Adams County. It also includes most of Somerset County, and parts of Westmoreland County, Cambria County, and Cumberland County. Republican John Joyce has represented the district since 2019.\n Prior to February 2018, the district was located in southeastern Pennsylvania, covering eastern Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia.  The district traditionally included most of Montgomery County, but was redrawn in 2002 to include part of Philadelphia, and altered again in 2012. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional. The old 13th district became the 4th district, and what was the ninth district in the southwest part of the state was modified and redesignated the 13th district, for the 2018 elections and representation thereafter.\n The district had long been a Republican stronghold, like many suburban districts in the Northeast.  However, the brand of Republicanism in this district was a moderate one, and the district (like the Philadelphia suburbs as a whole) became friendlier to Democrats during the 1990s as the national party veered to the right.  The district has not voted Republican for President since 1988.  In 1992, the district elected its first Democratic representative in 86 years, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky.  She was swept out in 1994 by Republican Jon D. Fox, but Joe Hoeffel regained the seat for the Democrats in 1998.

  "/wiki/North_Carolina's_2nd_congressional_district": "North Carolina's 2nd congressional district is located in the central and eastern parts of the state. The district currently includes southern and eastern Wake County, northern Johnston County, southern Nash County, far western Wilson County, and all of Franklin and Harnett counties. The 2nd district has been represented by Republican Rep. George Holding since 2017. He is not running for re-election in 2020.\n Established by the state legislature after the American Civil War, the district was known as \"The Black Second;\" counties included in the district were mostly majority-black in population. All four of North Carolina's Republican African-American congressmen elected in the post-Civil War era (ending with George Henry White) represented this district, as did white yeoman farmer Curtis Hooks Brogden of Wayne County, a Republican ally of former Governor William Woods Holden.\n After North Carolina Democrats regained control of the state legislature in the 1870s (using intimidation by the Red Shirts and other paramilitary groups to reduce the number of blacks voting), they passed voter registration and electoral laws that restricted voter rolls. Blacks continued to get elected to local and state offices. The state legislature passed a new constitutional amendment in 1900, which effectively disfranchised blacks altogether. This ended the election of blacks to local, state or Congressional offices until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, which enforced constitutional voting rights.\n Thousands of blacks migrated north from the state in the Great Migration during the first half of the twentieth century, seeking job opportunities and education. By the later twentieth century, before the 1990s, the 2nd district was roughly 40% black. While it had the highest percentage of black residents of any congressional district in North Carolina, African-American candidates were unable to get elected to Congress from the majority-white district.\n State redistricting following census changes led to the creation of the black-majority 1st and 12th districts and drew off some black population from the 2nd. Today the proportion of African-American residents is about 20.11% in the 2nd District.",

Some sources indicate that he was not affiliated with any party at the time, although he was associated, according to other sources, with the Federalist Party and later with the National Republican Party.\n There is some uncertainty as to the time and place of Burton's birth. Burton appears to have been born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia in 1774. However, some sources also give his birth year as 1782. Burton was sent to Granville County, North Carolina (now Vance County) to live with his uncle, Revolutionary War Colonel and politician Robert Burton, when his father died.  Young Burton went on to practice law, serve in the North Carolina General Assembly, and be elected by that body as North Carolina Attorney General. He served as Attorney General from 1810 until his resignation in 1816.\n Burton moved to Halifax Town in 1817 and practiced law. He was elected to the state House of Commons on August 14, 1817 and served a single one-year term. On August 12, 1819, Burton was elected to the United States House of Representatives for the term 1819\u20131821. He was supported both by the Federalists, who were strong in Halifax Town, and also by the Democratic-Republican Party. Burton was re-elected in 1821 and 1823. He resigned from Congress on March 23, 1824.\n The North Carolina state legislature elected Burton the Governor of the state in 1824 and re-elected him in 1825 and 1826.

Hutchins Burton, Outlaw was sent to the 18th U.S. Congress in a special election; he served for less than two months in Congress, from January 19, 1825 to March 3, 1825. Outlaw was defeated in his campaign for re-election by Willis Alston in a three-way race. Alston, who had served previously from 1799 to 1815, criticized Outlaw's vote for William H. Crawford in the contingent presidential election of 1825. Outlaw's vote reflected the vote of the 2d Congressional District (which had voted Crawford 1,516 to Jackson 957), but the voters agreed with Alston and elected him over Outlaw by a 42-31% margin (with an Adams supporter winning 27%).  Afterwards, he resumed agricultural and mercantile pursuits and died in Windsor in 1825, where he is buried in his family cemetery.\n Outlaw was the cousin of Rep. David Outlaw.",
