  "/wiki/Impact_crater": "An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain.  Impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  Meteor Crater is a well-known example of a small impact crater on Earth.\n Impact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids. On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io and Titan, visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded, buried or transformed by tectonics over time. Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography, the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.\n The cratering records of very old surfaces, such as Mercury, the Moon, and the southern highlands of Mars, record a period of intense early bombardment in the inner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago. The rate of crater production on Earth has since been considerably lower, but it is appreciable nonetheless; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce a 20-kilometre-diameter (12\u00a0mi) crater about once every million years on average. This indicates that there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have been discovered so far. The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates as a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of fragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system.  Formed in a collision 80 million years ago, the Baptistina family of asteroids is thought to have caused a large spike in the impact rate. Note that the rate of impact cratering in the outer Solar System could be different from the inner Solar System.\n Although Earth's active surface processes quickly destroy the impact record, about 190 terrestrial impact craters have been identified. These range in diameter from a few tens of meters up to about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi), and they range in age from recent times (e.g. the Sikhote-Alin craters in Russia whose creation was witnessed in 1947) to more than two billion years, though most are less than 500 million years old because geological processes tend to obliterate older craters. They are also selectively found in the stable interior regions of continents. Few undersea craters have been discovered because of the difficulty of surveying the sea floor, the rapid rate of change of the ocean bottom, and the subduction of the ocean floor into Earth's interior by processes of plate tectonics.\n Impact craters are not to be confused with landforms that may appear similar, including calderas, sinkholes, glacial cirques, ring dikes, salt domes, and others.",
  "/wiki/Vallis_Alpes": "Vallis Alpes (Latin for \"Alpine Valley\") is a lunar valley feature that bisects the Montes Alpes range. It extends 166\u00a0km from the Mare Imbrium basin, trending east-northeast to the edge of the Mare Frigoris. The valley is narrow at both ends and widens to a maximum width of about 10\u00a0km along the middle stretch. The selenographic coordinates of the center of this feature are 49\u00b013\u2032N 3\u00b038\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff49.21\u00b0N 3.63\u00b0E\ufeff / 49.21; 3.63.\n The valley floor is a flat, lava-flooded surface that is bisected by a slender, broken, cleft-like rille.  The center rille is a challenging target for telescope observation from the Earth and described as, \"notoriously hard to spot.\"  The rille itself is longer than the valley proper, at 196.65\u00a0km \u00b1 10.98\u00a0km, and has a width of 0.58\u00a0km \u00b1 0.09\u00a0km and depth of 77.69 m \u00b1 28.07 m.\n The sides of the valley rise from the floor to the surrounding highland terrain, a blocky, irregular surface. The southern face of the valley is straighter than the northern side, which is slightly bowed and uneven. The more rugged edges of the valley lie at the narrow west-southwest end that cuts through the mountain range.\n Most likely this valley is a graben that was subsequently flooded with magma from Mare Imbrium and Mare Frigoris.  However, the valley could have been formed by stress fractures due to expansion of the mantle or contraction after solidification of regolith.  It is not dissimilar to other linear features radiating from Mare Imbrium, and the impact event which created the Imbrium basin may have also led to the stresses creating Vallis Alpes.  Lava flooding and thermal or tensional stress fractures are two causes of graben formation.\n This valley was discovered in 1727 by Francesco Bianchini. Its name was confirmed by the International Astronomical Union in 1961.",

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet.\n Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome, known as Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire. Latin has contributed many words to the English language. In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek) roots are used in English descriptions of theology, the sciences, medicine, and law.\n By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius. Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages, such as French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries. Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin. Later, Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved. Latin was used as the language of international communication, scholarship and science until well into the 18th century, when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars (including the Romance languages). Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church.\n Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders, up to seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects and two numbers.",

Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.\n Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.\n Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element bohrium was named after him.\n During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from Nazism. After Denmark was occupied by the Germans, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Ris\u00f8 of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.",

  "/wiki/Schr\u00f6ter_(lunar_crater)": "Schr\u00f6ter is a lunar impact crater near the mid-part of the Moon, on the eastern Mare Insularum. It was named after German astronomer Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter. It lies to the north of the craters S\u00f6mmering and M\u00f6sting. To the southeast of the crater rim is a rille named the Rima Schr\u00f6ter. This cleft begins at a small crater in the mare, then follows a line to the south-southeast.\n The rim of Schr\u00f6ter is heavily worn and eroded, with a wide gap in the southern wall and a deep indentation to the southeast. There is no central peak at the crater's midpoint. A widely spaced row of tiny craters forms a line westwards from the north rim of Schr\u00f6ter.\n Professor W. H. Pickering produced drawings of this crater displaying eruptions of steam that he believed he witnessed. This transient lunar phenomenon was not confirmed by other observers.\n To the north of Schr\u00f6ter, beginning with the satellite crater Schr\u00f6ter W, is a region of irregular terrain. This area includes an array of linear dark surface markings that appear to criss-cross. In the 19th century, Franz von Gruithuisen is noted for claiming that this area contained a lunar city (which he called Wallwerk), based on his observations using a small refracting telescope. This inference was greeted with considerable skepticism by astronomers at the time, and, indeed, subsequent observations with more powerful instruments demonstrated that this was merely a natural feature.\n About 100\u00a0km to the west-northwest of Schr\u00f6ter is the crash site of Surveyor 2.",
  "/wiki/Vallis_Snellius": "Vallis Snellius is a linear valley on the near side of the Moon. It is located in the rugged southeastern part of the visible surface, to the south of the Mare Fecunditatis. This feature is radial to the Mare Nectaris basin to the west-northwest, much like Vallis Rheita to the southwest, and the two likely share a common origin. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 31\u00b006\u2032S 56\u00b000\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff31.1\u00b0S 56.0\u00b0E\ufeff / -31.1; 56.0, and it has a maximum length of 592\u00a0km, making it the longest named valley on the Moon.\n Although linear, this valley is irregular in shape and has been heavily worn by impact erosion, making it difficult to trace across the surface. The crater  Snellius from which it is named lies across the valley, which cuts through the southern half of the crater floor. Near the northern part of the valley is the crater Borda.",
  "/wiki/Willebrord_Snell": "Willebrord Snellius (born Willebrord Snel van Royen) (13 June 1580\u00a0\u2013 30 October 1626) was a Dutch astronomer and mathematician, known in the English-speaking world as Snell. In the west, especially the English speaking countries, his name is attached to the law of refraction of light.  (It is now known that this law was already known to Ibn Sahl in 984. The same law was also investigated by Ptolemy and in the Middle Ages by Witelo, but due to lack of adequate mathematical instruments (trigonometric functions) their results were saved as tables, not functions.)\n The lunar crater Snellius is named after Willebrord Snellius. The Royal Netherlands Navy has named three survey ships after Snellius, including a currently-serving vessel.",
  "/wiki/Snellius_(crater)": "Snellius is a lunar impact crater located near the southeast limb of the Moon.\n The rim of Snellius is heavily worn and eroded, with overlapping craterlets. The floor is somewhat irregular and uneven. The western rim marks the start of the Vallis Snellius, one of the longest valleys on the Moon. It continues nearly 500 kilometers to the northwest to near the edge of Mare Nectaris. Its origin is most likely associated with the formation of the lunar mare.\n To the northeast is the large crater Petavius. South of Snellius is the crater Stevinus.  Just to the northwest is Snellius A, a crater with a notable ray system that overlaps the southwest reaches of Mare Fecunditatis to the north.\n It is named after Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicist, Willebrord Snellius.",
