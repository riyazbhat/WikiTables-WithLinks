  "/wiki/Film": "Film, also called movie or motion picture or (less widely) The Seventh Art, is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere, by the means of recorded or programmed[vague] moving images, along with sound (and more rarely) other sensory stimulations. The word cinema, short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it. The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects. Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected). Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating\u2014or indoctrinating\u2014citizens.",

It lies on the northern tip of Lake Annecy, 35 kilometers (22 mi) south of Geneva. Nicknamed the Pearl of French Alps in Raoul Blanchard's monograph describing its location between lake and mountains, the city controls the northern entrance to the lake gorge.

However, the 2017 merger with several ex-communes extended the city population to 124,401 inhabitants, and 203,078 for its urban area, placing Annecy 6th in the region, behind Annemasse, which has 292,000 inhabitants. Switching from counts of Geneva's dwelling in the 13th century, to counts of Savoy's in the 14th century, the city became Savoy's capital in 1434 during the Genevois-Nemours prerogative until 1659. Its role increased in 1536, during the Calvinist Reformation in Geneva, while the bishop took refuge in Annecy.
