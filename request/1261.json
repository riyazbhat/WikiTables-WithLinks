There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In 1991, the US version of the album Classic Queen was released following the band's increase in popularity in the nation. In the years after its release, Greatest Hits became a commercial success worldwide with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, spending four weeks at the top and sold consistently well throughout the 1980s, becoming the fourth-biggest selling album of the decade. In the United States, the album sold moderately well on initial release in 1981. The single Under Pressure, Queen's collaboration with David Bowie which was released the same week as Greatest Hits, also topped the UK Singles Chart. Although initial reviews of Greatest Hits by British critics were negative, retrospective reviews have rated the album higher. British journalist Brian Viner called it the greatest album of all time.

  "/wiki/Queen_(band)": "Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock. Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name Queen. Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured Bohemian Rhapsody, which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album News of the World contained We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions, which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world.",

  "/wiki/Rumours_(album)": "Rumours is the eleventh studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records.

The band wanted to expand on the commercial success of their eponymous 1975 album, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonism and strife among band members that shaped the album's lyrics. Recorded with the intention of making a pop album, the album's music featured a pop rock and soft rock sound characterized by accented rhythms and electric keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes or Hammond B3 organ. The members partied and used cocaine for much of the recording sessions, and its completion was delayed by its mixing process, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours. Rumours reached the top of both the US Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart, and became the band's most successful release. The songs Go Your Own Way, Dreams, Don't Stop, and You Make Loving Fun were released as singles, all of which reached the US top 10.

Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. A concept album, its themes explore conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. The group used recording techniques such as multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew, as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on The Great Gig in the Sky. The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a simple and bold design, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: Money and Us and Them. The Dark Side of the Moon received critical acclaim upon release, and has since been hailed by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time.

This did not stop him from becoming one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million records. The key to this success was his retention of iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the United Kingdom, where he received the 1994 Brit Award for best-selling album and single, appeared in the 1997 film Spice World, and ranks 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts, as of 2006. [update] He ranks 96th on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. Sometimes credited as Meat Loaf Aday, he has also appeared in over 50 movies and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona.

The rules preventing titles older than 18 months to chart on the Billboard 200 were subsequently changed in the fall of 2009 due to the posthumous success of Jackson, as well as The Beatles re-mastered re-releases.

  "/wiki/The_Immaculate_Collection": "The Immaculate Collection is a greatest hits album by American recording artist Madonna, released on November 9, 1990 by Sire Records. It contains new remixes of fifteen of her hit singles from 1983 to 1990, as well as the new tracks Justify My Love and Rescue Me. Its title is a loose pun on the Immaculate Conception, the conception of the Virgin Mary without the stain of original sin (Madonna was raised as a Roman Catholic). The extended play The Holiday Collection was issued in Europe to accompany the compilation and the re-release of the single Holiday. It is the first album ever to use the audio technology QSound. Justify My Love, the album's first single, became Madonna's ninth number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, and was one of her most controversial singles due to its sexually explicit music video. Rescue Me was released as the second single and became the highest-debuting single on Hot 100 by a female artist at that time, entering the chart at number fifteen and peaking at number nine. The Immaculate Collection became Madonna's second album to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over ten million copies in the United States. It also spent the second highest number of consecutive weeks at number one for a female solo artist in the UK, being at number one for a nine-week stint. The album has sold 31 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist and one of the best-selling albums of all time.",
  "/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)": "Madonna Louise Ciccone (/t\u0283\u026a\u02c8ko\u028ani/, Italian: [t\u0283ik\u02c8ko\u02d0ne]; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. Referred to as the Queen of Pop since the 1980s, Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in mainstream popular music and for the imagery she uses onstage and in music videos. She has frequently reinvented her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry. Her works have been praised by music critics and have sparked controversy. Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists. Born and raised in Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including global bestsellers Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986) as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Many of her songs have reached the top of record charts worldwide, including Like a Virgin, La Isla Bonita, Like a Prayer, Vogue, Take a Bow, Frozen, Music, Hung Up, and 4 Minutes. Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While Evita earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded an entertainment company called Maverick (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992.",
  "/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Foo_Fighters_album)": "Greatest Hits is a greatest hits album released by American rock band the Foo Fighters on November 3, 2009.",
  "/wiki/Foo_Fighters": "Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the suicide of Kurt Cobain. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007.",
  "/wiki/Definitely_Maybe": "Definitely Maybe is the debut studio album by English rock band Oasis. The album was released on 29 August 1994 by Creation Records. Definitely Maybe was an immediate commercial and critical success in the United Kingdom, having followed on the heels of the singles Supersonic, Shakermaker, and Live Forever. The album went straight to number one in the UK Albums Chart and became the fastest-selling debut album in the UK at the time; it went on to be certified 7\u00d7 Platinum (2.1 million+ sales) by the BPI. Definitely Maybe marked the beginning of Oasis's success in the United States, selling over one million copies there despite only peaking at 58 on the Billboard 200. The album went on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide and brought widespread critical acclaim. Definitely Maybe helped to spur a revitalisation in British pop music in the 1990s and was embraced by critics for its optimistic themes and supposed rejection of the grunge music of the time. The album is regarded as a seminal entry of the Britpop scene, and has appeared in many publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2006, the NME conducted a readers' poll in which Definitely Maybe was voted the greatest album of all time.",
  "/wiki/Nevermind": "Nevermind is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. A number of labels courted the band, but Nirvana ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon repeated recommendations from Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and their management company. Produced by Butch Vig, it was the band's first release on the label, as well as the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. The album cover, which shows a naked baby swimming with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach, is often considered as one of the most famous album covers in popular music. For the preparation of Nevermind, Cobain wrote a number of songs that were influenced by bands like The Melvins, R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. A key development was the single Sliver, released on Sub Pop in 1990, which Cobain said was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that. Despite the initial low commercial expectations, Nevermind became an unexpected breakout success. In January 1992, it reached number one on the US Billboard 200. The lead single Smells Like Teen Spirit was a critical success and peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100. Three other successful singles were produced: Come as You Are, Lithium, and In Bloom.",
  "/wiki/Nirvana_(band)": "Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. It was founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting and best-known being Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture. In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with Smells Like Teen Spirit, the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nirvana's sudden success popularized alternative rock, and Cobain found himself described as the spokesman of a generation and Nirvana the flagship band of Generation X. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, Nirvana released their third studio album, In Utero (1993), to critical acclaim and further chart success. Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than Nevermind, it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994.",

  "/wiki/Simon_&_Garfunkel": "Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk-rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. One of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s, their biggest hits - including The Sound of Silence (1965), Mrs. Robinson (1968), The Boxer (1969), and Bridge over Troubled Water (1970) - reached number one on singles charts worldwide. Simon and Garfunkel met in elementary school in Queens, New York, in 1953, where they learned to harmonize together and began writing material. By 1957, under the name Tom & Jerry, the teenagers had their first minor success with Hey Schoolgirl, a song imitating their idols the Everly Brothers. In 1963, aware of a growing public interest in folk music, they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon & Garfunkel. Their debut, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., sold poorly, and they once again disbanded; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. In June 1965, a new version of The Sound of Silence overdubbed with electric guitar and drums became a major U.S. AM radio hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The duo reunited to release a second studio album, Sounds of Silence, and tour colleges nationwide. On their third release, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), the duo assumed more creative control. Their music was featured in the 1967 film The Graduate, giving them further exposure. Their next album Bookends (1968) topped the Billboard 200 chart and included the number-one single Mrs. Robinson from the film. The duo's often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements and their breakup in 1970.",
  "/wiki/Bridge_over_Troubled_Water": "Bridge over Troubled Water is the fifth and final studio album by American folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, released in January 1970 on Columbia Records. Following the duo's soundtrack for The Graduate, Art Garfunkel took an acting role in the film Catch-22, while Paul Simon worked on the songs, writing all tracks except Felice and Boudleaux Bryant's Bye Bye Love (previously a hit for the Everly Brothers). With the help of producer Roy Halee, the album followed a similar musical pattern as their Bookends, partly abandoning their traditional style to incorporate elements of rock, R&B, gospel, jazz, world music, pop and other genres. It was described as their most effortless record and their most ambitious. Bridge over Troubled Water was released on January 26, 1970, and several re-releases followed. The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. Columbia Records released a 40th Anniversary Edition on March 8, 2011, which includes two DVDs, including the politically themed TV special Songs of America (1969), the documentary The Harmony Game, additional liner notes and a booklet. Other reissues contain bonus tracks, such as the 2001 version, which covers the demo tapes of Feuilles-O and Bridge over Troubled Water. Despite numerous accolades, the duo decided to split up, and parted company later in 1970; Garfunkel continued his film career, while Simon worked intensely with music. Both artists released solo albums in the following years. Bridge includes two of the duo's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful songs, Bridge over Troubled Water and The Boxer, which were listed on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Critically and commercially successful, the album topped the charts in over ten countries and received two Grammy Awards, plus four more for the title song.",
