The text is written in the form of a prose and verse travel diary and was penned as Bash\u014d made an epic and dangerous journey on foot through the Edo Japan of the late 17th century. While the poetic work became seminal of its own account, the poet's travels in the text have since inspired many people to follow in his footsteps and trace his journey for themselves. In one of its most memorable passages, Bash\u014d suggests that every day is a journey, and the journey itself home. The text was also influenced by the works of Du Fu, who was highly revered by Bash\u014d.
