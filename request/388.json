Its economy depends on tourism, being a popular destination for short drives from the Gold Coast and Brisbane. Canungra, also called the Valley of the Owls, is situated in the Gold Coast hinterland, 32 kilometres (20 mi) west of the Gold Coast and 75 kilometres (47 mi) south of Brisbane. At the 2016 census, Canungra had a population of 1229. One of the origins of the town's name comes from the Aboriginal word for small owls, Caningera. The most notable owl found in the area is the Australian boobook owl, which appears in various logos and symbols associated with Canungra. In 2005, the local Post Office released a special limited-release frank featuring Canungra and the boobook owl. However the word Cunungra comes from the Yugambeh word gungunga meaning a long flat or clearing. Residents and businesses in Canungra get their water supply from the Canungra Creek, a tributary of the Albert River. The slopes around Canungra are steep and forested, with some cleared farmlands and rural homes in the flatter valley areas.",

It was created in 2008 from a merger of the Shire of Esk and the Shire of Kilcoy. It is commonly known as the Brisbane Valley, due to the Brisbane River which courses through the region, although significant parts of the region lie outside the hydrological Brisbane Valley itself. The Esk and Kilcoy Shires were amalgamated to consolidate the water catchments for the Wivenhoe and Somerset Dams. The Local Government Reform Commission identified that the long-term future of Somerset would be as a major water catchment for the SEQ region with farming being the main economic activity within a water catchment management regime. The planning strategy and land use policies implemented by the Somerset Regional Council are therefore directed this end. The Somerset Regional Council, which administers the region, has an estimated operating budget of A$50 million. (Council's 2011/2012 budget adopted in June 2012 showed total operating revenue of A$50,049,250).
