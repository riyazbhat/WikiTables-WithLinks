It was also called Wash\u016b (\u548c\u5dde). Yamato consists of two characters, \u5927 great, and \u548c Wa. At first, the name was written with one different character (\u5927\u502d), but due to its offensive connotation, for about ten years after 737, this was revised to use more desirable characters (\u5927\u990a\u5fb3) (see Names of Japan). The final revision was made in the second year of the Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji era (c. 758). It is classified as a great province in the Engishiki. The Yamato Period in the history of Japan refers to the late Kofun Period (c. 250-538) and Asuka Period (538-710). Japanese archaeologists and historians emphasize the fact that during the early Kofun Period the Yamato chieftainship was in close contention with other regional powers, such as Kibi Province near present-day Okayama Prefecture. Around the 6th century, the local chieftainship gained national control and established the Imperial court in Yamato Province. The battleship Yamato, the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet during World War II, was named after this ancient province.",

Tokyo forms part of the Kant\u014d region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu, and includes the Izu and Ogasawara Islands. Originally a small fishing village named Edo (\u6c5f\u6238), the city became a prominent political center of Japan when Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603. When Emperor Meiji moved the imperial seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868, Edo was renamed Tokyo, literally the Eastern Capital. The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (\u6771\u4eac\u5e9c, T\u014dky\u014d-fu) and the city of Tokyo (\u6771\u4eac\u5e02, T\u014dky\u014d-shi).

The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from Kanbe (\u795e\u6238, an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine). Kobe became one of Japan's designated cities in 1956. Kobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe's prominence as a port city, it remains Japan's fourth-busiest container port.

Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty. The Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was the most populous city in the world in its day. The L\u01d0 family (\u674e) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne, proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant.

Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people. [b] With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road.

It was extremely influential in East Asia, but most likely of considerably less importance in the Indian and Tibetan sub-traditions of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. The word nirde\u015ba in the title means instruction, advice, and Vimalak\u012brti is the name of the main protagonist of the text, and means Taintless Fame. The sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nondualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha, the characteristically Mah\u0101y\u0101na claim that the appearances of the world are mere illusions, and the superiority of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na over other paths. It places in the mouth of the up\u0101saka (lay practitioner) Vimalak\u012brti a teaching addressed to both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101. In most versions, the discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence. Translator Burton Watson argues that the Vimalak\u012brti Nirde\u015ba was likely composed in approximately 100 CE. Although it had been thought lost for centuries, a version in Sanskrit was recovered in 1999 among the manuscripts of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. The Sanskrit was published in parallel with the Tibetan and three Chinese versions by the Study Group on Buddhist Sanskrit Literature at the Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Buddhism at Taisho University in 2004, and in 2006, the same group published a critical edition that has become the standard version of the Sanskrit for scholarly purposes.

Goryeo achieved what has been called a true national unification by Korean historians as it not only unified the Later Three Kingdoms but also incorporated much of the ruling class of the northern kingdom of Balhae, who had origins in Goguryeo of the earlier Three Kingdoms of Korea. The name Korea is derived from the name of Goryeo, also spelled Kory\u014f, which was first used in the early 5th century by Goguryeo. The once prosperous kingdom of Later Silla, which had ruled much of the Korean Peninsula since the late 7th century, began crumbling by the late 9th century due to internal turmoil, leading to the revival of the ancient states of Baekje and Goguryeo, known in historiography as Later Baekje and Later Goguryeo. Later Goguryeo, also known as Taebong, was overthrown from within in 918 by Wang Geon, a prominent general of noble Goguryeo descent, who established Goryeo in its place. Goryeo peacefully annexed Later Silla in 935 and militarily conquered Later Baekje in 936, successfully reunifying the Korean Peninsula. Beginning in 993, Goryeo faced multiple invasions by the Khitan Liao dynasty, a powerful nomadic empire to the north, but a decisive military victory in 1019 brought about a century of peace and prosperity as Goryeo entered its golden age.

The Goryeo period was the golden age of Buddhism in Korea, and as the national religion, Buddhism achieved its highest level of influence in Korean history, with 70 temples in the capital alone in the 11th century. Commerce flourished in Goryeo, with merchants coming from as far as the Middle East, and the capital in modern-day Kaesong, North Korea was a center of trade and industry, with merchants employing a system of double-entry bookkeeping since the 11th or 12th century. In addition, Goryeo was a period of great achievements in Korean art and culture, such as Kory\u014f celadon, which was highly praised in the Song dynasty, and the Tripitaka Koreana, which was described by UNESCO as one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world, with the original 81,258 engraved printing blocks still preserved at Haeinsa Temple. In the early 13th century, Goryeo developed movable type made of metal to print books, 200 years before Johannes Gutenberg in Europe.",

In 794, Kyoto (then known as Heian-ky\u014d) was chosen as the new seat of Japan's imperial court. The Emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869, when the court relocated to Tokyo. The city was devastated during the \u014cnin War in the 15th century and went into an extended period of decline, but gradually revived under the Tokugawa shogunate (1600-1868) and flourished as a major city in Japan. The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889. The city was spared from large-scale destruction during World War II and as a result, its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved. Kyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and a major tourist destination. It is home to numerous Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens, many of which are listed collectively by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
