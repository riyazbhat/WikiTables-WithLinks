  "/wiki/Public_Policy": "Public policy is the process by which governments translate their political vision into programmes and actions to deliver \u2018outcomes \u2014 desired changes in the real world\u2019. The \u2018real world\u2019 is constantly changing and this has resulted in the movement towards greater use of evidence in policy design, making and implementation. Rational choice theory, or now more frequently known as evidence-based policy, argues that focusing on scientific evidence, instead of history and culture, should guide our public policy making.",

Regional planning can be comprehensive by covering various subjects, but it more often specifies a particular subject, which requires region-wide consideration.",
