  "/wiki/Butte,_Montana": "Butte is the county seat of Silver Bow County, Montana, United States. In 1977, the city and county governments consolidated to form the sole entity of Butte-Silver Bow. The city covers 718 square miles (1,860 km2), and, according to the 2010 census, has a population of 33,503, making it Montana's fifth largest city. It is served by Bert Mooney Airport with airport code BTM. Established in 1864 as a mining camp in the northern Rocky Mountains on the Continental Divide, Butte experienced rapid development in the late-nineteenth century, and was Montana's first major industrial city. In its heyday between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, it was one of the largest copper boomtowns in the American West. Employment opportunities in the mines attracted surges of Asian and European immigrants, particularly the Irish; as of 2017, Butte has the largest population of Irish Americans per capita of any city in the United States. Butte was also the site of various historical events involving its mining industry and active labor unions and Socialist politics, the most famous of which was the labor riot of 1914.",
  "/wiki/Butte,_Anaconda_and_Pacific_Railway_Historic_District": "The Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway Historic District is a 750 acres (300 ha) historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  It covers the railway right-of-way which begins in Butte, Montana and runs to Anaconda generally along the course of Silver Bow Creek.  It spans parts of Deer Lodge and Silver Bow counties.  The listing included 51 contributing buildings, 34 contributing structures, and two contributing sites.\n\n It covers resources associated with the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway.\n A Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway Historic District (Boundary Increase) added some Western rustic architecture in or near Durant, Montana.

  "/wiki/Continental_Divide": "The Continental Divide of the Americas (also known as the Great Divide, the Western Divide or simply the Continental Divide; Spanish: Divisoria continental de Am\u00e9rica, Gran Divisoria) is the principal, and largely mountainous, hydrological divide of the Americas.  The Continental Divide extends from the Bering Strait to the Strait of Magellan, and separates the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean from those river systems that drain into the Atlantic Ocean (including those that drain into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea) and, along the northernmost reaches of the Divide, those river systems that drain into the Arctic Ocean.\n Although there are many other hydrological divides in the Americas, the Continental Divide is by far the most prominent of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, at a generally much higher elevation than the other hydrological divisions.",
  "/wiki/Homestake_Pass": "Homestake Pass is a mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the United States. It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Jefferson County and Silver Bow County, six miles south-southeast of Butte in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest at an elevation of 6,329 feet (1,929 m). The pass carries Interstate 90 across the Continental Divide and is the highest point on the 3,020 mi (4,861 km) highway. The pass was discovered by Edwin Harrison McHenry, a civil engineer working for the Northern Pacific Railway, who was tasked with locating a route for the NP from the main line near Logan, Montana through to Butte. The line over the pass from Logan to Garrison, Montana via Butte became the Rocky Mountain Division, Second and Fourth Subdivisions, built in 1889. This was Northern Pacific's scenic transcontinental passenger train route used by the famous North Coast Limited and its Amtrak successor, the North Coast Hiawatha, which was discontinued in 1979. The line over the pass is currently owned by BNSF Railway. It has been inactive since 1983, as its grades and curvature are poorly suited to freight trains, which (now operated by Montana Rail Link) utilize the former Northern Pacific's easier route via Helena.",
  "/wiki/Beaverhead-Deerlodge_National_Forest": "The Beaverhead\u2013Deerlodge National Forest is the largest of the National Forests in Montana, United States. Covering 3.36 million acres (13,600 km2), the forest is broken into nine separate sections and stretches across eight counties in the southwestern area of the state. President Theodore Roosevelt named the two forests in 1908 and they were merged in 1996. Forest headquarters are located in Dillon, Montana. In Roosevelt's original legislation, the Deerlodge National Forest was called the Big Hole Forest Reserve. He created this reserve because the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, based in Butte, Montana, had begun to clearcut the upper Big Hole River watershed. The subsequent erosion, exacerbated by smoke pollution from the Anaconda smelter, was devastating the region. Ranchers and conservationists alike complained to Roosevelt, who made several trips to the area.",
  "/wiki/Matt's_Place_Drive-In": "Matt's Place Drive-In in Butte, Montana is one of the first drive-in restaurants in Montana. Unlike later drive-ins, which frequently featured a streamline moderne style, or at least an acknowledgement of their orientation to automobile-oriented customers, Matt's Place was a straightforward conversion of a house to serve customers in cars.  Established in 1930, its chief concession to the automobile is a tall curb to keep parking cars from hitting the building and a menu on the outside of the building, advertising curb service.  The interior retains its 1936 counter and 1950s lighting fixtures.\n They were awarded the 2016 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award.",

Prior to the mid-1970s, US 91 was an international commerce route from Long Beach, California to the Canada\u2013US border north of Sweetgrass, Montana. US 91 was routed on the main streets of most of the communities it served, including Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas and State Street in Salt Lake City. From Los Angeles to Salt Lake, the route was built along the corridor of the Arrowhead Trail. US 91 has been largely replaced by Interstate 15.

  "/wiki/Socialist_Hall": "The Socialist Hall in Butte, Montana is one of the few socialist halls remaining in the United States. Erected in 1916, when the Socialist movement was strong in the city, it was active for only a few years until socialism fell out of favor amidst persecution of socialists and labor unionists including the Anaconda Road Massacre and the lynching of Frank Little.\n During its brief time of service, the Industrial Workers of the World met here, also holding meetings in Butte's Finlander Hall.\n Today a sporting goods shop occupies the first floor of the former Socialist Hall.
