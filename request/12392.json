  "/wiki/Montana_Highway_43": "The state highways in Montana are the state highways owned and maintained by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) in the US state of Montana.\n Montana's state highways are classified as either primary or secondary. Several of Montana's state highways (both primary and secondary), or sections thereof, have also been designated as part of the National Highway System.",
  "/wiki/Butte,_Montana": "Butte is the county seat of Silver Bow County, Montana, United States. In 1977, the city and county governments consolidated to form the sole entity of Butte-Silver Bow. The city covers 718 square miles (1,860\u00a0km2), and, according to the 2010 census, has a population of 33,503, making it Montana's fifth largest city. It is served by Bert Mooney Airport with airport code BTM.\n Established in 1864 as a mining camp in the northern Rocky Mountains on the Continental Divide, Butte experienced rapid development in the late-nineteenth century, and was Montana's first major industrial city. In its heyday between the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, it was one of the largest copper boomtowns in the American West. Employment opportunities in the mines attracted surges of Asian and European immigrants, particularly the Irish; as of 2017, Butte has the largest population of Irish Americans per capita of any city in the United States.\n Butte was also the site of various historical events involving its mining industry and active labor unions and Socialist politics, the most famous of which was the labor riot of 1914. Despite the dominance of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, Butte was never a company town. Other major events in the city's history include the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster, the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history.\n Over the course of its history, Butte's mining and smelting operations generated an excess of $48 billion worth of ore, but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city: The upper Clark Fork River, with headwaters at Butte, is the largest Superfund site in the United States, and the city is also home to the Berkeley Pit. In the late-twentieth century, cleanup efforts from the EPA were instated, and the Butte Citizens Technical Environmental Committee was established in 1984. In the 21st century, efforts at interpreting and preserving Butte's heritage are addressing both the town's historical significance and the continuing importance of mining to its economy and culture. The city's Uptown Historic District, on the National Register of Historic Places, is one of the largest National Historic Landmark Districts in the United States, containing nearly 6,000 contributing properties. The city is also home to Montana Tech, a public engineering and technical university.",
  "/wiki/Butte,_Anaconda_and_Pacific_Railway_Historic_District": "The Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway Historic District is a 750 acres (300\u00a0ha) historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  It covers the railway right-of-way which begins in Butte, Montana and runs to Anaconda generally along the course of Silver Bow Creek.  It spans parts of Deer Lodge and Silver Bow counties.  The listing included 51 contributing buildings, 34 contributing structures, and two contributing sites.\n\n It covers resources associated with the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway.\n A Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway Historic District (Boundary Increase) added some Western rustic architecture in or near Durant, Montana.  The boundary increase added eight contributing buildings on 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) at the confluence of German Gulch and Silver Bow Creek at the east end of Silver Bow Canyon.\n The district may have been incorporated into the huge Butte-Anaconda Historic District when that district was expanded in 2006.",

  "/wiki/W._A._Clark_Mansion": "The Copper King Mansion, also known as the W. A. Clark Mansion, is a 34-room residence of Romanesque Revival Victorian architecture that was built from 1884 to 1888 as the Butte, Montana, residence of William Andrews Clark, one of Montana's three famous Copper Kings.  The home features fresco painted ceilings, elegant parquets of rare imported wood, gas and electric chandeliers, ornate hand-carved fireplaces and stairways, and stained-glass windows.  The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\n The Copper King Mansion has been privately owned, operated, and occupied by the Cote family since 1953. The home is operated as a bed and breakfast. Guided tours are available at 10am,12,2,and 3:30pm during the summer tourist season, or by appointment during the winter months. The home underwent restoration in 2012.\n The building of the Copper King Mansion is described in the bestselling biography of Clark's daughter, Huguette, Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune by Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell, Jr.",
  "/wiki/Continental_Divide": "The Continental Divide of the Americas (also known as the Great Divide, the Western Divide or simply the Continental Divide; Spanish: Divisoria continental de Am\u00e9rica, Gran Divisoria) is the principal, and largely mountainous, hydrological divide of the Americas.  The Continental Divide extends from the Bering Strait to the Strait of Magellan, and separates the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean from those river systems that drain into the Atlantic Ocean (including those that drain into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea) and, along the northernmost reaches of the Divide, those river systems that drain into the Arctic Ocean.\n Although there are many other hydrological divides in the Americas, the Continental Divide is by far the most prominent of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, at a generally much higher elevation than the other hydrological divisions.",
  "/wiki/Homestake_Pass": "Homestake Pass is a mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the United States. It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Jefferson County and Silver Bow County, six miles south-southeast of Butte in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest at an elevation of 6,329 feet (1,929\u00a0m). The pass carries Interstate 90 across the Continental Divide and is the highest point on the 3,020\u00a0mi (4,861\u00a0km) highway.\n The pass was discovered by Edwin Harrison McHenry, a civil engineer working for the Northern Pacific Railway, who was tasked with locating a route for the NP from the main line near Logan, Montana through to Butte. The line over the pass from Logan to Garrison, Montana via Butte became the Rocky Mountain Division, Second and Fourth Subdivisions, built in 1889.  This was Northern Pacific's scenic transcontinental passenger train route used by the famous North Coast Limited and its Amtrak successor, the North Coast Hiawatha, which was discontinued in 1979. The line over the pass is currently owned by BNSF Railway. It has been inactive since 1983, as its grades and curvature are poorly suited to freight trains, which (now operated by Montana Rail Link) utilize the former Northern Pacific's easier route via Helena. It is unlikely that the rail line over the pass will ever be used again, but BNSF has resisted tearing out the line because the original lease with the Northern Pacific and the US Forest Service requires that the grade be returned to its original status, a very costly process.\n When Interstate 90 was built, the state of Montana used Homestake Pass to cross the Continental Divide, thereby providing an easier alternative to the US Route 10 route over the Divide at Pipestone Pass.\n A trail running race currently takes place annually on the Continental Divide Trail between Homestake Pass and Pipestone Pass. Hosted by Butte's Piss and Moan Running Club, the Wulfman CDT 14k is held on the Saturday closest to the Summer solstice.",
  "/wiki/Beaverhead-Deerlodge_National_Forest": "The Beaverhead\u2013Deerlodge National Forest is the largest of the National Forests in Montana, United States. Covering 3.36\u00a0million acres (13,600\u00a0km2), the forest is broken into nine separate sections and stretches across eight counties in the southwestern area of the state. President Theodore Roosevelt named the two forests in 1908 and they were merged in 1996. Forest headquarters are located in Dillon, Montana. In Roosevelt's original legislation, the Deerlodge National Forest was called the Big Hole Forest Reserve. He created this reserve because the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, based in Butte, Montana, had begun to clearcut the upper Big Hole River watershed. The subsequent erosion, exacerbated by smoke pollution from the Anaconda smelter, was devastating the region. Ranchers and conservationists alike complained to Roosevelt, who made several trips to the area.\n(Munday 2001)\n The greatest part of the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness is located in the larger Beaverhead National Forest portion of 2,130,671 acres (8,622.52\u00a0km2), which is 64% of the total area of the forest. The rest of this wilderness extends into the neighboring Deerlodge and Bitterroot National Forests. The Beaverhead section includes most of the Pioneer, Gravelly, and Sapphire Ranges. Both the Centennial and Bitterroot mountain ranges are also located here, with the Continental divide found in the Bitterroot range. Lemhi Pass, at an elevation 7,323 feet (2,300 m) above sea level, is a rounded saddle in the Beaverhead Mountains of the Bitterroot Range, along the Continental Divide, between Montana and Idaho. Here, in 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition first saw the headwaters of the Columbia River, which flow to the Pacific Ocean, and crossed what was then the western boundary of the United States. Lemhi Pass was the point at which the members of the expedition realized that there was not a waterway that would lead from east to west across the continent. Lemhi Pass was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The Lee Metcalf Wilderness, in the Madison mountain range, is a part of what is known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. However, most of the Lee Metcalf lies in neighboring Gallatin National Forest. The Beaverhead section lies, in descending order of land area, in parts of Beaverhead, Madison, Deer Lodge, and Silver Bow counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Dillon, Ennis, Wisdom, and Wise River.\n The smaller Deerlodge National Forest portion of 1,227,155 acres (4,966.12\u00a0km2), at 37% of the total area of the forest, encompasses much of the Tobacco Root Mountains and Flint Creek Range and parts of the Elkhorn Mountains; it straddles the Continental Divide in the Boulder and Highland Mountains. A number of ghost towns serve as reminders of the extensive mining history of the region. The Deerlodge portion of the forest,  located northwest of the Beaverhead portion, lies in sections of Granite, Jefferson, Silver Bow, Deer Lodge, Powell, and Madison counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Butte, Philipsburg, and Whitehall.\n Ponderosa pine, and various species of fir, spruce and juniper are the dominant tree species. Almost a third of the forest lands have no forest at all, and are instead rangeland with sagebrush, grass and the occasional cactus.  The forest is also home to the grizzly bear, Canadian lynx, bald eagle, bull trout, Arctic grayling, and the wolf, the latter being a migrant from northern Montana and from the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction program. Elk, mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep and pronghorn and black bear are more commonly found.\n The highest mountains in the forest top out at over 11,000 feet (3,400 m). The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and the Nez Perce National Historical Trail both pass through sections of the forest. In total, there are over 1,500 miles (2,400\u00a0km) of hiking trails, 50 campgrounds, dozens of lake and river boating access points and even 250 miles (400\u00a0km) of groomed snowmobile trails.\n Forest Service offices administering the National Forest are in Butte, Dillon (which is the headquarters location), Philipsburg, Deer Lodge, Whitehall, Boulder, Ennis, Sheridan, Wise River, Wisdom, and Lima. Interstate 15 and Interstate 90, Montana Highway 43 and Montana Highway 278, and the Pioneer Mountains Scenic Byway all provide access to forest service roads, trailheads and local communities near the forest.",
  "/wiki/Matt's_Place_Drive-In": "Matt's Place Drive-In in Butte, Montana is one of the first drive-in restaurants in Montana. Unlike later drive-ins, which frequently featured a streamline moderne style, or at least an acknowledgement of their orientation to automobile-oriented customers, Matt's Place was a straightforward conversion of a house to serve customers in cars.  Established in 1930, its chief concession to the automobile is a tall curb to keep parking cars from hitting the building and a menu on the outside of the building, advertising curb service.  The interior retains its 1936 counter and 1950s lighting fixtures.\n They were awarded the 2016 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award.",

Its western terminus is in Seattle, at State Route 519 near T-Mobile Park and CenturyLink Field, and its eastern terminus is in Boston, at Route 1A near Logan International Airport. \n The western portion of I-90 crosses the Continental Divide over Homestake Pass just east of Butte, Montana, connecting major cities such as Spokane, Washington; Billings, Montana; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Madison, Wisconsin. \n Between Seattle and the Wisconsin-Illinois state line, I-90 is an Interstate without tolls. East of that border, much of I-90 follows several toll roads, many of which predate the Interstate Highway system. These include the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, Chicago Skyway, Indiana Toll Road, Ohio Turnpike, New York State Thruway, and the Massachusetts Turnpike. The Interstate is not tolled through some segments in downtown Chicago; Greater Cleveland and the rest of Northeast Ohio; Erie and the rest of Northwestern Pennsylvania; and through brief sections near Buffalo and Albany.",
