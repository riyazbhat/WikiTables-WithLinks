  "/wiki/Royal_Albert_Dock,_Liverpool": "The Royal Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool, England. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick, it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood.

It was known simply as the Albert Dock until 2018, when it was granted a royal charter and had the honorific \"Royal\" added to its name.",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order (Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus, with the meaning of Etruscan order) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans, the other being the composite order. It is influenced by the Doric order, but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture, the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order (for example, the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders). Its classification as  a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance.",

  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture, tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window. The term probably derives from the 'tracing floors' on which the complex patterns of late Gothic windows were laid out. There are two main types, plate tracery and the later bar tracery. The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features, like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery. The earliest form of tracery, called plate tracery, began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab. Bar tracery was then implemented, having derived from the plate tracery. However instead of a slab, the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs. Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear (flowing) tracery.",

The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto (parare \"to cover/defend\" and petto \"breast\"). The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning. Where extending above a roof, a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface, or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall. Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack, but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires.\nIn the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",

  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture, the chancel is the space around the altar, including the choir and the sanctuary (sometimes called the presbytery), at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building. It may terminate in an apse.  It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship, while the congregation is in the nave. Direct access may be provided by a priest's door, usually on the south side of the church. This is one definition, sometimes called the \"strict\" one; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels, these are also often counted as part of the chancel, especially when discussing architecture. In smaller churches, where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir, the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area.

Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When Gothic flying buttresses were used, aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.",

The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault: effectively a series of arches placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of barrel roof.",
  "/wiki/Chapel": "A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small, and is distinguished from a church.  The term has several senses. Firstly, smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels; the Lady chapel is a common type of these.  Secondly, a chapel is a place of worship, sometimes non-denominational, that is part of a building or complex with some other main purpose, such as a school, college, hospital, palace or large aristocratic house, castle, barracks, prison, funeral home, cemetery, airport, or a military or commercial ship.  Thirdly, chapels are small places of worship, built as satellite sites by a church or monastery, for example in remote areas; these are often called a chapel of ease.  A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel.  Finally, for historical reasons, chapel is also often the term used for independent or nonconformist places of worship in Great Britain\u2014outside the established church, even where in practice they operate as a parish church.",

Although the tincture azure of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England. This coat, designed in the High Middle Ages, has been variously combined with those of the Kings of France, Scotland, a symbol of Ireland, the House of Nassau and  the Kingdom of Hanover, according to dynastic and other political changes occurring in England, but has not altered since it took a fixed form in the reign of Richard I (1189\u20131199), the second Plantagenet king.",

His business was the Merseyside Iron Foundry, which was located in Tithebarn Street, Liverpool.  Cragg was an enthusiast in the use of prefabricated ironwork in the structure of buildings, and in the early 19th\u00a0century became interested in building churches.  He had been discussing building a church in Toxteth Park, Liverpool, and in 1809 plans had been drawn up for this by J.\u00a0M.\u00a0Gandy.  This church was never built, but in 1812 Cragg met Thomas Rickman, and together they designed the three churches in Liverpool incorporating Cragg's cast iron elements.  The first of these was St George's Church, Everton (1813\u201314).  The exterior of this church is largely in stone, but the framework of its interior, including the galleries, and the window tracery are in cast iron.  The ceilings consist of slate slabs supported by cast iron rafters, which are decorated with cast iron tracery.  The second church resulting from this collaboration was St Michael's Church, Aigburth (1813\u201315),  Here, in addition to the cast iron framework of the interior, and the window tracery, the parapets, battlements, pinnacles, hoodmoulds, the dado, and other details are also in cast iron.  The area around the church, known as St Michael's Hamlet contains five villas containing many cast iron features.  The third cast iron church was St Philip's Church (1815\u201316) in Hardman Street, Liverpool, which was closed in 1882 and demolished.  Some cast iron fragments have been incorporated in the fabric of the block of buildings now occupying the site of the churchyard.  Cragg did not marry.
