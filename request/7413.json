  "/wiki/Baron_Carleton": "Baron Carleton is a title that has been created three times in British history, once in the Peerage of Ireland and twice in the Peerage of Great Britain. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1626 when Sir Dudley Carleton was made Baron Carleton, of Imbercourt in the County of Surrey. He was made Viscount Dorchester two years later. See the article on him for more information on this creation. Dudley Carleton was the first cousin of Sir John Carleton, 1st Baronet (see Carleton baronets).  \n The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1714 when Henry Boyle was made Baron Carleton, of Carleton in the County of York. He was the son of Charles Boyle, 3rd Viscount Dungarvan and the brother of Charles Boyle, 2nd Earl of Burlington (see Earl of Cork for earlier history of the family). The title became extinct upon his death in 1725. \n The third creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1786 when Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Shannon was made Baron Carleton, of Carleton in the County of York, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. Lord Shannon was the first cousin of the first holder of the 1714 creation (through his mother Lady Henrietta Boyle, sister of Charles Boyle, 3rd Viscount Dungarvan), as well as a third cousin on his father's side. The barony and earldom have remained united since. See Earl of Shannon for further history of the titles.",
  "/wiki/Baron_Cobham": "The title Baron Cobham has been created numerous times in the Peerage of England; often multiple creations have been extant simultaneously, especially in the fourteenth century. The earliest creation was in 1313 for Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham, lord of the manors of Cobham and of Cooling, both in the county of Kent. The de Cobham family died out in the male line in 1408, with the death of the 3rd Baron Cobham, but the title continued via a female line to the Brooke family (anciently \"de la Brook\" or \"At-Brook\"), which originated at the estate of \"la Brook\" near Ilchester in Somerset, and which later resided at Holditch in the parish of Thorncombe and at Weycroft in the parish of Axminster, both in Devon, both fortified manor houses. Following their inheritance the Brooke family resided at Cobham Hall and Cooling Castle in Kent. Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham was attainted in 1603, when the peerage became abeyant instead of becoming extinct. In 1916 the attainder was removed and the abeyance terminated in favor of the fifteenth baron. The twelfth to fourteenth barons never actually held the title. This creation became abeyant again in 1951.\n The second creation was in 1324, when Sir Ralph de Cobham was summoned to parliament as Baron Cobham. The history of this creation is unknown following the death of the 2nd baron in or after 1378. The third creation was in 1326, when Sir Stephen de Cobham was summoned to parliament, again as Baron Cobham. This Cobham came from Rundale, and was apparently of no relation to Sir Ralph. This creation became abeyant no later than 1429. The fourth creation was in 1342, when Reginald de Cobham was summoned to parliament. However, this creation became extinct on the death of the second baron in 1403.\n The fifth creation was in 1645, when John Brooke was created Baron Cobham, but this title became extinct upon his death in 1660. \n There was a final creation in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1714 for Richard Temple, who was created Viscount Cobham four years later, with which the barony has remained merged. He was grandson of Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet and his wife Christian, daughter of Sir John Leveson and his wife Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Sondes and his wife Margaret, daughter of the tenth Baron Cobham.",
  "/wiki/Viscount_Cobham": "Viscount Cobham is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was created in 1718. Owing to its special remainder, the title has passed through several families. Since 1889, it has been held by members of the Lyttelton family.\n From 1750 to 1784, the barony and viscountcy of Cobham were subsidiary titles of the earldom of Temple of Stowe, subsidiary titles of the Marquessate of Buckingham from 1784 to 1822 and of the Dukedom of Buckingham and Chandos from 1822 to 1889. Since the latter year the Cobham titles have been merged with the titles of Baron Lyttelton and Baron Westcote.",

In 1641 he was also created Baron Bruce (designated \"of Whorlton in the County of York\") in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was created Baron Bruce of Skelton, Viscount Bruce and Earl of Ailesbury in the Peerage of England in 1664.\n His grandson, the fourth Earl of Elgin, was the last male descendant of the first Lord Kinloss and had no male heirs of his own. He therefore chose as his heir his nephew the Hon. Thomas Brudenell, fourth son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan. In 1746 he was given the additional title of Baron Bruce (designated \"of Tottenham in the County of Wilts\") with remainder to the Hon. Thomas.

  "/wiki/Peerage_of_Scotland": "The Peerage of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: Moraireachd na h-Alba, Scots: Peerage o Scotland) is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707. Following that year's Treaty of Union, the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain, and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created.\n After the Union, the Peers of the ancient Parliament of Scotland elected 16 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords. The Peerage Act 1963 granted all Scottish Peers the right to sit in the House of Lords, but this automatic right was revoked, as for all hereditary peerages (except those of the incumbent Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain), when the House of Lords Act 1999 received royal assent. Had the Scottish people voted \"Yes\" in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the eligibility of Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords would have been reviewed.\n Unlike most peerages, many Scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring (thus an Italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of Newburgh), and in the case of daughters only, these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance (as is the case with ancient English baronies by writ of summons). Unlike other British peerage titles, Scots Law permits peerages to be inherited by or through a person who was not legitimate at birth, but was subsequently legitimised by their parents marrying later.\n The ranks of the Scottish Peerage are, in ascending order: Lord of Parliament, Viscount, Earl, Marquis and Duke. Scottish Viscounts differ from those of the other Peerages (of England, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom) by using the style of in their title, as in Viscount of Oxfuird. Though this is the theoretical form, most Viscounts drop the \"of\". The Viscount of Arbuthnott and to a lesser extent the Viscount of Oxfuird still use \"of.\" Scottish Peers were entitled to sit in the ancient Parliament of Scotland.\n Scottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament, and although considered noble, their titles are incorporeal hereditaments. At one time feudal barons did sit in parliament. However, they are considered minor barons and not peers because their titles can be hereditary, or bought and sold.\n In the following table of the Peerage of Scotland as it currently stands, each peer's highest ranking title in the other peerages (if any) are also listed.
