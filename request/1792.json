Critics who downplayed his chances of winning were proven wrong when California Chrome won by \u200b1\u00a03\u20444 lengths even though Espinoza eased him for the final 70 yards (64\u00a0m). In the Preakness, he fended off two strong challengers in the homestretch and won by \u200b1\u00a01\u20442 lengths. He then shipped to Belmont Park with hopes of winning the Triple Crown in the 2014 Belmont Stakes, but was stepped on by the horse next to him at the start, tearing some tissue from his right front heel. With no one aware of his injury until the race was over, he finished fourth in a dead heat. After healing and pasture rest, he ran in the 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic, finishing third, a neck behind the winner. California Chrome returned to his winning form in his first start on a turf course in the Hollywood Derby in late November. California Chrome won many accolades and awards in 2014: The California State Legislature unanimously passed a resolution recognizing his outstanding performance, and the city of Fresno proclaimed October 11, 2014, as \"California Chrome Day\".

He was bred and owned throughout his racing career by Ahmed Zayat of Zayat Stables, trained by Bob Baffert, and ridden in most of his races by Victor Espinoza. He now stands  at stud at Ashford Stud in Kentucky.\n After finishing fifth in his track debut as a two-year-old, American Pharoah won his next two races, the Grade I Del Mar Futurity and FrontRunner Stakes, each by several lengths. An injury kept him out of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but the strength of his two wins nonetheless resulted in his being voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse at the 2014 Eclipse Awards.   Before the 2015 season began, Zayat had sold breeding rights to the colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud. He retained control over the colt and his racing career, as well as an undisclosed dividend on stud fees.\n American Pharoah began his 2015 campaign with wins in the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby and went on to win the 2015 Kentucky Derby and 2015 Preakness Stakes.

He is the CEO of Zayat Stables, LLC, a Thoroughbred horse racing business which bred and owns the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. Joe Drape of The New York Times described Zayat as \"controversial\" and \"one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing.\"\n Zayat was born in Cairo, Egypt to a wealthy family, and grew up in an ethnically-diverse neighborhood where he learned to ride horses. At age 18, he moved  to the United States where he attended college and ultimately obtained a master's degree in business and public health from Boston University. After a brief career in commercial real estate in New York City, he returned to Egypt, and for about a decade ran the Al-Ahram Beverages Company, which he owned as part of an investment group. After the company was purchased by Heineken in 2002, Zayat stayed on a few more years but also began investing in racehorses and established Zayat Stables in 2005. Upon returning to the United States for good in 2007, he made his racing stables his full-time occupation, working with his son, Justin, to build the business.\n While generally successful with his race horses, Zayat's goal of winning the Kentucky Derby eluded him several times, including three second-place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.\n The Zayat family are Orthodox Jews.  Zayat lives in Teaneck, New Jersey with his wife, Joanne. They have four children: Ashley, Justin, Benjamin, and Emma.

The other two are Derrinstown Stud in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland  and the 3200 acre Shadwell Farm near Lexington, Kentucky.\n The Nunnery Stud is where the whole British breeding operation is controlled and currently standing there are Aqlaam, Nayef, Mawatheeq and Sakhee, as well as Green Desert, now pensioned. In the past Nashwan, Unfuwain and Haafhd also stood there. Beech House Stud is used as a base for Shadwell's private mares, both Thoroughbred and Arabian. The paddocks are also used to winter the private Arabian young stock before they are broken in at Snarehill. Elmswell Park Stud and Salsabil Stud are located deep in the Suffolk countryside. These operations together look after Sheikh Hamdan's private mares. It is here that the mares are cared for prior to foaling, and then once they have foaled they stay until they return to Ireland with their foals in the late summer. The quiet surroundings of Salsabil Stud are ideal for the mares and foals at this early stage of the foals' development. The Snarehill Stud is used as a base for breaking in the young Thoroughbreds. It is also used for rest and rehabilitation for horses in training. Finally there is Melton Paddocks which was originally the public stud before the building of the Nunnery Stud, but now it houses the Arabian stallions.\n The Shadwell Farm in Lexington, Kentucky was constructed in 1985. At the farm's stallion division, Nashwan Stud, currently stand Albertus Maximus, Daaher, Mohaymen and Tamarkuz.\n The stud currently stands Alhaarth, Arcano, Elnadim, Haatef, Intikhab and Tamayuz.\n This investment has translated to great success on the race track. He was the British flat racing Champion Owner in 1990, 1995, 2002, and 2005. He has enjoyed over 50 Group 1 wins in Europe in addition to big race success in America, Australia and Dubai. His leading horses have ranged from sprinting champions such as Dayjur and Hamas, champion milers like Lahib and Bahri to great middle distance runners such as Nashwan, Unfuwain, Haafhd, Nayef, Jazil and Invasor. This is in addition to racing several classic winning fillies who have gone on to be great broodmares. The most famous being Salsabil who topped winning the Epsom Oaks by beating the colts in the Irish Derby. Shadwell's most famous broodmare is Height of Fashion who was sold by Queen Elizabeth II to Sheikh Hamdan Al-Maktoum after setting a new course record in the Princess of Wales' Stakes. She was the dam of Nashwan, Nayef and Unfuwain. She is also the grand dam of Ghanaati through her daughter Sarayir.\n In England he currently has approximately 200 horses in training spread over a number of trainers including Michael Stoute, John Dunlop, John Gosden, William Haggas, Marcus Tregoning, Ed Dunlop and Mark Johnston. In the past he sent horses with great success to Dick Hern, Michael Jarvis, Barry Hills, Alec Stewart and Harry Thomson Jones. In Ireland he has sent his horses for many years to Kevin Prendergrast and Dermot Weld and likewise in France to Freddy Head. In the United States, Kiaran McLaughlin is a trainer for Sheikh Hamdan's stable.  David A. Hayes conditions horses for the sheikh in Australia. In the UAE American trainer Doug Watson is responsible for the sheikh's runners at the Dubai carnival.\n In England he currently has two retained jockeys in Paul Hanagan and Tadhg O'Shea. In the 1980s and 1990s Willie Carson won many big races for Shadwell most famously on Nashwan and Salsabil.\n In late 2005, his Shadwell Stable acquired the Argentina-bred and Uruguay-owned racehorse Invasor and brought him to race in the United States. Invasor won several major graded stakes races including the 2006 Breeders' Cup Classic and was voted the U.S. Horse of the Year and ranked No.1 in the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings. He won them the Dubai World Cup but was retired in June 2007 following a non-life-threatening training injury and now stands as a stallion at Shadwell Farm in Kentucky. Shadwell Stables won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Owner of 2007 thanks to the efforts of Invasor and leading filly Lahudood.",

  "/wiki/American_Horse_of_the_Year": "The American Award for Horse of the Year, one of the Eclipse Awards, is the highest honor given in American thoroughbred horse racing. Because Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States has no governing body to sanction the various awards, \"Horse of the Year\" is not an official national award.\n The Champion award is a designation give to a horse, irrespective of age, whose performance during the racing year was deemed the most outstanding. The list below is a Champion's history  compilation beginning with the year 1887 published by the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association's The Blood-Horse magazine (founded 1961), described by ESPN as \"the Thoroughbred industry's most-respected trade publication\".\n In 1936 a Horse of the Year award was created by a poll of the staff of The New York Morning Telegraph and its sister newspaper, the Daily Racing Form (DRF), a tabloid founded in 1894 that was focused on statistical information for bettors. At the same time a rival poll was organised by the Baltimore-based Turf and Sport Digest magazine. Formed in 1942 as an advocacy group, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) inaugurated a competing award in 1950, selecting its winners from votes by racing secretaries from member tracks across the United States. The three systems resulted in different opinions as to \"Horse of the Year\" Champions in 1949, 1952, 1957, 1965, and 1970. In 1971, the DRF and TRA made an agreement with the National Turf Writers Association to merge into one set of awards, called the Eclipse Awards."
