  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States, Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910. Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era. Within the Victorian era timeline, Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles. The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture, a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses, produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714. It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance (non-Gothic Revival) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right. Queen Anne, as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture, is broadly applied to architecture, furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some Queen Anne architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s.",

  "/wiki/Second_Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture (sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes. Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque. Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate, or when many French Baroque features are present (Second Empire). The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English Wollaton Hall, Italian Palazzo Pitti, the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, and the Russian Palace of Facets\u2014all deemed Renaissance\u2014illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.",

The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past. Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880\u20131910, a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States. From 1910\u20131930, the Colonial Revival movement was  ascendant, with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style. In the immediate post-war period (c. 1950s\u2013early 1960s), Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed, but in simplified form. In the present-day, many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles. While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture, Colonial Revival homes also draw, to a lesser extent, from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles. Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style, freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes.",
