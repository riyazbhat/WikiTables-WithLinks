  "/wiki/Joe_Darling": "Joseph Darling CBE (21 November 1870 \u2013 2 January 1946) was an Australian cricketer who played 34 Test matches as a specialist batsman between 1894 and 1905. As captain, he led Australia in a total of 21 Tests, winning seven and losing four. In Test cricket, he scored 1657\u00a0runs at an average of 28.56 per innings, including three centuries. Darling toured England four times with the Australian team\u2014in 1896, 1899, 1902 and 1905; the last three tours as captain. He was captain of the Australian cricket team in England in 1902, widely recognised as one of the best teams in Australian cricket history.\n He was a stocky, compact man and a strong driver of the ball, playing most of his cricket as an opening batsman. He was a patient batsman and was known for his solid defence, but he was able to score quickly when required. In Sydney in 1897\u201398, he scored 160 in 165\u00a0minutes, including 30 boundaries to assist his team in defeating the English. He was the first man to score 500\u00a0runs in a Test series and was also the first to score three centuries in a series. His captaincy was disciplinarian in nature but his teammates respected his broad cricket knowledge. Even tempered with a strong personality, he was a stickler for fair play on the field. His teammates gave him the nickname \"Paddy\" due to a supposed resemblance to the Australian boxer, Frank \"Paddy\" Slavin.\n His cricket career was interrupted several times due to his obligations as a farmer, first growing wheat in South Australia, and later as a wool-grower in Tasmania. He was a member of several bodies dedicated to agriculture in Tasmania, including the responsible authority for the Royal Hobart Show. He was a pioneer in activities such as rabbit eradication and pasture improvement. He entered politics in 1921, standing as an independent in the Tasmanian Legislative Council, where he was a forceful speaker. He retained his seat in the Tasmanian Parliament until his death following a gall bladder operation in 1946.",
  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team, often referred to as the skipper, is the appointed leader, having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players. As in other sports, the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills, and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team, as the captain often has a say in team selection. Before the game the captains toss for innings. During the match the captain decides the team's batting order, who will bowl each over, and where each fielder will be positioned. While the captain has the final say, decisions are often collaborative. A captain's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics, and shrewdness in the field, may contribute significantly to the team's success.\n Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff, as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making, the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports.",

He was not a stylish batsman but his strokeplay was effective, with a sound defence and temperament.  He bowled leg spin with a gentle action and while not a big turner of the ball, he relied on accuracy to dismiss opponents.  He made his Test debut in 1902 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and was selected to tour England later that year where he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.  That was the first of four tours of England.  He was involved in several altercations with cricket administrators and was one of the \"Big Six\" who boycotted the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England after a dispute with the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket.\n A talented Australian rules footballer, Armstrong briefly represented South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League before playing Test cricket.  For much of his cricket career he was employed as a pavilion clerk by the Melbourne Cricket Club, who allowed him time off to play cricket.  Following his retirement from Test and first-class cricket after the successful 1921 tour of England, Armstrong took a position as an agent for a scotch whisky distributor and wrote on cricket for the Sydney Evening News.",
  "/wiki/Leg_break": "A leg break is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is a delivery of a right-handed leg spin bowler.\n A leg break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an anti-clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and this is where it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.\n A leg spin bowler will bowl mostly leg breaks, varying them by adjusting the line and length, and amount of side spin versus topspin of the deliveries.\n Leg breaks are considered to be one of the more difficult spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play because the ball moves away from their body. This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. \n Alternatively, for a ball aimed outside the leg stump, the breaking may be so sharp that the ball goes behind a right-handed batsman and hits the stumps \u2013 the batsman is then said (informally) to be \"bowled around his legs\". The animation on this page illustrates such a delivery.\n A left-handed batsman has less difficulty facing leg spin bowling, because the ball moves in towards the batsman's body, meaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from a leg break. \n A ball bowled by a left-arm unorthodox spin bowler with a leg break action spins in the opposite direction, i.e. from left to right as the bowler sees it. Such a ball is not normally called a leg break but a left-arm unorthodox spinner or \"Chinaman\".",
  "/wiki/Fast_bowling": "Pace bowler (also referred to as fast bowling) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket, the other being spin bowling. Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers, quicks, or pacemen. They can also be referred to as a seam bowler, a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries. Strictly speaking, a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace, though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days.\n The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake. The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable, linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it. For deviation caused by the ball's stitching (the seam), the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman's body, or inwards towards them. Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way. To 'bowl swing' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air. Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation, body position at the point of release, asymmetric ball polishing, and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball. The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately. Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory, the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly, or at all. A typical fast delivery by a professional has a speed in the range of 137\u2013153\u00a0km/h (85\u201395\u00a0mph).",

  "/wiki/Bill_Howell_(cricketer)": "William Peter Howell (born 29 December 1869, Penrith, New South Wales. died 14 July 1940, Castlereagh, New South Wales) was an Australian cricketer who played in 18 Tests from 1898 to 1904.\n He made his Test debut, Australia v England at Adelaide in January 1898 playing in 18 Test matches until 1904.\n Howell's finest achievement was taking 10-28 against Surrey during Australia's 1899 tour of England.\n The Cricket oval at Penrith Stadium is named after Bill Howell.\n In January 1898, Bill Howell played in his first test match against England at Adelaide Oval and made two trips to England in 1899 and 1902, and to South Africa in 1902. In August that year Tom Dickson convened a meeting of local cricketers at the Commercial Hotel in Penrith and as a result the Nepean District Cricket Association was formed. Its competition trophy was the Lees Shield presented by Local Member Samuel Lees which was to become the property of the first club to win it three times. That honour went to the Castlereagh Club.\n Locally, in one match Howell took ten wickets for ten runs, and in another hit seven sixes from a seven ball over. While overseas in 1902, his parents, George and Hannah (Colless) Howell died within days of each other. They owned two farms valued at \u00a31,165. After his retirement from international cricket Bill Howell returned to one farm at Castlereagh, while his brother Athol took up the adjoining farm. In 1899, Bill married Neva, the daughter of James and Sarah Hunter of Emu Plains.\n In 1957, Howell Oval in Penrith was dedicated to the cricketing achievements of William Peter Howell.\n William Peter Howell was to become renowned as one of Australia's most eminent Test bowlers, despite having to play for most of his career in the same side as that bowling genius, Hugh Trumble.\nOn Australian wickets, the strongly-built farm lad with the biggest of handlebar moustaches used a skillful variation of flight and pace to deceive opposition batsmen into an act of self-destruction. In England, his ability to impart massive spin on the ball enabled him to beat the bat consistently with turn. The snap of Howell's strong fingers caused the ball to literally buzz in its flight towards the awaiting batsman - an appropriate result for a New South Wales beekeeper. Quicker than Trumble, his main weapon was a devastating off-break but Howell also used a quick-turning leg-break as a variation. Even on the hard turf of Australia he could turn the ball more than his colleagues. Howell claimed all 10 Surrey wickets for 28 in his first bowling stint in England in 1899.\n Howell also appreciated the value of the ball that whips straight on without turning and was of great value to a succession of Australian teams in England, except on a sticky wicket when his break was sometimes too big. When Joe Darling took his team to South Africa for the first time in 1902-03, Howell ensured success for Australia in a three-match Test series by taking 14 wickets at 12.42 in the two games he played.\n From a 1967 NT News newspaper article about that tour of South Africa:\n But the highlight of the Australian tour was the devastating off-spin bowling of Bill Howell.\nLeft out of the first match because he was thought to be out of form, Howell played in the next five and took 48 wickets at a cost of just over nine runs each.\nA farmer from Rooty Hill near Sydney and a man with huge hands, Howell was noted for the amount of work he got on the ball.\nIn South Africa Howell was almost unplayable. Deliveries turning viciously from outside the off-stump sometimes had the effect of making the shaken batsman turn his head first over one shoulder, then the other, wondering what had happened to the ball.",

In 1902, Hill was the first batsman to make 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year, a feat that would not be repeated for 45\u00a0years. His innings of 365 scored against New South Wales for South Australia in 1900\u201301 was a Sheffield Shield record for 27\u00a0years. The South Australian Cricket Association named a grandstand at the Adelaide Oval in his honour in 2003 and he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2005.\n A short and stocky left-handed batsman, Hill had a crouched, somewhat awkward stance. He gripped the bat low on the handle, playing with a strong bottom hand. His batting style was nonetheless attractive and effective and he was especially strong on the leg side and when cutting. Able to score quickly when required, he was also recognised for his patience and strong defence. Hill normally batted at No. 3 and, along with his contemporary Victor Trumper, he was a mainstay of the Australian batting line-up in the early years of the 20th century. Hill had a strong throwing arm and was an excellent outfielder. He was a popular team-mate and captain, respected for his directness, honesty and cheerfulness.\n He played his first first-class cricket match for South Australia while still a schoolboy, aged 16. By the time he was 19, he had been included in the Australian team touring England in 1896, where he made his Test match d\u00e9but. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground two years later, Hill scored 188; his maiden Test century and still the highest score in Ashes Tests by a player under 21. He was named one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1899, despite missing half the English season due to illness. In the 1901\u201302 season, Hill was dismissed in consecutive innings for 99, 98 and 97. In total he was dismissed between 90 and 99 five times in Test cricket. In 1903\u201304, Hill was at the centre of a riot at the Sydney Cricket Ground after he was adjudged run out in a Test match against England. With Roger Hartigan he still holds the Australian Test record partnership for the eighth wicket\u2014243, made against England at the Adelaide Oval in 1907\u201308.\n Hill had a strained relationship with Australian cricket authorities. He turned down an invitation to tour England in 1909 due to his unhappiness with the contract terms offered. Despite this, he was appointed Test captain in 1910\u201311 for the series against South Africa. His Test cricket career ended in controversy after he was involved in a brawl with cricket administrator and fellow Test selector Peter McAlister in 1912. He was one of the \"Big Six\", a group of leading Australian cricketers who boycotted the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England when the players were stripped of the right to appoint the tour manager. The boycott effectively ended his Test career.

Nicknamed Jonah, Jones was one of the best and fastest bowlers of his time, initially erratic but subsequently gaining control of line and length to good effect. Jones worked as a customs officer, and one of his claims to fame as a cricketer was that he was known as 'The man who bowled a ball through W. G. Grace's Beard' and was reputed to have broken Stanley Jackson's ribs.\n His action was controversial and complained about in both England (in 1896) and Australia. Umpire Jim Phillips was given the job of enforcing the laws against illegal actions which had once more crept into the game in the late 1890s. Jones was first no-balled in a match between South Australia and the visiting English side in 1897/98.

  "/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1902": "The Australian cricket team toured England during the 1902 English cricket season. The five-Test series between the two countries has been fondly remembered; in 1967 the cricket writer A. A. Thomson described the series as \"a rubber more exciting than any in history except the Australia v West Indies series in 1960\u201361\". Australia had won the previous three Test rubbers between the two countries, and now won their fourth successive series, by two matches to one with two draws. In the process they \"beat the records of all their predecessors in the country\" by losing only two of 39 matches during the tour, their defeats being against England in the Fifth Test and in the first of their two fixtures against Yorkshire. The remaining 37 matches gave 23 wins for Australia and 14 draws.\n Following the tour, three of the Australians \u2014 Victor Trumper, Warwick Armstrong and Jim Kelly \u2014 were named Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1903, with their captain Joe Darling already having been bestowed that honour in 1900. The Australians' leading batsman, Victor Trumper, made more first class runs than anyone in the season, and of batsman with more than 1,000 runs only Arthur Shrewsbury scored his at a higher average. His 2,570 runs was a new record for any Australian in England. Harry Altham wrote: \"From start to finish of the season, on every sort of wicket, against every sort of bowling, Trumper entranced the eye, inspired his side, demoralized his enemies, and made run-getting appear the easiest thing in the world.\""
