  "/wiki/List_of_Venom_titles": "The various iterations of Venom have appeared as a principal character in a number of limited series, one shots, and ongoing series published by Marvel Comics. With the first issue of the first limited series published at the end of 1992 (cover dated February 1993), the character appeared in a string of 17 limited series. These series did not overlap in publication (with the exception of Venom - Deathtrap: The Vault, which was a reprint of another book), each having more than a month between the end of one series and the start of the next. With the exception of one shot titles, this resulted in the character appearing as the focal character of a new issue each month through the end of Venom: The Finale, published in November 1997 (cover dated January 1998), composing the equivalent of a five-year ongoing series from 1992 to 1997, with other issues and series following that.",
