  "/wiki/Nuclear_weapons": "A nuclear weapon (also called an atom bomb, nuke, atomic bomb, nuclear warhead, A-bomb, or nuclear bomb) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\"atomic\") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84\u00a0TJ). The first thermonuclear (\"hydrogen\") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10\u00a0million tons of TNT (42\u00a0PJ). A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds (1,100\u00a0kg) can release energy equal to more than 1.2\u00a0million tons of TNT (5.0\u00a0PJ). A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation.
