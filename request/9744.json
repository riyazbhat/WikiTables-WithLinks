  "/wiki/Forward_(basketball)": "There are five position in basketball. These positions are employed by all organized/unorganized basketball teams. They are defined as the point guard (PG), the shooting guard\n(SG), the small forward (SF), the power forward (PF), and the center (C). The point guard is the de facto leader of the team on the court. This position requires substantial ball-handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play. The shooting guard, as the name implies, is often the best shooter. As well as being capable of shooting accurately from longer distances, this position tends to also be the best defender on the team. The small forward often has an aggressive approach to the basket when handling the ball. The small forward is also known to make cuts to the basket in efforts to get open for shots. The power forward and the center are usually called the front-court, often acting as their team's primary rebounders or shot blockers, or receiving passes to take inside shots. The center is typically the larger of the two.",

Clemons, a 6'3 point guard from Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago, won an Illinois state title in 1975 and was named a Parade Magazine All-American as senior in 1978.

He followed that with a better junior campaign, as he averaged 21.9 points and 7.8 assists per game and was named Midwestern City Conference co-Player of the Year with Oklahoma City's Rubin Jackson.

The team gained national publicity again in 2018, as a result of both their Cinderella Story-esque performance in the tournament, in which they upset numerous teams to reach the Final Four as an 11-seed, tying for the lowest seed ever to do so, and the cultural popularity of their team chaplain, the then-98-year old nun Sister Jean.",
  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football, a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer (association football). They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game. A point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills. Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team, or sometimes for themselves. Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates. This involves setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score, and controlling the tempo of the game. A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets. Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders. A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock, the score, the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams, etc.",

  "/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)": "The power forward (PF), also known as the four, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. Power forwards play a role similar to that of center. They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, one of which is rebounding. Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m). Earlier, these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play. Some power forwards, known as stretch fours, have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals. In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 (1.98 m) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 (2.08 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 (1.83 m) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 (1.91 m). Despite the averages, a variety of players fit tweener roles which finds them in the small forward or center position depending on matchups and coaching decisions. [citation needed] Some power forwards often play the center position and have the skills, but lack the height that is usually associated with that position.

  "/wiki/Center_(basketball)": "The center (C), also known as the five position, or the big man, is one of the five positions in a basketball game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the NBA, the center is usually 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) or taller and usually weighs 240 pounds (110 kg) or more. They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post. Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency. In the 1950s and 1960s, George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979-80 season, however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished.

Small forwards are typically shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers, but typically taller, larger and stronger than either of the guard positions. The small forward is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the five main basketball positions. In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6' 4 (1.93 m) to 6' 8 (2.03 m) without shoes while in the WNBA, small forwards are usually between 5' 10 (1.78 m) to 6' 1 (1.85 m). Small forwards are responsible for scoring points, defending and often as secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center, although a few have considerable passing responsibilities. Many small forwards in professional basketball are prolific scorers. The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely. Some players at the position are very accurate shooters, others prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players, and still others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots. In some cases, small forwards position on the baseline or as off-the-ball specialists. Small forwards who are defensive specialists are very versatile as they can often guard multiple positions using their size, speed, and strength.
