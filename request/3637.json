The series began in 1987 with T\u014djin Maky\u014d Den: Heracles no Eik\u014d, and three sequels were released until 1994 in addition to a portable spinoff game released in 1992. After Data East's bankruptcy in 2003, Paon Corporation acquired the rights to the series, and Nintendo released the latest installment in the series, Heracles no Eik\u014d: Tamashii no Sh\u014dmei for the Nintendo DS in 2008. None of the games had been released outside Japan until E3 2009, at which the latest game was announced by Nintendo simply as Glory of Heracles. The series is based in the world of Greek mythology, with the Greek hero Heracles as the title character of each game. However, Heracles only serves as the main character in the original game and the Game Boy spinoff, and plays a support role in all subsequent games. The 2018 game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate represented the series in the game's spirit mode, with Heracles from the original game and the player character for the DS game, named as the Glory of Heracles Hero, possible to unlock.",
