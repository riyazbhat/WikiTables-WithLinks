  "/wiki/Save_percentage": "Save percentage (often known by such symbols as SV%, SVS%, SVP, PCT) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic. In ice hockey and lacrosse, its a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops. It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal. Although the statistic is called save percentage, it is given as a decimal (in the same way as an on-base percentage in baseball). Thus, .933 means a goaltender saved 93.3 percent of all shots they faced. National Hockey League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .900, and National Lacrosse League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .750. In ice hockey internationally, a save percentage is expressed as a true percentage (e.g. 90%), not a decimal. Save percentage applies in an analogous way to goalkeepers in association football. Save percentage in baseball applies to relief pitchers, particularly closers. This is the quotient of the number of successful saves and the number of save opportunities.",

The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the New York metropolitan area, along with the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers, and their fan base resides primarily on Long Island. The team was founded in 1972 as part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league World Hockey Association (WHA) out of the newly built Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Uniondale, New York. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing fourteen straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships between 1980 and 1983, the seventh of eight dynasties recognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships. Following the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since 1987-88, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the 2016 playoffs.

Under McLaughlin, a hands-on owner who fired many coaches during his ownership, the club won two Stanley Cup titles. The club was then owned by the Norris family, who as owners of the Chicago Stadium were the club's landlord, and owned stakes in several of the NHL teams. At first, the Norris ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by long-time executive Bill Tobin, and the team languished in favor of the Norris-owned Detroit Red Wings. After the senior James E.
