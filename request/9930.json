  "/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona": "Tucson (/\u02c8tu\u02d0s\u0252n, tu\u02d0\u02c8s\u0252n/) is a city in and the county seat of Pima County, Arizona, United States, and is home to the University of Arizona. The 2010 United States Census put the population at 520,116, while the 2015 estimated population of the entire Tucson metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was 980,263. The Tucson MSA forms part of the larger Tucson-Nogales combined statistical area (CSA), with a total population of 1,010,025 as of the 2010 Census. Tucson is the second most-populated city in Arizona behind Phoenix, both of which anchor the Arizona Sun Corridor. The city is 108 miles (174\u00a0km) southeast of Phoenix and 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) north of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. Tucson is the 33rd largest city and the 58th largest metropolitan area in the United States (2014).\n Major incorporated suburbs of Tucson include Oro Valley and Marana northwest of the city, Sahuarita south of the city, and South Tucson in an enclave south of downtown. Communities in the vicinity of Tucson (some within or overlapping the city limits) include Casas Adobes, Catalina Foothills, Flowing Wells, Midvale Park, Tanque Verde, Tortolita, and Vail. Towns outside the Tucson metro area include Benson to the southeast, Catalina and Oracle to the north, and Green Valley to the south.\n Tucson was founded as a military fort by the Spanish when Hugo O'Conor authorized the construction of Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n. It was included in the state of Sonora after Mexico gained independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821. The United States acquired Tucson via treaty from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase on June 8, 1854. Tucson temporarily served as the western capital of the Confederate Arizona Territory during the American Civil War. Tucson was Arizona's largest city by population during the territorial period and early statehood, until it was surpassed by Phoenix between 1910 and 1920. Nevertheless, population growth remained strong during the late 20th century. In 2017, Tucson was the first American city to be designated a \"City of Gastronomy\" by UNESCO. \n The Spanish name of the city, Tucs\u00f3n [tuk\u02c8son], is derived from the O'odham Cuk \u1e62on [t\u0283\u028ak \u0282\u0254\u02d0n], meaning \"(at the) base of the black [hill]\", a reference to a basalt-covered hill now known as Sentinel Peak. Tucson is sometimes referred to as \"The Old Pueblo\".",

  "/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona": "Phoenix is the capital and most populous city in Arizona, with 1,660,272 people (as of 2018[update]). It is also the fifth most populous city in the United States, and the only state capital with a population of more than one million residents.\n Phoenix is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is part of the Salt River Valley. The metropolitan area is the 11th largest by population in the United States, with approximately 4.73\u00a0million people as of 2017[update]. Phoenix is the seat of Maricopa County and the largest city in the state at 517.9 square miles (1,341\u00a0km2), more than twice the size of Tucson and one of the largest cities in the United States.\n Phoenix was settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers and was incorporated as a city in 1881. It became the capital of Arizona Territory in 1889. It is in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and has a hot desert climate. Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community with the original settler's crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus, and hay. Cotton, cattle, citrus, climate, and copper were known locally as the \"Five C's\" anchoring Phoenix's economy. These remained the driving forces of the city until after World War II, when high-tech companies began to move into the valley and air conditioning made Phoenix's hot summers more bearable.\n The city averaged a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s. This growth rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007\u201309, and has rebounded slowly. Phoenix is the cultural center of the state of Arizona.",
