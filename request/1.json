  "/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush": "The Klondike Gold Rush[n 1] was a migration by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon, in north-western Canada, between 1896 and 1899. Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in artifacts, films, games, literature, and photographs.\n To reach the gold fields, most prospectors took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway, in Southeast Alaska. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River, and sail down to the Klondike. The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year's supply of food, in order to prevent starvation. In all, the Klondikers' equipment weighed close to a ton, which most carried themselves, in stages. Performing this task, and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate, meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.\n Mining was challenging, as the ore was distributed unevenly, and permafrost made\ndigging slow. Consequently, some miners chose to buy and sell claims, build up huge investments, and let others do the work. \n To accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang up along the routes. At their terminus, Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon Rivers. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house approximately 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated, and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. \n Despite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly, gambling and drinking in the saloons. The Native H\u00e4n people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush; they were forcibly moved into a reserve to make way for the stampeders, and many died.\n From 1898, the newspapers that had encouraged so many to travel to the Klondike lost interest in it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the Klondike Rush. The boom towns declined, and the population of Dawson City fell. \n Gold mining production in the Klondike peaked in 1903, after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then, the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.[n 2]",

It was in use from late April or early May until late November each season, and sometimes throughout winter. During its operational lifetime, it captured nine tons of gold.",
  "/wiki/Gold_dredge": "A gold dredge is a placer mining machine that extracts gold from sand, gravel, and dirt using water and mechanical methods.\n The original gold dredges were large, multi-story machines built in the first half of the 1900s.\n Small suction machines are currently marketed as \"gold dredges\" to individuals seeking gold: just offshore from the beach of Nome, Alaska, for instance.\n A large gold dredge uses a mechanical method to excavate material (sand, gravel, dirt, etc.) using steel \"buckets\" on a circular, continuous \"bucketline\" at the front end of the dredge.  The material is then sorted/sifted using water.  On large gold dredges, the buckets dump the material into a steel rotating cylinder (a specific type of trommel called \"the screen\") that is sloped downward toward a rubber belt (the stacker) that carries away oversize material (rocks) and dumps the rocks behind the dredge.  The cylinder has many holes in it to allow undersized material (including gold) to fall into a sluice box.  The material that is washed or sorted away is called tailings.  The rocks deposited behind the dredge (by the stacker) are called \"tailing piles.\"  The holes in the screen were intended to screen out rocks (e.g., 3/4 inch holes in the screen sent anything larger than 3/4 inch to the stacker).",
  "/wiki/Placer_mining": "Placer mining /\u02c8pl\u00e6s\u0259r/ is the mining of stream bed (alluvial) deposits for minerals. This may be done by open-pit (also called open-cast mining) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunnelling equipment.\n Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits (particularly gold) and gemstones, both of which are often found in alluvial deposits\u2014deposits of sand and gravel in modern or ancient stream beds, or occasionally glacial deposits. The metal or gemstones, having been moved by stream flow from an original source such as a vein, are typically only a minuscule portion of the total deposit. Since gems and heavy metals like gold are considerably denser than sand, they tend to accumulate at the base of placer deposits.\n Placer deposits can be as young as a few years old, such as the Canadian Queen Charlotte beach gold placer deposits, or billions of years old like the Elliott Lake uranium paleoplacer within the Huronian Supergroup in Canada.\n The containing material in an alluvial placer mine may be too loose to safely mine by tunnelling, though it is possible where the ground is permanently frozen. Where water under pressure is available, it may be used to mine, move, and separate the precious material from the deposit, a method known as hydraulic mining, hydraulic sluicing or hydraulicking.",
  "/wiki/Klondike,_Yukon": "The Klondike (/\u02c8kl\u0252nda\u026ak/) is a region of the Yukon territory in northwest Canada, east of the Alaskan border. It lies around the Klondike River, a small river that enters the Yukon River from the east at Dawson City.\n The Klondike is famed due to the Klondike Gold Rush, which started in 1897 and lasted until 1899. Gold has been mined continuously in that area except for a hiatus in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n The name \"Klondike\" evolved from the H\u00e4n word Tr'ond\u00ebk, which means \"hammerstone water\". Early gold seekers found it difficult to pronounce the First Nations word, so \"Klondike\" was the result of this poor pronunciation.",
  "/wiki/S.S._Keno": "The SS Keno is a preserved historic sternwheel paddle steamer and National Historic Site of Canada. The SS Keno is berthed in a dry dock on the waterfront of the Yukon River in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada.\n The vessel was constructed in 1922, in Whitehorse, by the British Yukon Navigation Company, a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company. For most of its career it transported silver, zinc and lead ore down the Stewart River from mines in the Mayo district to the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart rivers at Stewart City. It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II.\n Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse, before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959. On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City. In doing so she became the last of the Yukon's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power. Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on the Yukon River and its tributaries during the latter half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries.",

The river's source is in British Columbia, Canada, from which it flows through the Canadian Yukon Territory (itself named after the river). The lower half of the river lies in the U.S. state of Alaska. The river is 3,190 kilometres (1,980\u00a0mi) long and empties into the Bering Sea at the Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta. The average flow is 6,430 m3/s (227,000\u00a0ft3/s). The total drainage area is 832,700\u00a0km2 (321,500\u00a0mi2), of which 323,800\u00a0km2 (126,300\u00a0mi2) is in Canada. The total area is more than 25% larger than Texas or Alberta.\n The longest river in Alaska and Yukon, it was one of the principal means of transportation during the 1896\u20131903 Klondike Gold Rush. A portion of the river in Yukon\u2014\"The Thirty Mile\" section, from Lake Laberge to the Teslin River\u2014is a national heritage river and a unit of Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Paddle-wheel riverboats continued to ply the river until the 1950s, when the Klondike Highway was completed. After the purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867, the Alaska Commercial Company acquired the assets of the Russian-American Company and constructed several posts at various locations on the Yukon River.\n The Yukon River has had a history of pollution from military installations, dumps, wastewater, and other sources.[citation needed] However, the Environmental Protection Agency does not list the Yukon River among its impaired watersheds, and water quality data from the U.S. Geological Survey shows relatively good levels of turbidity, metals, and dissolved oxygen.  The Yukon and Mackenzie rivers have much higher suspended sediment concentrations than the great Siberian Arctic rivers.\n The Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council, a cooperative effort of 70 First Nations and tribes in Alaska and Canada, has the goal of making the river and its tributaries safe to drink from again by supplementing and scrutinizing government data.",
  "/wiki/S.S._Klondike": "SS Klondike was the name of two sternwheelers, the second now a national historic site located in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada. They ran freight between Whitehorse and Dawson City along the Yukon River, the first from 1929-1936 and the second, an almost exact replica of the first, from 1937-1950.\n Klondike I was built by the British Yukon Navigation Company (a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company)  in 1929 and had the distinction of having 50% more capacity than a regular sternwheeler, while still having the shallow draft and meeting the size requirements in order to travel down the Yukon River.  Klondike I had a cargo capacity of 270 metric tonnes without having to push a barge.\n Klondike I ran aground in June 1936 north of 'The Thirty Mile' section of the Yukon River (at 61\u00b040\u203217\u2033N 134\u00b052\u203222\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff61.67139\u00b0N 134.87278\u00b0W\ufeff / 61.67139; -134.87278\ufeff (The Thirty Mile)). The company salvaged the ship's boiler, engines and many fittings to build Klondike II the following year. The hull of the SS Klondike I can still be seen at low water by canoeists on the Yukon River.\n Klondike II carried freight until the early 1950s.  Due to the construction of a highway connecting Dawson City and Whitehorse, many Yukon River sternwheelers were decommissioned.  In an attempt to save Klondike II, she was converted into a cruise ship.  The venture shut down in 1955 due to lack of interest, and Klondike II was left on the ways in the Whitehorse shipyards.\n The ship was donated to Parks Canada and was gradually restored until 1966, when city authorities agreed to move the ship to its present location, at that time part of a squatters' area.  The task required three bulldozers, eight tons of Palmolive soap, a crew of twelve men, and three weeks to complete.  Greased log rollers eased the process.\n On 24 June 1967, the SS Klondike was designated a National Historic Site of Canada, and she is now open during the summer as a tourist attraction.",

Whitehorse's downtown and Riverdale areas occupy both shores of the Yukon River, which originates in British Columbia and meets the Bering Sea in Alaska. The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near Miles Canyon, before the river was dammed.\n Because of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife. At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.

The Gothic Revival was imported to Canada from Britain and the United States in the early 19th century, and rose to become the most popular style for major projects throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n The Gothic Revival period lasted longer and was more thoroughly embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States, only falling out of style in the 1930s. The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded. Throughout Canada many of the most prominent religious, civic, and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings. In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars, most notably Alan Gowans, embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation's signature styles and as an integral part of Canadian nationalism.

  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial. It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.\n The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887, although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years. It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin, writer John Ruskin, and designer William Morris.\n The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America. It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced.",

The Tr'ondek people used this site primarily in the summer, hunting moose in the flats across the Klondike and fishing for salmon during their migration up the Yukon.\n Tr'ochek lies on the upstream flat, an alluvial deposition of the Klondike River, at the river confluence. Dawson City is directly north of the site, just across the Klondike.\n The river flat has a mixture of poplar trees, alder and willow bushes, with open grassy meadows. The steep hillside behind the site is covered with vegetation typical of a northern exposure boreal forest - thick moss, spruce, and small birch groves. On the bench above the flat, mining activity has stripped away both vegetation and soil, leaving a fringe of the original spruce forest along the edge of the river bluffs.\n The gold rush was a period of great disruption for the Tr'ondek Hwech'in. Thousands of stampeders overwhelmed them at their summer camp. To avoid the worst excesses of this time, the Tr'ondek Hwech'in made arrangements, with the assistance of the Anglican Church and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to move a few kilometres downriver to a site known as Moosehide.\n After the Tr'ondek Han relocation to Moosehide (64\u00b005\u203240\u2033N 139\u00b026\u203212\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff64.09444\u00b0N 139.43667\u00b0W\ufeff / 64.09444; -139.43667), Tr'ochek was used by the non-native newcomers for a series of urban and industrial activities. Several bridges connected the site to Dawson City and until the 1910s, Klondike City, as the site became known, remained a fairly active part of the Dawson urban area. Later, as the newcomer population dwindled, the site was used for a time for market gardening. First Nation people began resettling the site in the 1950s.\n In the early 1990s mining activity on the site instigated a lawsuit by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in challenging Canada's right to issue mining claims on unsurrendered Indian lands.
