  "/wiki/50s_progression": "The '50s progression is a chord progression and turnaround used in Western popular music. The progression, represented in Roman numeral analysis, is: I-vi-IV-V. For example, in C major: C-Am-F-G. As the name implies, it was common in the 1950s and early 1960s and is particularly associated with doo-wop. It has also been called the Heart and Soul chords, the Stand by Me changes, the doo-wop progression:204 and the ice cream changes. The first song to use the sequence extensively might have been Blue Moon, written in 1933 by Richard Rodgers, and first released, with lyrics by Lorenz Hart, in 1934. [not verified in body]",

It is otherwise known as the minor descending tetrachord. Traceable back to the Renaissance, its effective sonorities made it one of the most popular progressions in classical music Play (help\u00b7info). Despite the name it is not a true cadence (i.e., occurring only once, when ending a phrase, section, or piece of music); it is most often used as an ostinato (repeating over and over again). It is heard in rock songs such as Runaway by Del Shannon.",

  "/wiki/Backdoor_progression": "In jazz and jazz harmony, the chord progression from iv7 to \u266dVII7 to I (the tonic or home key) has been nicknamed the backdoor progression or the backdoor ii-V, as described by jazz theorist and author Jerry Coker. This name derives from an assumption that the normal progression to the tonic, the ii-V-I turnaround (ii-V7 to I, see also authentic cadence) is, by inference, the front door, a metaphor suggesting that this is the main route to the tonic. The \u266dVII7 chord, a pivot chord borrowed from the parallel minor of the current tonic major key, is a dominant seventh. Therefore, it can resolve to I; it is commonly preceded by IV going to iv, then \u266dVII7, then I. In C major the dominant would be G7: (the notes GBDF), sharing two common tones with B\u266d7: (the notes B\u266dDFA\u266d). The notes A\u266d and F serve as upper leading-tones back to G and E (when the chord moves to the tonic, C major), respectively, rather than B\u266e and F serving as the lower and upper leading-tones to C and E in a conventional G7-C major (V7-I) cadence.",

Coltrane continued his explorations on the 1960 album Giant Steps and expanded on the substitution cycle in his compositions Giant Steps and Countdown, the latter of which is a reharmonized version of Eddie Vinson's Tune Up.

  "/wiki/Eight-bar_blues": "In music, an eight-bar blues is a typical blues chord progression, the second most common blues form, common to folk, rock, and jazz forms of the blues, taking eight 44 or 128 bars to the verse. Examples include Sitting on Top of the World and Key to the Highway, Trouble in Mind and Stagolee. Heartbreak Hotel, How Long Blues, Ain't Nobody's Business, Cherry Red, It Hurts Me Too, Worried Life Blues, and Get a Haircut are all eight-bar blues standards. [citation needed]\n One variant using this progression is to couple one eight-bar blues melody with a different eight-bar blues bridge to create a blues variant of the standard 32-bar song. Walking By Myself, I Want a Little Girl and (Romancing) In The Dark are examples of this form. [citation needed] See also blues ballad. Eight bar blues progressions have more variations than the more rigidly defined twelve bar format. The move to the IV chord usually happens at bar 3 (as opposed to 5 in twelve bar); however, the I chord moving to the V chord right away, in the second measure, is a characteristic of the eight-bar blues. In the following examples each box represents a 'bar' of music (the specific time signature is not relevant). The chord in the box is played for the full bar. If two chords are in the box they are each played for half a bar, etc. The chords are represented as scale degrees in Roman numeral analysis.",

It is a succession of chords whose roots descend in fifths from the second degree (supertonic) to the fifth degree (dominant), and finally to the tonic. In a major key, the supertonic triad (\u2171) is minor, and in a minor key it is diminished. The dominant is, in its normal form, a major triad and commonly a dominant seventh chord. With the addition of chord alterations, substitutions, and extensions, limitless variations exist on this simple formula. The \u2171-\u2164-I progression is a staple of virtually every type of [Western] popular music, including jazz, R&B, pop, rock, and country. Examples include Honeysuckle Rose (1928), which, features several bars in which the harmony goes back and forth between the II and V chords before finally resolving on the I chord, Satin Doll (1953), and If I Fell.",

Neither the date nor the circumstances of its composition are known (suggested dates range from 1680 to 1706), and the oldest surviving manuscript copy of the piece dates from the 19th century. Pachelbel's Canon, like his other works, although popular during his lifetime, went out of style, and remained in obscurity for centuries. A 1968 arrangement and recording of it by the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra gained popularity over the next decade, and in the 1970s the piece began to be recorded by many ensembles; by the early 1980s its presence as background music was deemed inescapable. From the 1970s to the late 2010s, elements of the piece, especially its chord progression, were used in a variety of pop songs. Since the 1980s, it has also been used frequently in weddings and funeral ceremonies in the Western world. The canon was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue. Both movements are in the key of D major. Although a true canon at the unison in three parts, it also has elements of a chaconne.",
