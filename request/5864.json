The Braves moved to San Diego, California after the 1977\u201378 season, and became known as the San Diego Clippers. For the 1984\u201385 NBA season, the Clippers moved north to Los Angeles and became known as the Los Angeles Clippers.\n On October 14, 1970, the Braves beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 107\u201392 in their first game. In the 1972 NBA Draft, the Braves selected Bob McAdoo, who later won such awards as Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player. During McAdoo's years (1972\u201376) with the franchise, the Braves reached the post-season three times and had a record of nine wins and 13 losses during that time.\n Overall, the Clippers have qualified for the post-season fourteen times; most recently in the 2018-19 season. They passed the first round of the playoffs five times (1975\u201376, 2005\u201306, 2011\u201312, 2013-14 and 2014-15). The Clippers have never won league or Conference titles. In their 45-year history they have never been to a Western Conference Finals, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history. They also have only eleven seasons with a winning percentage of .500 or better, and as a result, in their April 17, 2000 issue, the Sports Illustrated had three Clippers fans on the cover that stated \"The worst franchise in sports history\". However, with the additions of Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, they made steady progress as a title contender in recent years. They won their first division title in the 2012-13 season, their 43rd year in the league, and repeated the following year. Chris Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets for eight players and a 2018 draft pick, after the 2017 season.",

They were also the first defending champion to be eliminated in the first round since the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984.\n The Lakers' win was the first title for both O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, both considered future first-ballot Hall of Famers, and the first Lakers championship since the 1988 NBA Finals.

The Sixers play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Since 1996, the Sixers have played home games at Wells Fargo Center.\n In 1937, owner Daniel Biasone founded the franchise as the Syracuse Nationals, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs three times then joined the NBA in 1949, one of seven NBL teams to merge with the rival Basketball Association of America (BAA). The Nationals qualified for the playoffs in every season played in Syracuse, advancing to three Finals and Losing. For the 1963\u201364 season, the year following the departure of the Philadelphia Warriors for San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia as the 76ers.\n The franchise has played fifty-three seasons as the Philadelphia 76ers, with thirty-three playoff appearances and zero championships. The Sixers acquired Philadelphia-native Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 from the Warriors and defeated Chamberlain's former team in the 1967 Finals, but suffered a sharp fall from grace due to the loss of Chamberlain to retirement and Billy Cunningham to the ABA: in 1972\u201373 the team won only nine games, the fewest in an 82-game NBA season. Under coaches Gene Shue and Cunningham, and the on-court leadership of forward Julius Erving, the 76ers returned as a power quite rapidly, achieving winning records in all but one season from 1975\u201376 to 1990\u201391.

In 2000\u201301 the Iverson-led 76ers won fifty-six games and defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals to reach the 2001 Finals but lost to the Lakers four games to one in the best-of-seven series. The 76ers were a middle-of-the-road team on-court during the following dozen seasons, but by the early 2010s financial problems led incoming general manager Sam Hinkie to clean out any expensive players in order to save money and gain draft choices for the future. Lacking on-court talent, the 76ers set many records for ineptitude in the following three seasons, becoming the second NBA team after the 1995\u201396 to 1998\u201399 Grizzlies to suffer three consecutive seasons winning fewer than twenty games.

The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Kobe Bryant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year.\n For the 2nd time in 3 seasons and the first time since 2008, all Western Conference playoff teams had at least 50 wins. The 7 games separating 1\u20138 was tied for the smallest margin, also from 2008.\n Cleveland's 61 wins in the NBA was the smallest win total for best record since the Pacers won 61 in 2004. The Cavaliers' second round playoff exit (4\u20132 vs. Boston) was the earliest for the top seed since the Dallas Mavericks' first round loss to the Golden State Warriors in 2007.\n Many teams avenged previous losses by defeating teams who defeated them in recent years. The Spurs defeated the Mavericks, who beat them twice in the previous 4 seasons. The Cavaliers beat the Bulls for the first time since The Shot. The Suns defeated the Spurs, who won the previous 4 meetings in the last decade. The Lakers beat the Suns, who defeated them in the first round in 2006 and 2007. The Celtics defeated the Magic, who eliminated them in 2009. And in the finals, the Lakers beat the Celtics who defeated them in the 2008 NBA Finals.\n Game 5 of the Magic-Celtics series was the last game played at Amway Arena (formerly known as Orlando Arena and TD Waterhouse Centre). The Magic, who last year upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in 6 after they went 8-0 through the first two rounds, also went 8-0 through two playoff series, only to suffer the same fate as the Cavaliers last year, losing to Boston in 6. The Cavs loss led to the LeBron James decision to join the Miami Heat. This was the last playoff appearance for the Cavs until 2015 when James returned to Cleveland and, along with Kyrie Irving, faced again his common rivals the Celtics and Bulls.\n The Charlotte Bobcats made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, and the first in the Charlotte NBA team's history since 2002. However, they failed to win a single playoff game in a loss to the Magic in the first round.\n The Celtics-Cavaliers series marked the first time that each team lost a home playoff game by record margins: Boston lost Game 3 124-95; Cleveland lost Game 5 120-88.\n The Oklahoma City Thunder made their first playoff appearance since relocating from Seattle in 2008; the team's last appearance was as the Seattle SuperSonics in 2005. Games 3, 4 and 6 were the first playoff games played at Ford Center (the arena's former tenants, the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, didn't play a single playoff game in the building). They made the most of their debut playoff appearance, pushing the eventual champion Lakers to 6 games.\n The Mavericks would hold the dubious distinction of losing 3 first round series while holding the top 2 playoff seeds. They lost to the seventh-seeded San Antonio Spurs in 6. They have also lost a playoff series against the Seattle SuperSonics (1987, as the second seed) and the Golden State Warriors (2007, as the top seed).",

In their inaugural season, the Suns posted a win\u2013loss record of 16\u201366. They participated in the playoffs only once in their first seven seasons.\n In the 1975\u201376 season, a rookie Alvan Adams helped the team reach its first NBA Finals, which they lost to the Boston Celtics 4\u20132. Charles Barkley and Steve Nash won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award while playing for the Suns. Barkley led the Suns to the 1993 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Chicago Bulls. After signing with the Suns in 2004, Nash led the team to three straight division titles, but after reaching the Conference Finals in 2009\u201310 the Suns have subsequently experienced their worst period of on-court failure, missing the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons (the franchise's previous record playoff drought was five seasons, which happened after the team made the postseason in only their second year of existence during the 1969\u201370 campaign).\n Despite their failures in the 2010s, the Suns franchise has the NBA's fourth-best all-time winning percentage, winning 54 percent of its games, as of the end of the 2015\u201316 season.

The first owners purchased the disbanded Gems from Detroit, Michigan, then renamed and moved the team. It was in Minneapolis where the Lakers received their official title from Minnesota's nickname, Land of 10,000 Lakes. The Lakers won five championships before relocating to Los Angeles for the 1960\u201361 NBA season. The Lakers went on to lose all of their six appearances in the NBA Finals in the 1960s, despite the presence of Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. In 1972, the Lakers compiled a 33-game winning streak, the longest streak in U.S. professional team sports, and won their sixth title, under coach Bill Sharman. The Lakers' popularity soared in the 1980s when they won five additional championships during a nine-year span with the help of Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and coach Pat Riley, the franchise's all-time leader in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins. Two of those championships during that span were against their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics. With the help of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, the Lakers played in seven NBA Finals between 2000 and 2010, winning three of them consecutively from 2000 to 2002, losing the next two in 2004 and 2008, and winning in 2009 and 2010; the last three appearances were without O'Neal.\n The Lakers hold records for having (at the end of the 2014\u201315 NBA season) the most wins (3,125), the highest winning percentage (.620), the most NBA Finals appearances (31) of any NBA franchise, second-fewest non-playoff seasons with seven and are second NBA championships with 16, behind the Boston Celtics' 17. They have won 60+ regular season games 11 times, trailing only the Boston Celtics in this category.\n However, the team has struggled in recent years. They are currently suffering the longest playoff drought in franchise history, having failed to qualify for the postseason for the past six years, after having missed the playoff only five times prior in their entire existence up to 2013; this period is only the second time in the team's entire history that they have missed out on playoff contention in consecutive seasons.",

They became the fourth 8th-seeded team ever to advance to the Conference Semifinals after defeating the Spurs in 6, and the second since the first round expanded to a best-of-7 format in 2003. In addition, this marked the first time that no first-round series was pushed to a Game 7 since the current format was introduced. Also, the 2011 Playoffs was the first time since 2007 that only one series went to a Game 7.\n The Los Angeles Lakers, who went to the Finals the previous 3 years, were swept by the Mavericks in the second round. It was the first time that Lakers head coach Phil Jackson had been swept in a playoff series. It would be the first time since 1996 and only the second since 1990 in which the Lakers lost a Western Conference playoff series despite having home court advantage.\n Game 7 of the Grizzlies\u2013Thunder series ensured a 12th straight postseason with at least one Game 7 played.
