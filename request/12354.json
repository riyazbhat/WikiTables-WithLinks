  "/wiki/Richie_Ashburn": "Donald Richard Ashburn (March 19, 1927 - September 9, 1997), also known by the nicknames, Putt-Putt, The Tilden Flash, and Whitey (due to his light-blond hair), was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball. (Some sources give his full middle name as Richie.) He was born in Tilden, Nebraska. From his youth on a farm, he grew up to become a professional outfielder and veteran broadcaster for the Philadelphia Phillies and one of the most beloved sports figures in Philadelphia history. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995.",
  "/wiki/Outfielder": "An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball or softball, farthest from the batter. These defenders are the left fielder, the center fielder, and the right fielder. As an outfielder, their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances, if there is any runners on the bases. As an outfielder, they normally play behind the six players located in the field. By convention, each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered. The outfield positions are 7 (left field), 8 (center field) and 9 (right field). These numbers are shorthand designations useful in baseball scorekeeping and are not necessarily the same as the squad numbers worn on player uniforms. Outfielders named to the MLB All-Century Team are Hank Aaron, Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Pete Rose, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Ken Griffey Jr.",
  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball, the batting average (BA) is the number of hits divided by at bats. It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal: A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred. If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement. In this context, .001 is considered a point, such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter.",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball, a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball, with neither the benefit of a fielder's misplay (see error) nor another runner being put out on a fielder's choice. A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit. For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B. Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball. It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field, or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield. It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly, and be a speedy runner. It also often requires that the batter's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base, as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple. (The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple). The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields (often increasing the number of home runs); it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history, generally in the dead-ball era. A walk-off triple (one that ends a game) occurs very infrequently. For example, the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples, excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error.",
  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner. The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10. A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate. Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing.",
  "/wiki/Johnny_Blatnik": "John Louis Blatnik (March 10, 1921 - January 21, 2004) was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball who played from 1948 through 1950 for the Philadelphia Phillies (1948-1950) and St. Louis Cardinals (1950). Listed at 6 ft (1.8 m), 195 lb (88 kg), Blatnik batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Bridgeport, Ohio. Known as a line-drive hitter and a strong-armed outfielder, Blatnik was the regular left fielder for the 1948 Phillies. He appeared in a career-high 121 games while batting .260 with 41 extra-base hits that season, and he also led the National League outfielders with nine assists. However, injuries cut short his career, and Blatnik appeared in just 28 games over the next two years. He began the 1950 campaign with the eventual NL champion Phillies Whiz Kids, but was traded to the Cardinals for left-handed pitcher Ken Johnson on April 27 after only four games played with Philadelphia. He was sent to the minor leagues by the Cardinals after only seven more games and 23 plate appearances. In a three-season Major League career, Blatnik was .253 hitter, with 113 hits, six home runs and 46 RBI in 138 games, including 59 runs, 27 double, eight triples, three stolen bases, and a .317 on-base percentage. Blatnik died in Lansing, Ohio, at the age of 82 and was buried nearby in Holly Memorial Gardens.",

  "/wiki/At-bat": "In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is a batter's turn batting against a pitcher. An at bat is different from a plate appearance. A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during their turn at bat, but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below. While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics, including batting average and slugging percentage, a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season. A batter will not receive credit for an at bat if their plate appearance ends under the following circumstances:",
  "/wiki/Plate_appearance": "In baseball statistics, a player is credited with a plate appearance (denoted by PA) each time he completes a turn batting. Under Rule 5.04(c) of the Official Baseball Rules, a player completes a turn batting when he is put out or becomes a runner. This happens when he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base; or when he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base (by a base on balls, hit by pitch, catcher's interference, or obstruction); or when he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (see also left on base, fielder's choice, force play). A very similar statistic, at bats, counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances.",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball, second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are usually right-handed; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4. Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on, or moving towards the base to cover. On a batted ball to right field, the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay. Due to these requirements, second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game, but there are hitting stars as well.",
  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball, a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire, without the benefit of a fielder's misplay (see error) or another runner being put out on a fielder's choice. A double is a type of hit (the others being the single, triple and home run) and is sometimes called a two-bagger or two-base hit. For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B.",
  "/wiki/Runs_batted_in": "A run batted in (RBI), plural runs batted in (RBI or RBIs), is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored (except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play). For example, if the batter bats a base hit, then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run, and the batter gets credited with batting in that run. Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby (or ribbie), rib, and ribeye. The plural of RBI is generally RBIs, although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural, as it can also stand for runs batted in.",
  "/wiki/Hank_Borowy": "Henry Ludwig Hank Borowy (May 12, 1916 - August 23, 2004) was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1942 through 1951, Borowy played for the New York Yankees (1942-45), Chicago Cubs (1945-48), Philadelphia Phillies (1949-50), Pittsburgh Pirates (1950) and Detroit Tigers (1950-51). He batted and threw right-handed. Born in Bloomfield, New Jersey, Borowy graduated from Bloomfield High School and Fordham University. He pitched in six World Series games and posted a 108-82 record with 690 strikeouts and a 3.50 earned run average (ERA) in 1,717 innings. Borowy debuted on April 18, 1942 with the Yankees, finishing with a 15-4 record, 85 strikeouts and a 2.82 ERA. He started Game 4 of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and did not receive a decision. In 1943, Borowy went 14-9 with 107 strikeouts and a 2.82 ERA and won Game 3 of the World Series against St. Louis. Named an All-Star in 1944, he pitched three scoreless innings in the game, ending the season with a 17-12 record, 107 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA. In 1945 Borowy posted a 10-5 record with the Yankees in the first half of the season. The 1945 All Star game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions, but Borowy was selected a virtual All Star in an unofficial poll of managers conducted by the Associated Press. At the All-Star break he was placed on waivers by the Yankees, and eventually sold to the Cubs for $100,000 ($1,420,148 in current dollar terms).",
  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer. Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position.",
  "/wiki/Earned_run": "In baseball, an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team. Conversely, an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense. An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game. However, it is unearned in that it was, in a sense, given away by the defensive team. Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher's statistics. However, earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher's earned run average (ERA), the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine innings pitched (i.e., averaged over a regulation game). Thus, in effect, the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs, while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team. To determine whether a run is earned, the official scorer must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls.",
  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings, \u200b72 2\u20443 innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively. Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched. It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched. Alternatively, it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs. He'll throw one pitch which will result in a triple play, and for that one pitch he'll be credited with a full inning pitched.",
  "/wiki/Jack_Brittin": "John Albert Jack Brittin (March 4, 1924 - January 5, 1994) was an American professional baseball player. The right-handed pitcher appeared briefly for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball in 1950 and 1951. He was born in Athens, Illinois; he was listed as 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and 175 pounds (79 kg). Brittin served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of World War II and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His professional playing career extended from 1947 through 1954. In 1949, he won 21 gams for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class B Interstate League. He was recalled by the pennant-bound 1950 Phillies in September from Triple-A, and in his debut he pitched a scoreless inning in a marathon, 19-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Cincinnati was ahead, 5-2, when Brittin relieved Robin Roberts in the eighth. He retired the Reds in order, then was removed for a pinch hitter. The Phillies tied the game in the ninth, and then again in the 18th frame, and won it 8-7 in their half of the 19th. In six total games pitched in the big leagues, all in relief, Brittin had a 0-0 record with a 6.75 earned run average.

  "/wiki/Putsy_Caballero": "Ralph Joseph Putsy Caballero (November 5, 1927 - December 8, 2016) was an American professional baseball infielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) in parts of eight seasons, all for the Philadelphia Phillies, during the Whiz Kids era. He holds the record as the youngest person in MLB history to appear at third base. After graduating from Jesuit High School in New Orleans at age 16, the Phillies signed Caballero to a contract worth $10,000. Following a few short stints at the major league level and playing parts of three seasons in the minor leagues, Caballero was named the Phillies starter at third base in 1948. In his only season as an everyday player, Caballero batted .245 in 380 plate appearances at age 20. After another stint in the minors in 1949, he was a backup infielder, pinch hitter, and pinch runner for the 1950 Phillies, and continued in that role through 1952. Following three more years in the minors, Caballero retired from baseball after the 1955 season. After his baseball career ended, Caballero worked as an exterminator.

  "/wiki/Relief_pitcher": "In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury, ineffectiveness, fatigue, ejection, or for other strategic reasons, such as inclement weather delays or pinch hitter substitutions. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, setup men, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched. A team's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team's bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game.",

He was born in Birmingham, Alabama. In a six-season career, Church posted a 36-37 record with 274 strikeouts and a 3.37 ERA in 999\u200b2\u20443 innings pitched. During his rookie season, Church was playing a key role for the famed 1950 Whiz Kids Phillies in their fight for a pennant. He was an important member of a very young pitching staff, teaming with Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons, Bob Miller, and the dependable reliever Jim Konstanty. However, Church was struck in the face by a line drive off the bat of Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski. The ball was hit so hard that it caromed into right field on the fly. A week later, he was out on the mound again to face the hard-hitting Dodgers, but after the game his season was over, and he did not play in the 1950 World Series. He finished 1950 at 8-6 with an ERA of 2.73 and two shutouts in 142 innings. Church enjoyed his most productive season in 1951, when he collected career-highs in victories (15), strikeouts (104), shutouts (4) and innings (246), including a one-hitter over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Early in the 1952 season, he was traded to the Reds. Church was 5-9 for Cincinnati, and 7-8 for the Reds and the Chicago Cubs in 1953.",
  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy. A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three, four, or five days after pitching a game before pitching another. Therefore, most professional baseball teams have four, five or six starting pitchers on their rosters. These pitchers, and the sequence in which they pitch, is known as the rotation. In modern baseball, a five-man rotation is most common. In contrast, a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Occasionally, an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings, and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher.",

A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters, and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8. Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter, the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out. Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez, Reggie Jackson, and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out.",

A right-handed pitcher and lifelong resident of Olivia, Minnesota, Donnelly had an 18-year (1935-52) professional career and worked in 190 Major League games between 1944 and 1951 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Braves. He stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 166 pounds (75 kg). Donnelly spent nine seasons in minor league baseball; in 1941, he had 28 wins and 304 strikeouts for the Class C Springfield Cardinals of the Western Association. He was promoted to the Major Leagues and the St. Louis Cardinals as a 30-year-old rookie in 1944. In 27 games, four as a starting pitcher, Donnelly posted a career-best 2.12 earned run average, won two of three decisions, and collected four saves as the Redbirds won their third successive National League championship. Donnelly then turned in two outstanding performances in relief in the All-St. Louis 1944 World Series. In his first outing, in Game 1, he retired all six St. Louis Browns to face him, but the Browns held on for a 2-1 triumph. Then, in Game 2, Donnelly relieved starting pitcher Max Lanier in the eighth inning of a 2-2 tie. He worked four scoreless frames, allowing two hits and one base on balls while striking out seven, and was the winning pitcher when pinch hitter Ken O'Dea drove home the winning run in the bottom of the eleventh inning. The Cardinals went on to win the World Series over the Browns in six games. Donnelly was sent to the Phillies in 1946 and spent 4\u200b1\u20442 seasons with them, appearing in 113 games as both a starter and reliever.",
  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls, and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out. The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules, and further detail is given in 6.08(a). It is, however, considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play. The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out (e.g., hit by pitch (HBP), catcher's interference). Though a base on balls, catcher's interference, or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter (and possibly runners on base) being awarded a base, the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls, and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball. An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher's interference, the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced; the ball is live after a walk (see below for details). A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher. When the batter is walked, runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base. If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded, all preceding runners are forced to advance, including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run; when a run is forced on a walk, the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04. Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance. Therefore, a base on balls does not affect a player's batting average, but it can increase his on-base percentage. A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk, though the effect is mostly the same, with the batter receiving a free pass to first base.",

  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home\nsafely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run. There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field. A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter, because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat. When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself. Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run, with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter. Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and, as a result, prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying, Home run hitters drive Cadillacs, and singles hitters drive Fords (coined, circa 1948, by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller, by way of mentoring his young teammate, Ralph Kiner).",

In the 1950 World Series, a four-game New York Yankees sweep dominated by Yankee pitchers, Hamner batted .429 (6 for 14) with three extra-base hits. In March 1952, Hamner was named captain of the Phillies by manager Eddie Sawyer. An All-Star three years in a row, Hamner was the National League's starting shortstop in the 1952 All-Star Game, played on his home field, Shibe Park, in Philadelphia. The game was called off after five innings due to rain. On May 16, 1959, Hamner was traded to Cleveland, but he batted only .164 for the remainder of the campaign. He then became a manager in the minor league system of the Kansas City Athletics, reappearing briefly with the A's as a pitcher during the 1962 season (he had dabbled on the mound for the 1956-57 Phillies). But the change did not prolong Hamner's playing career.",
  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order. Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup. In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6. More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position, as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly. Like a second baseman, a shortstop must be agile, for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play. Also, like a third baseman, the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield, where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base.",

He played all or part of 13 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1937-42 and 1946-47) and Philadelphia Phillies (1947-52). Heintzelman, who was born in Peruque, Missouri, was originally signed by the Boston Braves in 1935, and was acquired by the Pirates the following year. Heintzelman lost three full seasons in the prime of his career, serving in the army in WWII. Heintzelman's best season statistically was in 1949 when he finished 9th in voting for the National League MVP for leading the league in shutouts (5) and having a 17-10 win-loss record, 33 games (32 started), 15 complete games, 250 innings pitched, 239 hits allowed, 96 runs allowed, 84 earned runs allowed, 19 home runs allowed, 93 walks allowed, 65 strikeouts, 1 hit batsmen, 2 wild pitches, 1,041 batters faced, a 3.02 ERA and a 1.328 WHIP.

  "/wiki/Ken_Johnson_(left-handed_pitcher)": "Kenneth Wandersee Johnson (January 14, 1923 - April 6, 2004), nicknamed Hook for his curveball, was an American professional baseball player, a pitcher who appeared in 74 games pitched in Major League Baseball for three different teams between the 1947 and 1952 seasons. Listed at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m), 185 pounds (84 kg), he batted and threw left-handed. The native of Topeka, Kansas, served in World War II in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations, where he was a tank commander. Johnson was a hard-throwing pitcher but what he lacked in control he made up for in the velocity and movement of his pitches. His wildness impeded his career, though he had flashes of brilliance. Johnson entered the Majors in 1947 with the St. Louis Cardinals, playing for them in part of four seasons (1947-50) before joining the Philadelphia Phillies (1950-51) and Detroit Tigers (1952). In his first major league start, he pitched a one-hitter for the Cardinals against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field (September 27). He struggled with his control after that and was sent by St. Louis to the Phillies in exchange for outfielder Johnny Blatnik. He went 4-1 as a member of the famous Phillies Whiz Kids, on the way to the National League pennant. Although he did not pitch in the 1950 World Series, Johnson appeared as a pinch runner for Dick Sisler in the ninth inning of Game 4, and scored the Phils' last run of the Fall Classic on an error by New York Yankees leftfielder Gene Woodling. New York won that game, 5-2, and the Series, four games to none. Johnson also pitched in nine games for Detroit in 1952, his last Major League season.",
  "/wiki/Willie_Jones_(baseball)": "Willie Edward Jones (August 16, 1925 - October 18, 1983), nicknamed Puddin' Head, was a Major League Baseball third baseman who played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1947-1959), Cleveland Indians (1959) and Cincinnati Reds (1959-1961). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 15-season career, Jones was a .258 hitter with 190 home runs and 812 RBI in 1691 games played. Born in Dillon, South Carolina, Jones grew up in and listed Laurel Hill, North Carolina, as his home. A World War II veteran of the United States Navy, Jones started his major league career with the Phillies in 1947. By 1949, he became the team's starting third baseman, and held that position until 1959. Jones was the top fielding third baseman in the National League during the 1950s. He led the league in fielding percentage five times, in putouts for seven years (also tying a record), and twice in assists and double plays. He was married and divorced to Carolyn, by whom he had three children, Eddie, Kathie, and Bradley. Jones' most productive season came as a member of the fabulous 1950 Whiz Kids National League champion team, when he posted career-highs in home runs (25), RBI (88), runs (100), hits (163), and led the league in games played (157). In 1951 he hit 22 homers with 81 RBI and a career-high .285 batting average. He was selected for the All-Star Game in both seasons.",
  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number '5'. The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, as he is often the closest infielder (roughly 90-120 feet) to the batter. The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base. The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play. The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory. Third base is known as the hot corner, because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction. A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour (201 km/h). Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected, creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply. As with middle infielders, right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base. Mike Squires, who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983, is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty. Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast.",

  "/wiki/Closer_(baseball)": "In baseball, a closing pitcher, more frequently referred to as a closer (abbreviated CL), is a relief pitcher who specializes in getting the final outs in a close game when his team is leading. The role is often assigned to a team's best reliever. Before the 1990s, pitchers in similar roles were referred to as a fireman, short reliever, and stopper. A small number of closers have won the Cy Young Award. Eight closers have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Mariano Rivera, Lee Smith, Bruce Sutter and Hoyt Wilhelm.",
  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball, a save (abbreviated SV or S) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances. Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead. The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers, particularly those in the closer role. The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969. The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date. Mariano Rivera is MLB's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652.",

A two-time all-star, he was the first National League catcher to wear glasses.",
  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket, but in cricket, wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities. Positioned behind home plate, the catcher can see the whole field, and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt. Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game's strategies, the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, including such prominent examples as Connie Mack, Steve O'Neill, Al L\u00f3pez, Mike Scioscia, and Joe Torre. The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season, and can have a negative effect on their offensive output. Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching, if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills, teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses.",

  "/wiki/Russ_Meyer_(baseball)": "Russell Charles Meyer (October 25, 1923 - November 16, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher known for his hot temper, his nickname was Mad Monk. His professional career lasted for 16 seasons, including 319 games pitched over all or part of 13 years in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs (1946-48; 1956), Philadelphia Phillies (1949-52), Brooklyn Dodgers (1953-55), Cincinnati Redlegs (1956), Boston Red Sox (1957) and Kansas City Athletics (1959). The native of Peru, Illinois, was listed as 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 175 pounds (79 kg). Initially signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent in 1942, Meyer spent 1943 performing United States Army service during World War II. While pitching for his camp team, Meyer was stricken with appendicitis, then contracted peritonitis; he was given a medical discharge and released by the White Sox organization. He signed with the crosstown Cubs, spent three seasons in the Class A1 (now Double-A) Southern Association, and made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 13, 1946. Among his ten full big-league seasons, two stand out. In 1949, as a Phillie, he won 17 of 25 decisions and posted a strong 3.08 earned run average, as Philadelphia finished in the National League's first division for only the second time since World War I. Then, in his maiden campaign for the Dodgers in 1953, he went 15-5, for a sparkling .750 winning percentage. However, his ERA was a poor 4.56 and he surrendered 25 home runs in 191\u200b1\u20443 innings pitched - testimony to the Dodgers' potent offense and the intimate dimensions of Ebbets Field, where Meyer's earned run average was 5.28. That season, Brooklyn won 105 games and its second consecutive National League pennant."
