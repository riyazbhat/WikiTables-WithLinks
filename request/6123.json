It is mentioned as the seat of a Byzantine strategos in the Escorial Taktikon (c.\u2009971/975). It was ceded along with other cities to David III of Tao in 979 for his assistance in suppressing the rebellion of Bardas Skleros, but recovered after David's death in 1000, when it became part of the catepanate of Iberia.\n The town is chiefly known from the report of John Skylitzes, who writes that it was a popular trade centre, attracting merchants from Syria and Armenia and elsewhere. The town was sacked by the Seljuk Turks in 1048/49, and its surviving inhabitants moved to Theodosiopolis, which they started to call in Armenian Arcn Rum (Artze of the Romans [i.e., Byzantines]).

In the late 10th century, the Bulgarian armies conquered the Serb principality of Duklja and led campaigns against the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary.

Isolated fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965, but the island was henceforth under Muslim rule until conquered in turn by the Normans in the 11th century. Although Sicily had been raided by the Muslims since the mid-7th century, these raids did not threaten Byzantine control over the island, which remained a largely peaceful backwater. The opportunity for the Aghlabid emirs of Ifriqiya came in 827, when the commander of the island's fleet, Euphemius, rose in revolt against the Byzantine Emperor Michael II. Defeated by loyalist forces and driven from the island, Euphemius sought the aid of the Aghlabids. The latter regarded this as an opportunity for expansion and for diverting the energies of their own fractious military establishment and alleviate the criticism of the Islamic scholars by championing jihad, and dispatched an army to aid him. Following the Arab landing on the island, Euphemius was quickly sidelined.

Although Byzantine authors use the term to describe the lands along the Danube in general, the province of Paristrion seems to have comprised mostly modern Dobruja. It is not certain exactly when the province was established: the Romanian scholar Nicolae B\u0103nescu considered that it was established immediately after the end of the Rus'\u2013Byzantine War of 970\u2013971, while others, such as Vasil Zlatarski, thought it a later, mid-11th century creation. It was governed by a katepano or a doux, and was probably based at Dorostolon (modern Silistra), where a Byzantine strategia (generalcy) is indeed attested in the 970s. In the aftermath of his victory over the Rus', Emperor John I Tzimiskes (r. 969\u2013976) appointed general Leo Sarakenopoulos as commander over north-eastern Bulgaria, based at Pereyaslavets/Ioannopolis. Sarakenopoulos and his subordinates engaged in major fortification activities in the region of the Dobruja over the next few years, where abandoned Roman-era forts were rebuilt and re-occupied. The region however fell back under Bulgarian control under the Cometopuli brothers in 986 and was held until c. 1001, when Byzantine control was re-established. B\u0103nescu, however, considered that Dorostolon at least remained in Byzantine hands throughout.",

  "/wiki/Theme_(Byzantine_district)": "The themes or th\u00e9mata (Greek: \u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, th\u00e9mata, singular: \u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1, th\u00e9ma) were the main military/administrative divisions of the middle Byzantine Empire. They were established in the mid-7th century in the aftermath of the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and Muslim conquests of parts of Byzantine territory, and replaced the earlier provincial system established by Diocletian and Constantine the Great. In their origin, the first themes were created from the areas of encampment of the field armies of the East Roman army, and their names corresponded to the military units that had existed in those areas. The theme system reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries, as older themes were split up and the conquest of territory resulted in the creation of new ones. The original theme system underwent significant changes in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the term remained in use as a provincial and financial circumscription until the very end of the Empire."
