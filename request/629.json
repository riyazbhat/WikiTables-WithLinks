As in most midterm elections,[citation needed] the party controlling the White House lost ground. Democrats did take five governorships from the Republicans, and Republicans took 11 governorships from the Democrats. An independent won one governorship previously held by a Republican. A Republican won one governorship previously held by an independent. Republicans held a majority of governorships for the first time since before the 2006 elections.

Most gains from both parties were made in races where no incumbent was running, either due to term limits or voluntary retirement, but three incumbent governors were defeated."
