  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada (French: Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada. The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history, holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's natural governing party. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), occupying the centre-left to left. Like their federal Conservative Party rivals, the party is often described as a big tent, attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre. The Liberals' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, legalizing same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and cannabis, national carbon pricing, and reproductive choice. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau had its best result since the 2000 election, winning 39.5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons. However, in the 2019 federal election, they lost their majority, winning 157 seats, but they still remained the largest party in the House.",
