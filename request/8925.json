The next two times Portugal qualified for the World Cup finals were in 1986 and 2002, going out in the first round both times. Portugal also made it to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 1984 final tournament, losing 3-2 after extra time to the hosts and eventual winners France. During this time, Portugal was not part of a group of teams that were candidates to win titles, but from 2000 until this present day, the team evolved, being present in all the final stages of major tournaments, due to the presence of several world-class players such as Lu\u00eds Figo, Rui Costa, Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who were dubbed as Portugal's golden generation, who were considered as the best of the world at their time and among the best in history. Portugal's golden generation helped Portugal reach the semi-finals of Euro 2000, losing 2-1 after extra time to eventual winners France, securing the second place at Euro 2004 Final after losing to Greece on home soil, as well reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup losing to finalist France, after a penalty, leading Portugal to secure the fourth place in the tournament, after losing to 3-1 to hosts Germany, thus being the best result since the 1966 World Cup. Despite losing many players of the golden generation, new players such as F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Nani and Pepe helped the Portuguese reach the semi-finals of Euro 2012, losing to Spain in penalties, with Cristiano Ronaldo finishing as joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals. In 2014, Fernando Santos was appointed as the new head coach for the national team. Two years later at Euro 2016, Santos brought Portugal its first ever major trophy, defeating hosts France 1-0 after extra time, with the winning goal scored by Eder. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its first appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place. Portugal hosted the brand new 2018-19 UEFA Nations League as well as winning the trophy, defeating the Netherlands 1-0, with the winning goal scored by Gon\u00e7alo Guedes, making it the second major tournament earned by the Portuguese in three finals.",
