  "/wiki/Kahurangi_National_Park": "Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand is the second largest of the thirteen national parks of New Zealand. It was gazetted in 1996 and covers 4,529 square kilometres (1,749 sq mi), ranging to near Golden Bay in the north. Much of what was the North-west Nelson Forest Park formed the basis of the new park. Kahurangi Point, regarded as the boundary between the West Coast and Tasman Regions, is located in the park, as are the Heaphy Track and Mount Owen. The park is administered by the Department of Conservation. Tramping, rafting and caving are popular activities in the park. After being prohibited for several years, mountainbiking was allowed on the Heaphy Track on a trial basis for the winters of 2011, 2012 and 2013. The effect of the cyclists on trampers and the wildlife were to determine whether the trial continued or not.",
  "/wiki/Blue_Lake_(Tasman)": "Rotomairewhenua / Blue Lake is a small lake in Nelson Lakes National Park, in the northern reaches of New Zealand's Southern Alps. Sacred to local M\u0101ori, it has the clearest natural fresh water in the world.",
  "/wiki/Nelson_Lakes_National_Park": "Nelson Lakes National Park is located in the South Island of New Zealand. It was formed in 1956 and covers some 1,019 square kilometres (393 sq mi). It is centered at two large lakes, Rotoiti and Rotoroa. The park also includes surrounding valleys (including Travers, Sabine, and D'Urville, upper reaches of the Matakitaki) and mountain ranges (Saint Arnaud Range, Mount Robert).

The park is administered by the Department of Conservation who operate a Visitors Centre in Saint Arnaud that provides up to date and reliable information on all aspects of the National Park.",
  "/wiki/Lake_Constance_(New_Zealand)": "Rotop\u014dhueroa / Lake Constance is an alpine lake in the South Island of New Zealand. It lies within the borders of the Nelson Lakes National Park. The lake is drained via an underground river into Rotomairewhenua / Blue Lake. In August 2014, the official name for Lake Constance was altered to Rotop\u014dhueroa / Lake Constance, following the Ng\u0101ti Apa ki te R\u0101 T\u014d Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Crown.",
  "/wiki/Abel_Tasman_National_Park": "Abel Tasman National Park is a New Zealand national park located between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay at the north end of the South Island. It is named after Abel Tasman, who in 1642 became the first European explorer to sight New Zealand and who anchored nearby in Golden Bay.",
  "/wiki/Torrent_River": "The Torrent River is a river of the Tasman Region of New Zealand's South Island. It flows east to reach Torrent Bay on the Tasman Bay coast of the Abel Tasman National Park. The Abel Tasman Track crosses the river close to its mouth.",
  "/wiki/Cobb_Reservoir": "The Cobb Reservoir, surrounded by Kahurangi National Park and fed by the Cobb River, is in the South Island of New Zealand. The reservoir feeds the Cobb Power Station and is 819 metres (2,687 ft) above sea level but drops significantly with low rainfall. Cobb Reservoir is the highest hydro storage lake in New Zealand. The dam that forms the reservoir was built from 1949 to 1954, replacing a smaller structure built about ten years earlier. It is an earth dam 32 metres (105 ft) high by 221 metres (725 ft) long. The geology of the area precluded the construction of a concrete dam. A narrow winding road leads over Cobb Ridge to Cobb Reservoir and along the lake's shore, providing access to tramping tracks in the area surrounding the valley. The road was built in the 1940s and remains unsealed from Cobb Power Station onwards.",
  "/wiki/Tasman_District": "Tasman District (M\u0101ori: Te Tai o Aorere) is a local government district in the north of the South Island of New Zealand. It borders the Canterbury Region, West Coast Region, Marlborough Region and Nelson City. It is administered by the Tasman District Council, a unitary authority, which sits at Richmond, with community boards serving outlying communities in Motueka and Golden Bay / Mohua. The city of Nelson has its own unitary authority separate from Tasman District, and together they comprise a single region in some contexts, but not for local government functions or resource management (planning) functions.",
  "/wiki/Lake_Rotoroa_(Tasman)": "Lake Rotoroa lies within the borders of Nelson Lakes National Park in the South Island, New Zealand. The lake is fed by the D'Urville and Sabine rivers. The greatest depth is 145 metres and the lake is completely surrounded by beech forest. Rotoroa is a small community at the base of the lake. The Gowan River flows out of the lake at this point, thus making the lake one of the sources of the Buller River system. A track follows the northeast side of the lake and a water taxi travels the length of the lake to ferry trampers to and from the tracks at the head of the lake. The lake has introduced trout, which attract recreational fishermen. [citation needed] There is a fly-fishing lodge, Lake Rotoroa Lodge, on the lake. The word rotoroa is M\u0101ori for long lake.",
  "/wiki/Lake_Rotoiti_(Tasman)": "Lake Rotoiti, previously also known as Lake Arthur, is a lake in the Tasman Region of New Zealand. It is a substantial mountain lake within the borders of Nelson Lakes National Park. The lake is fed by the Travers River, water from the lake flows into the Buller River. The lake is surrounded by Beech forest and is 82 metres deep. Saint Arnaud is a small community at the northern end of the lake. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of little lake for Rotoiti. The first European to see the lake was John Sylvanus Cotterell on 18 January 1843. Thomas Brunner and Charles Heaphy reached the lake in November 1843, and Heaphy named it Lake Arthur after Captain Arthur Wakefield, but the M\u0101ori name remained. For many years the lake formed part of John Kerr of Nelson's (Politician & landowner), beloved Lake Station - including Mt Robert. Kerr (who having introduced Trout to the lake),drowned there with many believing his son Robert to be responsible. The lake and Mt Robert reverted to the crown after mismanagement by Kerr's aforementioned son Robert in the years following his death. Tramping tracks circle the lake, including the Lakehead track on the east side and the Lakeside track on the west side.",
  "/wiki/Roaring_Lion_River": "The Roaring Lion River is a river of the Tasman Region of New Zealand's South Island.

  "/wiki/Whanganui_Inlet": "Whanganui Inlet is a large natural indentation in the northwest coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The inlet is a drowned river valley running parallel to the west coast. It is some 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) in length and on average is about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) wide. A narrow channel halfway along the valley connects the inlet to the Tasman Sea. This channel is located 19 kilometres (12 mi) southwest of Farewell Spit. It is still in a largely unspoilt natural state, with seagrass and salt march providing an environment friendly to sea life. It is a popular site for fishing and boating, and much of the inlet is protected by a wildlife management area and by the Westhaven Marine Reserve.",
  "/wiki/Cirque": "A cirque (French, from the Latin word circus) is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic coire, meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for valley, pronounced [k\u028am]). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion. The concave shape of a glacial cirque is open on the downhill side, while the cupped section is generally steep. Cliff-like slopes, down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge, form the three or more higher sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl-shaped as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and their accompanying rock burdens: hence it experiences somewhat greater erosion forces, and is most often overdeepened below the level of the cirque's low-side outlet (stage) and its down slope (backstage) valley. If the cirque is subject to seasonal melting, the floor of the cirque most often forms a tarn (small lake) behind a dam which marks the downstream limit of the glacial overdeepening: the dam itself can be composed of moraine, glacial till, or a lip of the underlying bedrock. The fluvial cirque or makhtesh, found in karst landscapes, is formed by intermittent river flow cutting through layers of limestone and chalk leaving sheer cliffs. A common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded."
