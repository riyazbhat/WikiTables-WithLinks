  "/wiki/Taoism": "Daoism (/\u02c8da\u028a\u026az\u0259m/, /\u02c8da\u028a-/), or Taoism (/\u02c8ta\u028a-/), is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasises living in harmony with the Dao (Chinese: \u9053; pinyin: D\u00e0o; literally: 'the Way', also romanized as Tao). The Dao is a fundamental idea in most  Chinese philosophical schools; in Daoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Daoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasising rigid rituals and social order, but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving perfection  by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called the way or dao. Daoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasise wu wei (action without intention), naturalness, simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: \u6148 compassion, \u5109 frugality, and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 humility. The roots of Daoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Daoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the I Ching (Yi Jing), which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The Legalist Shen Buhai (c. 400 \u2013 c. 337 BCE) may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei. The Dao De Jing, a compact book containing teachings attributed to  Laozi (\u8001\u5b50; L\u01ceoz\u01d0; Lao\u00b3 Tz\u016d\u00b3), is widely considered the keystone work of the Daoist tradition, together with the later writings of Zhuangzi.",
  "/wiki/Amulet": "An amulet, also known as a good luck charm, is an object believed to confer protection upon its possessor. The word amulet comes from the Latin word amuletum, which Pliny's Natural History describes as an object that protects a person from trouble. Anything can function as an amulet; items commonly so used include gems, statues, coins, drawings, plant parts, animal parts, and written words.\n Amulets which are said to derive their extraordinary properties and powers from magic or those which impart luck are typically part of folk religion or paganism, whereas amulets or sacred objects of formalised mainstream religion as in Christianity are believed to have no power of their own without being blessed by a clergyman, and they supposedly will also not provide any preternatural benefit to the bearer who does not have an appropriate disposition. Talismans and charms may differ from amulets by having alleged magical powers other than protection. Amulets are sometimes confused with pendants, small aesthetic objects that hang from necklaces. Any given pendant may indeed be an amulet but so may any other object that purportedly protects its holder from danger.",

The officials and nobles of the Mongol Empire issued paizas unofficially and abused civilians. Therefore, \u00d6gedei Khan (r. 1229\u20131241) prohibited the nobility from issuing paizas and jarliqs. To attract foreign or overseas merchants and talents, the Great Khans gave them paiza exempting them from taxes and allowing them to use relay stations.

These two scripts were used by the Khitan people in northern China during the 10th through 12th centuries for writing the extinct Khitan language. The Khitan language was in use during the Liao Dynasty (907\u20131125), the Kara-Khitan Khanate (1124\u20131218) and the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), but the last recorded Khitan speaker, Yel\u00fc Chucai, died in 1243, and the language probably became extinct soon afterwards. There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy, Sh\u016bsh\u01d0 hu\u00ecy\u00e0o (\u66f8\u53f2\u6703\u8981), written by Tao Zongyi (\u9676\u5b97\u5100) in the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan. The Khitan language is therefore little understood, and the two Khitan writing systems are only partially deciphered. The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility. Only one monument in a Khitan script was known before the 20th century, the Record of the Younger Brother of the Emperor of the Great Jin Dynasty (Langjun xingji \u90ce\u541b\u884c\u8a18), which has stood in front of the tomb of Empress Wu of Tang since at least 1618.
