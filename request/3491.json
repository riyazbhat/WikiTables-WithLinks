On its centenary in 2006, the theatre was \"twinned\" with His Majesty's Theatre in Perth, Western Australia.\n The granite-clad theatre is the brainchild of Robert Arthur, of Glasgow, who started his group of theatres in the 1880s focusing on Her Majesty`s Theatre, Dundee , and others in England. He took a lease of Her Majesty`s Opera House, Aberdeen  (later named the Tivoli) in Guild Street from 1891 and started to look for a site to build one according to his own specifications. His plans for Rosemount Viaduct were submitted to Aberdeen City Council in 1901, construction starting in 1904, and completed in 1906.\n Now with theatres in Scotland, and in England, such as the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, Robert Arthur floated his new company on the Stock Exchange in 1897. He staged the whole range of plays, opera, revues and pantomimes until the company ran out of funds in 1912. At this point Michael Simons of the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, chairman and founder of Howard & Wyndham Ltd, became chairman of the Robert Arthur group with the Arthur theatres now to be operated under the same directors and managers of Howard & Wyndham.\n Robert Arthur Theatres Ltd, through Michael Simons, sold the theatre in 1923 to Walter Gilbert, managing director of the Tivoli Theatre. On his death it was bought in 1932 by Councillor James F Donald,  of cinema and dance hall note. James Donald refurbished the venue and introduced features such as external neon lighting, a cinema projector and a revolving stage. Gilbert`s son and the Donald family managed it until 1939 when the ownership, programming and production passed to Howard & Wyndham Ltd (of which Peter Donald became a director) continuing until the late 1960s when Peter Donald and family bought it back.\nAberdeen City Council bought the theatre in 1975, the Council duly allocating \u00a33.5 million to ensure the building's survival.  After 23 months of closure the theatre was reopened in 1982 by Prince Charles.\n After a National Lottery grant was awarded in 1999, the theatre was the subject of a refurbishment and extension. The refurbishment and new glass-fronted box office, caf\u00e9 and restaurant was designed by esteemed Aberdeen City Council architect Trevor Smith, who also designed the award-winning Aberdeen Maritime Museum.
