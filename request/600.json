The series is set in the mid-late 1800s on the fictional Barkley Ranch in Stockton, California.  The one-hour episodes follow the lives of the Barkley family, one of the wealthiest and largest ranch owning families in Stockton, led by the matriarch Victoria Barkley (Barbara Stanwyck) and her sons Jerrod (Richard Long), Heath (Lee Majors), Nick (Peter Breck), and daughter Audra (Linda Evans). The series begins approximately 6 years after the death of the family patriarch, Thomas Barkley. Although he is never shown in the series (other than a painting), the character of Thomas Barkley is referred to as a major plot point many times.
