  "/wiki/Medical_evacuation": "Medical evacuation, often shortened to medevac or medivac, is the timely and efficient movement and en route care provided by medical personnel to wounded being evacuated from a battlefield, to injured patients being evacuated from the scene of an accident to receiving medical facilities, or to patients at a rural hospital requiring urgent care at a better-equipped facility using medically equipped ground vehicles (ambulances) or aircraft (air ambulances).\n Examples include civilian EMS vehicles, civilian aeromedical helicopter services, and military air ambulances. This term also covers the transfer of patients from the battlefield to a treatment facility or from one treatment facility to another by medical personnel, such as from a local hospital to a trauma center.",
  "/wiki/Air_ambulance": "Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transportation, aeroplane or helicopter, to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations aboard helicopter and propeller aircraft or jet aircraft.\n The use of air transport to provide medical evacuation on the battlefield dates to World War I, but its role was expanded dramatically during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Later on, aircraft began to be used for the civilian emergency medical services. Helicopters can bring specialist care to the scene and transport patients to specialist hospitals, especially for major trauma cases. Fixed-wing aircraft are used for long-distance transport.\n In some remote areas, air medical services deliver non-emergency healthcare such as general practitioner appointments. An example of this is the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, who also provide emergency care.",

The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo\u2013Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate used in Nunavut.\n Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec, Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador, and in various parts of the Northwest Territories, particularly around the Arctic Ocean, in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.[note 1] With the exception of NunatuKavut these areas are known in the Inuit languages as Inuit Nunangat. In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis.\n The Greenlandic Inuit are descendants of ancient indigenous migrations from Canada, as these people migrated to the east through the continent. Inuit of Denmark are Danish citizens, although not the citizens of the European Union. In the United States, the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat, live primarily on the Alaska North Slope and on Little Diomede Island.\n In Canada and the United States, the term \"Eskimo\" was commonly used to describe Inuit, and Siberia and Alaska's Yupik, I\u00f1upiat, and Chukchi people. However, \"Inuit\" is not accepted as a term for the Yupik and Chukchi, and \"Eskimo\" is the only term that applies to Yupik, Chukchi, I\u00f1upiat and Inuit. Since the late 20th century, Indigenous peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit consider \"Eskimo\" to be a pejorative term, and they more frequently identify as \"Inuit\" for an autonym.",

  "/wiki/Keewatin_Air": "Keewatin Air (IATA: FK) is an airline that operates from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The airline was started by Frank Robert May (who had been a pilot for Lamb Air) and his wife Judy Saxby in 1971, in the Keewatin Region, then part of the Northwest Territories.\n It was formed as \"Keewatin Air Limited\" to provide charter services to the region. It was the first airline to have a permanent base in Nunavut (then known as the Keewatin Region of the Northwest Territories). In 1987 it expanded to include medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) services, to what would become the Kivalliq Region, using a fleet of aircraft that began with a Tradewind aircraft - a multi-modified Beech 18 with a turbine engine and tricycle gear. This aircraft was followed by a Westwind, another modified Beech 18 with turbine engines and eventually these were replaced by Merlin IIA aircraft that had the added benefit of being pressurized and had turboprops. The MEDEVAC service is now known as \"Nunavut Lifeline\". Currently[when?] three Kingair 200 aircraft are based in Rankin Inlet, one in Churchill, Manitoba. and two in Iqaluit, where the airline also bases a Lear 35 for the long hauls to Ottawa and a Pilatus PC-12 to access the short strips.\n In 1998 the company formed Kivalliq Air to provide scheduled air service within the Kivalliq Region and to Winnipeg and Churchill.

  "/wiki/Helicopter": "A helicopter, or chopper, is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft cannot perform.\n The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re, coined by Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court in 1861, which originates from the Greek helix (\u1f15\u03bb\u03b9\u03be) \"helix, spiral, whirl, convolution\" and pteron (\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd) \"wing\". English language nicknames for helicopter include \"chopper\", \"copter\", \"helo\", \"heli\", and \"whirlybird\".\n Helicopters were developed and built during the first half-century of flight, with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936. Some helicopters reached limited production, but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production, with 131 aircraft built. Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration.  Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity.  Coaxial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and compound helicopters are all flying today.  Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones.",

It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since incorporating the province of Newfoundland in 1949.\n Nunavut comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Its vast territory makes it the fifth-largest country subdivision in the world, as well as North America's second-largest (after Greenland). The capital Iqaluit (formerly \"Frobisher Bay\"), on Baffin Island in the east, was chosen by the 1995 capital plebiscite. Other major communities include the regional centres of Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay.\n Nunavut also includes Ellesmere Island to the far north, as well as the eastern and southern portions of Victoria Island in the west, and all islands in Hudson, James and Ungava Bays, including Akimiski Island far to the southeast of the rest of the territory. It is Canada's only geo-political region that is not connected to the rest of North America by highway.\n Nunavut is the second-least populous of Canada's provinces and territories.

Before this event, Iqaluit was a small city and not well known outside the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensively imported supplies, as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road, rail, or even ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city has a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island; this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, although the city is well south of the Arctic Circle.\n As of the 2016 census, the population was 7,740 (Population Centre: 7,082), an increase of 15.5 percent from the 2011 census.
