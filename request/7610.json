  "/wiki/Jo\u00e3o_Pessoa,_Brazil": "Jo\u00e3o Pessoa (Brazilian Portuguese: [\u0292u\u02c8\u0250\u0303w pe\u02c8so.\u0250])[a] is the capital of the state of Para\u00edba in Brazil. Known as the Brazilian Paris, due its abundance of green area, it was founded in 1585 and it is also known as the city where the sun rises first, because it is the easternmost city in the Americas at 34\u00b0 47\u2032 38\u2033 W, 7\u00b0 9\u2032 28\u2033 S. Its easternmost point is known as Ponta do Seixas. The city is often referred as the second greenest in the world, with more than 7 square kilometres (2.7 sq mi) of forested land, second only to Paris, France, though such claim seems to be just a publicity stunt from the then mayor during Earth Summit. It is the state's largest city, with an estimated population of 800,323 of inhabitants (2018). Its metropolitan area comprises eight other satellite cities (Bayeux, Cabedelo, Conde, Lucena, Santa Rita, and others), totalling 1,223,000 of inhabitants. [citation needed]\n The new Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Ci\u00eancia, Cultura e Artes (Science, Culture and Art Station), located at the most eastern point of the Americas (Ponta das Seixas), is both an educational and cultural institution as well as a national landmark. The complex, inaugurated in 2008, was created by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and is one of his last projects. The capital of Para\u00edba received in 2017 the title of creative city by UNESCO, placing Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, as Brazilian city of handicrafts. Besides the capital of Para\u00edba, another city in Latin America, it has the same title, with the same category, which is Chordeleg, in Ecuador. The recognition of the capital Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, places it on the Brazilian tourist route for the richness of its popular art. This recognition had great contribution and influence, due to the mermaids project of Penha; where women artisans perform the manual work, dialoguing with the design, fashion, creative economy, highlighting the art with fish scales in copper wires.",
