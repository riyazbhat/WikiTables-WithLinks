Super Bowl XX was played on January 26, 1986 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. This was the fourth Super Bowl and, to date, the last time in which both teams made their Super Bowl debuts. The Bears entered the game after becoming the second team in NFL history to win 15 regular season games. With their then-revolutionary 46 defense, Chicago led the league in several defensive categories, outscored their opponents with a staggering margin of 456\u2013198, and recorded two postseason shutouts. The Patriots were considered a Cinderella team during the 1985 season, and posted an 11\u20135 regular season record, but entered the playoffs as a wild card because of tiebreakers. But defying the odds, New England posted three road playoff wins to advance to Super Bowl XX.",
