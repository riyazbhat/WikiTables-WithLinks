Before 18 April 2004, the chart week was from Sunday to Saturday, with the chart published on Sunday. Afterwards, the chart week was from Monday to Sunday, with the charts published on Monday. This meant there was a one-day charting period for 18 April 2004, with the next chart published on 19 April 2004. As a result, Usher spent three weeks and one day at number one with \"Yeah!\" instead of four complete weeks.\n A total of 171 singles topped the chart in the 2000s, including 23 by New Zealand artists. Twenty artists had three or more number-one singles; the most successful was Akon, whose seven number-ones totalled twenty-three weeks on top of the chart. Chris Brown, Eminem and The Black Eyed Peas each had five of their singles go to number one.\n Scribe's double A-side \"Stand Up\"/\"Not Many\" spent the longest at number one, with twelve weeks. This is the most weeks at number one ever by a New Zealander, and the second most for any song, after Boney M.'s \"Rivers of Babylon\" had fourteen weeks in the top spot in 1978. \"Axel F\", by Crazy Frog, and \"Brother\", by Smashproof and Gin Wigmore each had eleven weeks at the top spot. \"Brother\" broke the record for the longest consecutive number-one reign by a New Zealand artist, previously set by \"Sailing Away\" by All of Us in 1986.\n On 29 May 2006, \"Crazy\" by Gnarls Barkley replaced \"Hips Don't Lie\" by Shakira and Wyclef Jean at the top of the chart, and became the 500th number-one single in the RIANZ New Zealand Singles Chart's history.\n The source for this decade is the Recorded Music NZ chart, the chart history of which can be found on the Recorded Music NZ website or Charts.nz."
