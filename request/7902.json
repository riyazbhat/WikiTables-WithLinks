The quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes. When the QB is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, it is called a sack.",

The offensive tackle (OT, T) is a position on the offensive line, left and right. Like other offensive linemen, their job is to block: to physically keep defenders away from the offensive player who has the football and enable him to advance the football and eventually score a touchdown. The term \"tackle\" is a vestige of an earlier era of football in which the same players played both offense and defense.",

The Bruins compiled 367 points against their opponents in nine games, and allowed only 40 points.  The Bruins were not eligible to play in the Rose Bowl vs. Ohio State because of the \"no repeat\" rule in effect at the time.  No team was allowed to participate in consecutive Rose Bowl games, and since UCLA had played in the 1954 Rose Bowl, they were excluded from the 1955 event. The game likely would have made for a de facto national championship game, but thus, rival USC (whom the Bruins soundly defeated 34-0 during the season) competed in the Rose Bowl instead, losing to Ohio State.  Following the outcome, UCLA and Ohio State split the national championship.",
