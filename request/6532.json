  "/wiki/Composite_Index_of_National_Capability": "The Composite Index of National Capability (CINC) is a statistical measure of national power created by J. David Singer for the Correlates of War project in 1963.  It uses an average of percentages of world totals in six different components.  The components represent demographic, economic, and military strength. More recent studies tend to use the (CINC) score, which \u201cfocuses on measures that are more salient to the perception of true state power\u201d beyond GDP.  It is still \u201camong the best-known and most accepted methods for measuring national capabilities.\u201d The CINC only measures hard powers and may not represent soft powers or total national power.",
  "/wiki/Hard_power": "Hard power is the use of military and economic means to  influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power.  Hard power contrasts with soft power, which comes from diplomacy, culture and history.",
  "/wiki/Soft_power": "Soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (hard power). In other words, soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and lobbying through powerful political and non-political organizations, and through economic influence. In 2012, Joseph Nye of Harvard University explained that with soft power, \"the best propaganda is not propaganda\", further explaining that during the Information Age, \"credibility is the scarcest resource.\"",
