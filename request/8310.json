While he was well known at the time, most of his music has probably been lost.  All of his surviving music is secular, and all his compositions are chansons.",
  "/wiki/Jacobus_Vide": "Jacobus Vide (French: Jacques Vide; fl. 1405\u20131433) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the transitional period between the medieval period and early Renaissance.  He was an early member of the Burgundian School, during the reigns of John the Fearless and Philip the Good.\n The earliest mention of him is from the archives of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, in 1405, where he was probably a choirboy (some uncertainty exists with regard to the name).  In 1410 he held a position at the church of St Donatian in Bruges, and around the same time he may have been a singer in the chapel of Antipope John XXIII.  His service to the Burgundian court began sometime between then and 1423, when he was listed as a valet de chambre for Philip the Good, and in 1426 he was given charge of instructing and caring for two choirboys.  In 1428 he was promoted to the position of secretary to Philip the Good.  No records of his activity after 1433 have yet been discovered.\n All eight of his surviving works are rondeaux, secular French songs which were a favorite of the Burgundians.  They are somewhat unusual, in comparison to other music of the period, in their free use of dissonance, and in addition are marked by frequent use of cross-rhythms.  All of the characteristic cadences of the period \u2014 the Landini cadence, the Burgundian cadence, and the V-I cadence where the lowest voice jumps an octave to avoid parallel fifths \u2014 are common in Vide's music.\n One of his more enigmatic songs is a three-voice rondeau, \"Las, j'ay perdu mon espincel\", in which the upper voices, the superius and the tenor, are fully written out, but the contratenor is left blank.  Since the manuscript was carefully prepared, it is probable that the missing part was deliberate, and was a pun on the song text \"j'ay perdu mon\" (I lost my ...), in which case the singer, likely trained to improvise as well as sing from score, would have had to fill in by himself on the spot.",

  "/wiki/Johannes_Legrant": "Johannes Legrant (fl. c. 1420 \u2013 1440) was a French or Burgundian composer of the early Renaissance.\n Little is known for certain about his life, and as is common for composers of the early 15th century, there are problems of identification in the existing records.  In 1423 and 1424, he may have been a vicar at St. Vincent in Soignes, a collegiate church with an active music establishment.  Antwerp Cathedral's records mention a 'Heer Jan le Grant' as a singer there from 1441 to 1443, and this may also have been him.\n All of Legrant's surviving music is vocal.  His style is related to that of the early Burgundian School, and resembles some of the early work of Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois; influence may have gone either way.  He wrote elegant melodic lines in the Burgundian manner, and used the secular forms which were typical of the Burgundians:  the rondeau and the ballade.  Imitation is also prominent in his work.\n In addition to his secular music \u2013 four rondeaux and a ballade \u2013 four sacred pieces have survived, including two settings of the Gloria of the mass, for two and three voices, and a three voice Credo.\n It is not known if he is related to Guillaume Legrant, a slightly better-known contemporary of Johannes.

While often ranked behind his contemporaries Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstable by contemporary scholars, his works were still cited, borrowed and used as source material after his death.",
  "/wiki/Hugo_de_Lantins": "Hugo de Lantins (fl. 1420\u20131430) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the late Medieval era and early Renaissance.  He was active in Italy, especially Venice, and wrote both sacred and secular music; he may have been a relative of Arnold de Lantins, another composer active at the same time in the same area.\n Little is known about his life, except that he was probably in Venice during the 1420s, for he wrote ceremonial music for the Doge Francesco Foscari; his music appears in several collections from that city.  Evidently he wrote music for the wedding of Cleofe Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos, Prince of Sparta, in 1421, since precise topical details occur in the text to the music.  He almost certainly was known to Dufay, since both composers wrote music for some of the same events, and Dufay mentioned him in the text to one of the compositions he wrote during his stay in Rimini with the Malatesta family (1420-1424).\n Hugo's music is more forward looking than that of Arnold, making use of imitation, which was to become the prevailing musical device for the next hundred years and more; indeed, imitation is more prevalent in the music of Lantins than in the music of any other composer of the early 15th century.  Most of Hugo's music is for three voices, though occasionally he added a fourth.\n Several sections of masses have survived, but none complete, as well as five motets, one of which is isorhythmic.  In the secular music category he wrote many rondeaux, all in French, as well as some ballate in Italian (almost certainly for the royal wedding of the Malatesta family).",
  "/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins": "Arnold de Lantins (fl. 1420s \u2013 before 2 July 1432) was a Netherlandish composer of the late medieval and early Renaissance eras.  He is one of a few composers who shows aspects of both medieval and Renaissance style, and was a contemporary of Dufay during Dufay's sojourn in Italy.\n Very little is known about his life, except for a few years in the 1420s to around 1430.  It is presumed that he was from Flanders or adjacent areas.  In the early 1420s he was probably in the service of the Malatesta family in either Rimini or Pesaro, since Dufay mentioned him in the text of a rondeau which was written between 1420 and 1424.  Lantins was in Venice in 1428 and Rome in 1431, in the latter city as a singer in the papal chapel choir, along with Dufay.  He was only in Rome six months; after that he disappears from history.  Rome was entering a period of turmoil related to the Conciliar movement after the death, in February 1431, of Pope Martin V; many musicians left at that time or shortly after, and Lantins may have been one of them.\n It is not known for certain if Arnold de Lantins was a relative of Hugo de Lantins, a composer active at the same time, but since their works often appear together in collections and they seem to have been in the same geographical regions, it is not unlikely. However, a sharp stylistic difference between the works of the two composers shows they can not be the same person. Earlier theories that there was a third \"de Lantins,\" a certain Ray de Lantins, known from a single inscription in Munich, Bayerischestaatsbibliothek Mus. 3224, were shown to be wrong in 2012 by Margaret Bent and Robert Klugseder, upon the discovery of a second, fuller inscription to \"Raynaldus de lantins\" of a Credo ascribed to Arnold de Lantins in two other sources. This ascription makes it extremely likely that Ray should be read as a variant of Arnold.\n Lantin's music was held in high regard, and appears alongside that of Dufay, Gilles Binchois and Johannes Ciconia in contemporary manuscript collections.  In particular, one motet \u2013 Tota pulchra es \u2013 is found in widely distributed sources; since this was before the advent of printing technology, wide distribution of copies is taken as evidence of a composer's fame and popularity.  Arnold wrote a complete mass, found in Bologna Q15 (all the movements are found in OX 213 although the last two movements are separated \u2013 only the first three movements are found in Bologna 2216), as well as several parts of a composite mass in Bologna Q15, augmenting movements written by Johannes Ciconia. Several other examples exist of composers adding movements to partial masses written by other composers, for example Zacara da Teramo, particularly in Bologna Q15. Musically Arnold's mass movements are fairly simple, using three voices, head motif technique, and avoiding imitative writing.  Some of his other sacred music, such as his Marian motets, contain florid melodic writing and some use of imitation.\n He also wrote secular music, including ballades and rondeaux, all of which are in French, as well as a few shorter sacred pieces.  Some of them refer to specific events or specific people, but none of either have been conclusively identified.",
  "/wiki/Reginaldus_Libert": "Reginaldus Libert (Reginald; also Liebert) (fl. c. 1425\u20131435) was a French composer of the early Renaissance.  He was a minor member of the Burgundian School, a contemporary of Guillaume Dufay, and one of the first to use fauxbourdon in a mass setting.\n Little to nothing is known of his life.  He may be the same as a Reginaldus who was employed at the cathedral in Cambrai as a singing teacher to the boys in 1424.\n Four compositions by Libert have been identified.  Two are rondeaux, which was the popular type of French chanson at the time.  Both rondeaux are for three voices with only the uppermost voice being supplied with a text (instruments were often used for the other parts, especially in the music of the Burgundians).\n His most famous composition is a complete setting of the mass, for three voices, which contains some of the earliest use of fauxbourdon.  An unusual feature of this mass is that it contains music not only for the Ordinary (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei) but the Proper as well; in this regard it resembles the Missa Sancti Jacobi of Guillaume Dufay, which is often considered to be the earliest example of fauxbourdon to which the term was applied by the composer.  Libert's mass uses a plainsong source which permeates all the movements, and migrates from voice to voice.  Stylistically, this mass, as well as his other compositions, fit the period around 1430.\n Libert also wrote a setting of the Kyrie for four voices.  Both this Kyrie and the complete mass survive in the Trent Codices.",

  "/wiki/Adrien_Basin": "Adrien Basin (fl. 1457 \u2013 1476; died after 1498) was a Franco-Flemish composer, singer, and diplomat of the Burgundian School of the early Renaissance.  He was listed along with Antoine Busnois and Hayne van Ghizeghem as one of the personal singers to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.\n Little is known about his early life, and he first appears in the records as a singer to Isabella of Bourbon, who was the wife of Charles the Bold.  Later he seems to have joined the personal chapel of Charles, when Charles became Duke.  Unlike many of the musicians of the Burgundian court, who travelled along with Charles on his military exploits (who loved music as much as war, and enjoyed having musical entertainment during his military adventures), Basin seems to have remained in Bruges most of the time.  After the death of Charles at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, Basin served the court as a diplomat, according to records from the 1480s.  The last record of his life is dated to 1498, when he was named as heir to his brother Pierre.\n All of Basin's surviving music is secular, although some of the anonymous music in the manuscripts of the time may be by him.  Of his secular songs, one became immensely popular.  Nos amys vous vous abus\u00e9s was used by several later composers, including Tinctoris, as a source for mass settings, and numerous copies of the song have been found, some in collections as far away as Poland and Portugal.  Before the advent of music printing at the beginning of the 16th century, such distribution is rare, and generally shows the popularity of a piece.  This song, included in the Mellon Chansonnier, is the only one securely attributed to Adrien Basin:  his others, ascribed simply to 'Basin' in their sources, may have been written by his brother.\n Dates of composition of Basin's songs are not known, but probably they were written during the period when he was a singer for Charles.  If he wrote later music, either it has not survived, or has survived anonymously.",
  "/wiki/Hayne_van_Ghizeghem": "Hayne van Ghizeghem (c. 1445 \u2013 1476 to 1497) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the early Renaissance Burgundian School.\n While many of his works have survived, little is known about his life. He was probably born in Gijzegem (near Ghent, in modern Belgium).\nHis musical talent must have been noticed early by Charles, Count of Charolais (later to become Charles the Bold) because there is a record of his being personally assigned to a teacher by him; in 1467 he is shown in the Burgundian employment records as being a singer. In addition, he was named along with Adrien Basin and Antoine Busnois as \"chantre et valet de chambre\" to Charles, indicating the special regard in which he was held.\n In addition to serving as a singer and composer, he evidently served as a soldier as well, for there is a record of purchase of military equipment for him, prior to the campaign against Li\u00e8ge by Charles. Charles took his musicians along with him on his campaigns, because he loved music as much as war, and insisted on entertainment; however Hayne was the only one of his famous musicians known to be also outfitted as a soldier. He is known to have been at the Siege of Beauvais in 1472, where Charles was decisively repulsed by the French, and Hayne was long presumed by scholars to have been killed in that battle. However, recent research into his surviving compositions indicates that some may have been produced after 1472, especially because they seem to show stylistic development beyond the ones that can be definitively dated to 1472 or before. Current scholarship suggests he may have survived the siege, and gone to work at the court of France. That such a distinguished singer and composer worked for France's bitter rival would have been an offense easy to forgive, for Burgundian musicians of the time were highly prized.\n Hayne is principally known as a composer of chansons, and most of these are rondeaux. Two in particular\u2014Allez regrets, and De tous biens plaine\u2014were so famous in late 15th-century Europe that they appeared in 25 separate sources, many dating from before the invention of printing, and they were used as source material for many later compositions by other composers. Almost all of his works are for three voices; they are simple and clear in texture, in the typical manner of the Burgundian school; and the melodic voice is the highest.\n Eleven pieces can be definitively attributed to Hayne, though numerous similar works classified as \"anonymous\" may actually be compositions of his.
