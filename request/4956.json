Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major (\"greater\") and minor basilicas. Today only four, all in Rome, are classified as major basilicas:  the major basilicas of St John Lateran,  St Peter,  St Paul outside the Walls, and  St Mary Major. The other canonical basilicas, including all the basilicas in India are minor basilicas."
