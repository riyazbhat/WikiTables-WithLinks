  "/wiki/At-large": "At-large is a designation for members of a governing body who are elected or appointed to represent the whole membership of the body (notably, a city, county, state or province, nation, club or association), rather than a subset of that membership. At-large voting is in contrast to voting by electoral districts. If an at-large election is called to choose a single candidate, a single-winner voting system must necessarily be used. If a group of seats must be covered, many electoral systems can be possible, from proportional representation methods (such as party-list proportional representation, or PR-STV) to block voting.",
