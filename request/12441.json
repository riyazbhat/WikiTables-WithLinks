  "/wiki/Adenine": "Adenine /\u02c8\u00e6d\u026an\u026an/ (A, Ade) is a nucleobase (a purine derivative). It is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of DNA that are represented by the letters G\u2013C\u2013A\u2013T. The three others are guanine, cytosine and thymine. Its derivatives have a variety of roles in biochemistry including cellular respiration, in the form of both the energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). It also has functions in protein synthesis and as a chemical component of DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA. The adjacent image shows pure adenine, as an independent molecule. When connected into DNA, a covalent bond is formed between deoxyribose sugar and the bottom left nitrogen, so removing the hydrogen.",
  "/wiki/Adenylic_acid": "Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also known as 5'-adenylic acid, is a nucleotide. AMP consists of a phosphate group, the sugar ribose, and the nucleobase adenine; it is an ester of phosphoric acid and the nucleoside adenosine. As a substituent it takes the form of the prefix adenylyl-.\n AMP plays an important role in many cellular metabolic processes, being interconverted to ADP and/or ATP. AMP is also a component in the synthesis of RNA.",
  "/wiki/Carnitine": "Carnitine (\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b3-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid, 3-hydroxy-4-N,N,N-trimethylaminobutyrate) is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria. Carnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers d-carnitine and l-carnitine). Both are biologically active but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form. At room temperature, pure carnitine is a white powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with low toxicity. Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all organisms and animal tissue. Carnitine is the generic expression for a number of compounds that include l-carnitine, acetyl-l-carnitine, and propionyl-l-carnitine. It is most accumulated in cardiac and skeletal muscles as it accounts for 0.1% of its dry matter. It was first derived from meat extracts in 1905, therefore the name carnitine is derived from Latin \"caro/carnis\" or flesh.",
  "/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid": "Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them  for good health but cannot synthesize them.\n The term \"essential fatty acid\" refers to fatty acids required for biological processes but does not include the fats that only act as fuel. Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils, which are \"essential\" in the sense of being a concentrated essence.\n Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). Some other fatty acids are sometimes classified as \"conditionally essential\", meaning that they can become essential under some developmental or disease conditions; examples include docosahexaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and gamma-linolenic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).\n When the two EFAs were discovered in 1923, they were designated \"vitamin F\", but in 1929, research on rats showed that the two EFAs are better classified as fats rather than vitamins.",
  "/wiki/Riboflavin": "Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement. Food sources include eggs, green vegetables, milk and other dairy product, meat, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains. As a supplement it is used to prevent and treat riboflavin deficiency and prevent migraines. It may be given by mouth or injection. It is nearly always well tolerated. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. Riboflavin is in the vitamin B group.",
  "/wiki/B_vitamins": "B vitamins are a class of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. Though these vitamins share similar names, they are chemically distinct compounds that often coexist in the same foods. In general, dietary supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific number or name of each vitamin: B1 = thiamine, B2 = riboflavin, B3 = niacin, etc. Some are better known by name than number: niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin and folate.\n Each B vitamin is either a cofactor (generally a coenzyme) for key metabolic processes or is a precursor needed to make one.",
  "/wiki/Biotin": "Biotin, also called vitamin H (the H represents Haar und Haut, German words for \"hair and skin\"), vitamin B7 or vitamin B8 (in many countries like France, where vitamin B7 is used for Inositol) is a water-soluble B vitamin. It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the utilization of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids.\n Biotin deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning, brittle fingernails, or skin rash, typically on the face. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984, with many countries testing for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, obscuring the true prevalence of the disorder.",
  "/wiki/Catechol": "Catechol (/\u02c8k\u00e6t\u026at\u0283\u0252l/ or /\u02c8k\u00e6t\u026ak\u0252l/), also known as pyrocatechol or 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, is an organic compound with the molecular formula C6H4(OH)2. It is the ortho isomer of the three isomeric benzenediols. This colorless compound occurs naturally in trace amounts. It was first discovered by destructive distillation of the plant extract catechin. About 20,000 tonnes of catechol is now synthetically produced annually as a commodity organic chemical, mainly as a precursor to pesticides, flavors, and fragrances.\n Catechol occurs as feathery white crystals that are very rapidly soluble in water.",
  "/wiki/Flavin_group": "Flavin (from Latin flavus, \"yellow\") is the common name for a group of organic compounds based on pteridine, formed by the tricyclic heterocycle isoalloxazine. The biochemical source is the vitamin riboflavin. The flavin moiety is often attached with an adenosine diphosphate to form flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and, in other circumstances, is found as flavin mononucleotide (or FMN), a phosphorylated form of riboflavin. It is in one or the other of these forms that flavin is present as a prosthetic group in flavoproteins.\n The flavin group is capable of undergoing oxidation-reduction reactions, and can accept either one electron in a two-step process or two electrons at once. Reduction is made with the addition of hydrogen atoms to specific nitrogen atoms on the isoalloxazine ring system:",
  "/wiki/Anthranilic_acid": "Anthranilic acid  is an aromatic acid with the formula C6H4(NH2)(CO2H) and has a sweetish taste. The molecule consists of a benzene ring, ortho-substituted with a carboxylic acid and an amine. As a result of containing both acidic and basic functional groups, the compound is amphoteric. Anthranilic acid is a white solid when pure, although commercial samples may appear yellow.  The anion [C6H4(NH2)(CO2)]\u2212, obtained by the deprotonation of anthranilic acid, is called anthranilate.   Anthranilic acid was once thought to be a vitamin and was referred to as vitamin L1 in that context, but it is now known to be non-essential in human nutrition.",
  "/wiki/Adenylthiomethylpentose": "Adenylthiomethylpentose is a sulfur-containing nucleoside that was formerly known as vitamin L2. In 1912, an adenine nucleoside was isolated by Hunter et al. from yeast that were grown without phosphorus or sulfur. Later that substance was shown by Levene and Sobotkal to be adenylthiomethylpentose. In 1936, W. Nakahara et al. did experiments on rats that suggested that vitamin L2 deficiency inhibits the ability of rats to lactate. In 1942 they identified vitamin L2 to be adenylthiomethylpentose. Later studies by Folley et al refuted Nakahara's claims and demonstrated that L2 is not necessary for lactation and thus L2 is  not considered a vitamin today.",
  "/wiki/Folate": "Folate, also known as vitamin B9 and folacin, is one of the B vitamins. Manufactured folic acid, which is converted into folate by the body, is used as a dietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable during processing and storage. Folate is essential for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolise amino acids, which are required for cell division. As humans cannot make folate, it is required in the diet, making it an essential vitamin. It occurs naturally in many foods. The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S. is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements. Folate in the form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folate deficiency. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the baby.",
  "/wiki/Flavonoids": "Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word flavus, meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of polyphenolic plant and fungus secondary metabolites.\n Chemically, flavonoids have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton, which consists of two phenyl rings (A and B) and a heterocyclic ring (C). This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6. According to the IUPAC nomenclature,\nthey can be classified into:",
  "/wiki/Niacin": "Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid, is an organic compound and a form of vitamin B3, an essential human nutrient. It has the formula C6H5NO2 and belongs to the group of the pyridinecarboxylic acid. Niacin is obtained in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods, with highest contents in fortified packaged foods, tuna, salmon, some vegetable and other animal sources. Some countries require its addition to grains. Supplemental niacin is primarily used to treat high blood cholesterol and pellagra (niacin deficiency). Insufficient amounts of niacin can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. This lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency diseases, which are caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins (niacin, vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D, and vitamin A) and are usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition. Niacin supplementation has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin, but appears to be effective in those not taking a statin.",
  "/wiki/Salicylic_acid": "Salicylic acid (from Latin salix, willow tree) is a lipophilic monohydroxybenzoic acid, a type of phenolic acid, and a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). It has the formula C7H6O3. This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It is derived from the metabolism of salicin. In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products. The salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates.\n It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.",
  "/wiki/S-Methylmethionine": "S-Methylmethionine (SMM) is a derivative of methionine with the chemical formula (CH3)2S+CH2CH2CH(NH3+)CO2\u2212. This cation is an intermediate in many biosynthetic pathways owing to the sulfonium functional group.  The natural derivative S-methylmethionine is biosynthesized from L-methionine which is first converted to S-adenosylmethionine. The subsequent conversion, involving replacement of the adenosyl group by a methyl group is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine S-methyltransferase. S-methylmethionine is particularly abundant in plants, being more abundant than methionine.\nS-Methylmethionine is sometimes referred to as vitamin U, but it is not considered a true vitamin.  The term was coined in 1950 by Garnett Cheney for uncharacterized anti-ulcerogenic factors in raw cabbage juice that may help speed healing of peptic ulcers.",
  "/wiki/Vitamin": "A vitamin is an organic molecule (or related set of molecules) that is an essential micronutrient that an organism needs in small quantities for the proper functioning of its metabolism. Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism, either at all or not in sufficient quantities, and therefore must be obtained through the diet. Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others; it is not a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second. The term vitamin does not include the three other groups of essential nutrients: minerals, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids. Most vitamins are not single molecules, but groups of related molecules called vitamers. For example, vitamin E consists of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. The thirteen vitamins required by human metabolism are vitamin A (as all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinyl-esters, as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids), vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B7 (biotin), vitamin B9 (folic acid or folate), vitamin B12 (cobalamins), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D (calciferols), vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), and vitamin K (quinones). Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions."
