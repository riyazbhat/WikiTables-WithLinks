Their highlights in those years included the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon, and the \"Triple Crown Line\" of Charlie Simmer, Dave Taylor and Hall of Fame player Marcel Dionne, who had a famous upset of the uprising Edmonton Oilers in a 1982 playoff game known as the Miracle on Manchester. In 1988, the Kings traded with the Oilers to get their captain Wayne Gretzky, leading to a successful phase of the franchise that raised hockey's popularity in Los Angeles, and helped raise the sport's profile in the American Sun Belt region. Gretzky, fellow Hall of Famer Luc Robitaille and defenseman Rob Blake led the Kings to the franchise's sole division title in 1990\u201391, and the Kings' first Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1993.\n After the 1993 Finals, the Kings entered financial problems, with a bankruptcy in 1995, which led to the franchise being acquired by Philip Anschutz (owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group, operators of Staples Center) and Edward P. Roski. A period of mediocrity ensued, with the Kings only resurging as they broke a six-year playoff drought in the 2009\u201310 season, with a team that included goaltender Jonathan Quick, defenseman Drew Doughty, and forwards Dustin Brown, Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams. Under coach Darryl Sutter, who was hired early in the 2011\u201312 season, the Kings won two Stanley Cups in three years: 2012, over the New Jersey Devils, and 2014, against the New York Rangers while Quick and Williams respectively won the Conn Smythe Trophy.",
  "/wiki/Charles_Van_Horne": "Joseph Charles Van Horne (January 3, 1921 \u2013 August 27, 2003), also known as J.C. or Charlie, was a politician in New Brunswick, Canada, and the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick between 1966 and 1967.\n A lawyer and hotel owner in the Campbellton area, Van Horne ran for the federal Progressive Conservatives in the riding of Restigouche-Madawaska in a 1955 by-election following the death of Liberal Member of Parliament Joseph Boucher. Van Horne won the election, breaking a 22-year Liberal hold on the riding.\n While in Parliament, Van Horne successfully lobbied the federal and provincial governments to build a bridge between Campbellton and Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Qu\u00e9bec. The bridge opened in 1962 and is currently named for him.\n In 1966, after the resignation of Cy Sherwood, Van Horne successfully ran for leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party. His campaign against Liberal Premier Louis Robichaud in the 1967 provincial election is considered one of the most flamboyant and extravagant in New Brunswick history. Traversing the province in a Cadillac, wearing a cowboy hat, and with Don Messer providing entertainment at each stop, Van Horne frequently attacked Robichaud's mixed Acadian and First Nations heritage, saying \"these half-breeds shouldn't drink liquor\". Critics also accused Van Horne of being too vague on his promises. Robichaud was re-elected, and Van Horne resigned as leader. He attempted to regain the leadership at the 1969 party leadership convention but lost to Richard Hatfield.\n Van Horne remained in the Legislative Assembly and served as Minister of Tourism in the Cabinet of Richard Hatfield between 1970 and 1972 when he was fired from cabinet for going over budget. In 1975, he left politics entirely after pleading guilty to accepting a bribe over the purchase of park lands and receiving a two-year suspended sentence.",
