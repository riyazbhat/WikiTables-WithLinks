  "/wiki/Perfect_fifth": "In music theory, a perfect fifth is the musical interval corresponding to a pair of pitches with a frequency ratio of 3:2, or very nearly so.\n In classical music from Western culture, a fifth is the interval from the first to the last of five consecutive notes in a diatonic scale. The perfect fifth (often abbreviated P5) spans seven semitones, while the diminished fifth spans six and the augmented fifth spans eight semitones. For example, the interval from C to G is a perfect fifth, as the note G lies seven semitones above C.Play (help\u00b7info)\n The perfect fifth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the second and third harmonics. In a diatonic scale, the dominant note is a perfect fifth above the tonic note.\n The perfect fifth is more consonant, or stable, than any other interval except the unison and the octave. It occurs above the root of all major and minor chords (triads) and their extensions. Until the late 19th century, it was often referred to by one of its Greek names, diapente. Its inversion is the perfect fourth.  The octave of the fifth is the twelfth.\n A perfect fifth is at the start of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\"; the pitch of the first \"twinkle\" is the root note and pitch of the second \"twinkle\" is a perfect fifth above it.",

  "/wiki/Perfect_fourth": "A fourth is a musical interval encompassing four staff positions in the music notation of Western culture, and a perfect fourth (Play (help\u00b7info)) is the fourth spanning five semitones (half steps, or half tones). For example, the ascending interval from C to the next F is a perfect fourth, because the note F is the fifth semitone above C, and there are four staff positions between C and F. Diminished and augmented fourths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (four and six, respectively).\n The perfect fourth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the third and fourth harmonics. The term perfect identifies this interval as belonging to the group of perfect intervals, so called because they are neither major nor minor (unlike thirds, which are either minor or major) but perfect.\n A perfect fourth in just intonation corresponds to a pitch ratio of 4:3, or about 498 cents (Play (help\u00b7info)), while in equal temperament a perfect fourth is equal to five semitones, or 500 cents (see additive synthesis).\n Until the late 19th century, the perfect fourth was often called by its Greek name, diatessaron. Its most common occurrence is between the fifth and upper root of all major and minor triads and their extensions.\n An example of a perfect fourth is the beginning of the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Wagner's Lohengrin (\"Treulich gef\u00fchrt\", the colloquially-titled \"Here Comes the Bride\"). Other examples are the first two notes of the Christmas carol \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" and \"El C\u00f3ndor Pasa\", and, for a descending perfect fourth, the second and third notes of \"O Come All Ye Faithful\".[citation needed]\n The perfect fourth is a perfect interval like the unison, octave, and perfect fifth, and it is a sensory consonance. In common practice harmony, however, it is considered a stylistic dissonance in certain contexts, namely in two-voice textures and whenever it appears above the bass. If the bass note also happens to be the chord's root, the interval's upper note almost always temporarily displaces the third of any chord, and, in the terminology used in popular music, is then called a suspended fourth.\n Conventionally, adjacent strings of the double bass and of the bass guitar are a perfect fourth apart when unstopped, as are all pairs but one of adjacent guitar strings under standard guitar tuning. Sets of tom-tom drums are also commonly tuned in perfect fourths. The 4:3 just perfect fourth arises in the C major scale between G and C. Play (help\u00b7info)",

  "/wiki/Major_third": "In classical music from Western culture, a third is a musical interval encompassing three staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major third (Play (help\u00b7info)) is a third spanning four semitones. Along with the minor third, the major third is one of two commonly occurring thirds. It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two: the major third spans four semitones, the minor third three. For example, the interval from C to E is a major third, as the note E lies four semitones above C, and there are three staff positions from C to E. Diminished and augmented thirds span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (two and five).\n The major third may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the fourth and fifth harmonics. \nThe major scale is so named because of the presence of this interval between its tonic and mediant (1st and 3rd) scale degrees. \nThe major chord also takes its name from the presence of this interval built on the chord's root (provided that the interval of a perfect fifth from the root is also present or implied).\n A major third is slightly different in different musical tunings: in just intonation corresponds to a pitch ratio of 5:4 (play (help\u00b7info)) (fifth harmonic in relation to the fourth) or 386.31 cents; in equal temperament, a major third is equal to four semitones, a ratio of 21/3:1 (about 1.2599) or 400 cents, 13.69 cents wider than the 5:4 ratio. The older concept of a ditone (two 9:8 major seconds) made a dissonantly wide major third with the ratio 81:64 (408 cents) (play (help\u00b7info)). The septimal major third is 9:7 (435 cents), the undecimal major third is 14:11 (418 cents), and the tridecimal major third is 13:10  (454 cents) .\n A helpful way to recognize a major third is to hum the first two notes of \"Kumbaya\" or of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". A descending major third is heard at the starts of \"Goodnight, Ladies\" and \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\".[citation needed]\n In equal temperament three major thirds in a row are equal to an octave (for example, A\u266d to C, C to E, and E to G\u266f; G\u266f and A\u266d represent the same note). This is sometimes called the \"circle of thirds\". In just intonation, however, three 5:4 major thirds are less than an octave. For example, three 5:4 major thirds from C is B\u266f (C to E to G\u266f to B\u266f). The difference between this just-tuned B\u266f and C, like that between G\u266f and A\u266d, is called a diesis, about 41 cents.\n The major third is classed as an imperfect consonance and is considered one of the most consonant intervals after the unison, octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. In the common practice period, thirds were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the sixths, but in medieval times they were considered dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority.\n A diminished fourth is enharmonically equivalent to a major third (that is, it spans the same number of semitones). For example, B\u2013D\u266f is a major third; but if the same pitches are spelled B and E\u266d, the interval is instead a diminished fourth. B\u2013E\u266d occurs in the C harmonic minor scale.\n The major third is used in guitar tunings. For the standard tuning, only the interval between the 3rd and 2nd strings (G to B, respectively) is a major third; each of the intervals between the other pairs of consecutive strings is a perfect fourth. In an alternative tuning, the major-thirds tuning, each of the intervals are major thirds.",

  "/wiki/Major_tenth": "In music, the third factor of a chord is the note or pitch two scale degrees above the root or tonal center. When the third is the bass note, or lowest note, of the expressed triad, the chord is in first inversion Play (help\u00b7info).\n Conventionally, the third is third in importance to the root and fifth, with the third in all primary triads (I, IV, V and i, iv, v) being either major or minor. In jazz chords and theory, the third is required due to it determining chord quality.\n The third in both major and augmented chords is major (E\u266e in C) and the third in both minor and diminished chords is minor (E\u266d in C).",

  "/wiki/Major_sixth": "In music from Western culture, a sixth is a musical interval encompassing six note letter names or staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and the major sixth is one of two commonly occurring sixths. It is qualified as major because it is the larger of the two. The major sixth spans nine semitones. Its smaller counterpart, the minor sixth, spans eight semitones. For example, the interval from C up to the nearest A is a major sixth. It is a sixth because it encompasses six note letter names (C, D, E, F, G, A) and six staff positions. It is a major sixth, not a minor sixth, because the note A lies nine semitones above C. Diminished and augmented sixths (such as C\u266f to A\u266d and C to A\u266f) span the same number of note letter names and staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (seven and ten).\n A commonly cited example of a melody featuring the major sixth as its opening is \"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean\".\n The major sixth is one of the consonances of common practice music, along with the unison, octave, perfect fifth, major and minor thirds, minor sixth, and (sometimes) the perfect fourth. In the common practice period, sixths were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the thirds. In medieval times theorists always described them as Pythagorean major sixths of 27/16 and therefore considered them dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority. We cannot know how major sixths actually were sung in the Middle Ages. In just intonation, the (5/3) major sixth is classed as a consonance of the 5-limit.\n A major sixth is also used in transposing music to E-flat instruments, like the alto clarinet, alto saxophone, E-flat tuba, trumpet, natural horn, and alto horn when in E-flat, as a written C sounds like E-flat on those instruments.\n Assuming close-position voicings for the following examples, the major sixth occurs in a first inversion minor triad, a second inversion major triad, and either inversion of a diminished triad. It also occurs in the second and third inversions of a dominant seventh chord.\n The septimal major sixth (12/7) is approximated in 53 tone equal temperament by an interval of 41 steps or 928 cents.",

  "/wiki/Septimal_tritone": "A septimal tritone is a tritone (about one half of an octave) that involves the factor seven. \nThere are two that are inverses. The lesser septimal tritone (also Huygens' tritone) is the musical interval with ratio 7:5 (582.51 cents). The greater septimal tritone (also Euler's tritone), is an interval with ratio 10:7 (617.49 cents). They are also known as the sub-fifth and super-fourth, or subminor fifth and supermajor fourth, respectively.\n The 7:5 interval (diminished fifth) is equal to a 6:5 minor third plus a 7:6 subminor third.\n The 10:7 interval (augmented fourth) is equal to a 5:4 major third plus an 8:7 supermajor second, or a 9:7 supermajor third plus a 10:9 major second.\n The difference between these two is the septimal sixth tone (50:49, 34.98 cents) Play (help\u00b7info).\n 12 equal temperament and 22 equal temperament do not distinguish between these tritones; 19 equal temperament does distinguish them but doesn't match them closely. 31 equal temperament and 41 equal temperament both distinguish between and closely match them.\n The lesser septimal tritone is the most consonant tritone when measured by combination tones, harmonic entropy, and period length.\n Depending on the temperament used, \"the\" tritone, defined as three whole tones, may be identified as either a lesser septimal tritone (in septimal meantone systems), a greater septimal tritone (when the tempered fifth is around 703 cents), neither (as in 72 equal temperament), or both (in 12 equal temperament only).",

  "/wiki/Major_second": "In Western music theory, a major second (sometimes also called whole tone)  is a second spanning two semitones (Play (help\u00b7info)). A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions (see Interval number for more details). For example, the interval from C to D is a major second, as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions. Diminished, minor and augmented seconds are notated on adjacent staff positions as well, but consist of a different number of semitones (zero, one, and three).\n The major second is the interval that occurs between the first and second degrees of a major scale, the tonic and the supertonic. On a musical keyboard, a major second is the interval between two keys separated by one key, counting white and black keys alike. On a guitar string, it is the interval separated by two frets. In moveable-do solf\u00e8ge, it is the interval between do and re. It is considered a melodic step, as opposed to larger intervals called skips.\n Intervals composed of two semitones, such as the major second and the diminished third, are also called tones, whole tones, or whole steps.\nIn just intonation, major seconds can occur in at least two different frequency ratios:\n9:8 (about 203.9 cents) and 10:9 (about 182.4 cents). The largest (9:8) ones are called major tones or greater tones, the smallest (10:9) are called minor tones or lesser tones. Their size differs by exactly one syntonic comma (81:80, or about 21.5 cents).\nSome equal temperaments, such as 15-ET and 22-ET, also distinguish between a greater and a lesser tone.\n The major second was historically considered one of the most dissonant intervals of the diatonic scale, although much 20th-century music saw it reimagined as a consonance. It is common in many different musical systems, including Arabic music, Turkish music and music of the Balkans, among others.  It occurs in both diatonic and pentatonic scales.\n Listen to a major second in equal temperament (help\u00b7info). Here, middle C is followed by D, which is a tone 200 cents sharper than C, and then by both tones together.",

The size of a ditone varies according to the sizes of the two tones of which it is compounded.
