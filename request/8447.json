The city is the Mid Sweden University's largest campus site with approximately 7,000 students. With a total population of 50,960 (2017) \u00d6stersund is the 22nd most populous city in Sweden, the 46th most populous city in Scandinavia, and by far the largest inland city in Northern Sweden.\n The city was the only Swedish city founded and chartered in the 18th century. \u00d6stersund was founded in order to create a trade monopoly over J\u00e4mtland whose inhabitants' lucrative trade annoyed the Swedish crown. The intention was to persuade the local farmers to deliver merchandise to middlemen in \u00d6stersund, but the population opposed this economic philosophy, and \u00d6stersund long remained small. It took until the end of the 19th century for \u00d6stersund to truly become a city, after the arrival of the railroad and the economic liberalization of that time.\n \u00d6stersund is situated in inland Scandinavia and connected to Sundsvall in the east on the Swedish coast, and Trondheim in the west at the shores of the Norwegian sea. \u00d6stersund is located in the middle of Scandinavia, in the middle of Sweden, in the middle of J\u00e4mtland County and in the middle of \u00d6stersund Municipality. As the most centrally located city in Sweden, the city credits itself as the centre of Sweden.\n \u00d6stersund is marketed as Vinterstaden \u2013 Winter City. Winter City as a project is run by the Municipality together with city enterprises. \u00d6stersund has had a long history as a centre of outdoor activities with a modern cross-country ski stadium and an actual piste in the city itself. \u00d6stersund has also hosted several World Championships in various sports such as biathlon, speed skating and ski orienteering along with Swedish National Championships in cross country skiing and snocross. The city has been the applicant city of Sweden for several Winter Olympic Games, but has yet to host one. The precursor to the Winter Olympic Games, the Nordic Games, were however held at several occasions in the city, due to lack of snow in Stockholm.",
