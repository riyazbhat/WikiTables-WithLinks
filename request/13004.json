  "/wiki/Memorial_Coliseum_(University_of_Kentucky)": "Memorial Coliseum is an 8,500-seat multi-purpose arena in Lexington, Kentucky. The facility, which opened in 1950, is home to three women's teams at the University of Kentucky \u2013 basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics. Before Rupp Arena opened in 1976, it also housed the men's basketball team. Memorial Coliseum also housed the university's swimming and diving team prior to the 1989 completion of the Lancaster Aquatics Center.\n The facility was built as a memorial to Kentuckians who had died during World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Later, the names of all Kentuckians who died in the Vietnam War were added. Originally, it had an official capacity of 12,000, making it the largest arena in the South at the time. However, the Coliseum frequently drew crowds of over 13,000 for many UK basketball games. A major renovation, completed in 1990, reduced the seating capacity to its current total of 8,500 and added an elaborate weight training facility, new offices for the basketball and athletics programs, a players' lounge, and a team meeting room.  The seating is now mostly located on the sidelines, and the men's NCAA basketball championship banners still hang on the walls. The building is known for its air of great tradition.  While it was the home of the UK men's basketball team, it hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament ten times, four times as a regional site (1957, 1958, 1967, 1968) and six more as a sub-regional site (1955, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1967, 1975). As home to the University of Kentucky Wildcats, it saw two NCAA men's basketball national championship teams (1951, 1958), two NCAA men's basketball runner-up teams (1966, 1975), one NIT Men's Basketball champion (1976), and 16 Southeastern Conference (SEC) Men's Basketball regular season champions. Overall, in 26 seasons (1950\u201351 to 1975\u201376), the  University of Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team posted a home record of 307\u201338 (.890). Memorial hosted a first-round game in the 2009 National Invitation Tournament on March 17, 2009 between the Wildcats and the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, with the Wildcats winning 70\u201360. The game was held at Memorial instead of Rupp Arena due to a scheduling conflict with the KHSAA boys' high school basketball state tournament scheduled at Rupp that week.\n The Coliseum was also the home of the Kentucky Boys' Sweet Sixteen State Basketball Tournament from 1951 to 1964. Since then, it has hosted numerous high school basketball tournaments over the years.\n The Coliseum stands across the street from the former site of Stoll Field/McLean Stadium, the football team's home before moving to the venue now known as Kroger Field in 1973. Prior to the building of the Coliseum, the Kentucky basketball teams played less than three blocks away at Alumni Gymnasium, a 2,800-seat arena built in 1924 and now converted to a student fitness center.",
  "/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_women's_basketball": "The Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball team represent the University of Kentucky in the Southeastern Conference, which has historically been the most dominant conference in women's basketball. However, despite reaching national rankings as high as #4, the team has never reached the national championship semifinals (\"Final Four\"). Through the end of the 2009\u201310 season, the team's all-time varsity record (excluding non-varsity seasons prior to 1974) was 603\u2013455, the team had won the SEC Women's Basketball Tournament (1982), and appeared in the NCAA Tournament fourteen times with a tournament record of 7-7.\n The first University of Kentucky women's basketball team was organized in 1902, and competed for the first time on Feb. 21, 1903. However, in 1924, despite a perfect 10-0 season, the University Senate passed a bill to abolish women's basketball in part because, according to state politicians, \"basketball had proven to be a strenuous sport for boys and therefore was too strenuous for girls.\" After 50 years, women's basketball was granted varsity status in 1974, and most of the official records maintained by the university only reflect games since that time. The team, coached by Sue Feamster, was given the nickname \"Lady Kats\", which continued to be used until May 1995.\n Led by UK all-time leading scorer Valerie Still, Patty Jo Hedges, and Lea Wise, the Lady Kats won the SEC Tournament in 1982. The following year, the same trio led the team to a #4 ranking in the country, the highest in the team's history.\n The team is currently coached by Matthew Mitchell.",
  "/wiki/Southern_High_School_(Kentucky)": "Southern High School Magnet Career Academy (MCA) was built in 1951, and the first graduating class was in 1952. Its mission is to prepare students to be \"productive members of a technologically advanced society.\"\n Unlike in many high schools, students eventually choose a \"major,\" including business technology, telecommunications, machine tool and die technology, and transportation technology.\n Starting in the 2011\u201312 school year, the \"Freshman Academy\", which is devoted to help freshmen adjust to high school, was opened. Freshmen do not have their own lunch. However, they have taken a part of the 3rd and 2nd floor to be used as the Freshman Academy area. \n Starting in the 2011\u20132012 school year, with the new principal came a change known as \"Southern 3.0 Upgrade\", in which the school has become more involved and more rigorous with learning.",

  "/wiki/Sports_in_Kentucky": "Despite the national stereotype that Kentucky is a diehard basketball state, at the high school level the state produces many times over more top nationally ranked football players than basketball. In the past ten years the state has produced many players ranked among the top 20 in their position, notably Tim Couch, Chris Redman, Dennis Johnson, Eric Shelton, Michael Bush, Brian Brohm, Mario Urrutia, Earl Heyman, Andr\u00e9 Woodson, Micah Johnson, and DeVante Parker. An increasingly growing number of top baseball talent is also coming from Kentucky, such as Brandon Webb, Austin Kearns, and Paul Byrd.\n Louisville has had practically a monopoly on the state's top players since their recent success on the national stage. The football Cardinals have historically depended on the states of Florida and Georgia for a majority of their talent, and currently over 65% of the team's starters are from those two states.\n As of 2012, there were six high school rugby teams in Kentucky."
