Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. Before Lincoln took office in March, a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States.

They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South, who advocated for states' rights in order to uphold slavery.
