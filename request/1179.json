  "/wiki/Broadcast_syndication": "Broadcasting syndication is the license to broadcast television programs and radio programs by multiple television stations and radio stations, without going through a broadcast network.

The three main types of syndication are \"first-run syndication\", which is programming that is broadcast for the first time as a syndicated show and is made specifically to sell directly into syndication; \"off-network syndication\" (colloquially called a \"rerun\"), which is the licensing of a program that was originally run on network TV or in some cases, first-run syndication; and \"public broadcasting syndication\".",
