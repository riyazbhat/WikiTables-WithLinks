  "/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_S%C3%A9rie_B": "The Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B, commonly referred to as the Brasileir\u00e3o S\u00e9rie B or simply S\u00e9rie B, until 2017 officially known as Brasileir\u00e3o Chevrolet like the S\u00e9rie A by sponsor reasons , is the second tier of the Brazilian football league system. The competition format has changed almost every year since it first occurred in 1971. In some years, it was not played at all. Since 2006 it has been contested by 20 teams in a double round-robin format with the top four teams being promoted to the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A and the bottom four teams being relegated to the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C.",

  "/wiki/Star_(football_badge)": "In football, some national and club teams include one or more stars as part of (or beside) the team badge (often referred to as a \"crest\") appearing on their shirt, to represent important trophies the team has previously won.  Often this is a unilateral decision by a team itself,  rather than a specific privilege earned or sanctioned by any governing body (e.g. as with the FIFA Champions Badge), and as such, the relevance of these stars on a club's shirt is somewhat tenuous."
