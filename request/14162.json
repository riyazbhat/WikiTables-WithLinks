  "/wiki/Verrucomicrobia": "Verrucomicrobia is a phylum of bacteria. This phylum contains only a few described species (Verrucomicrobium spinosum, is an example, the phylum is named after this). The species identified have been isolated from fresh water, marine and soil environments and human faeces. A number of as-yet uncultivated species have been identified in association with eukaryotic hosts including extrusive explosive ectosymbionts of protists and endosymbionts of nematodes residing in their gametes. While verrucae is another name for the warts often found on hands and feet, this phylum is so called not because it is a causative agent thereof, but because of its wart-like morphology.",
  "/wiki/Chlamydia_(bacterium)": "Chlamydia is a genus of pathogenic bacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites. Chlamydia infections are the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in humans and are the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide.",
  "/wiki/Chlamydia_muridarum": "Chlamydia muridarum is an intracellular bacterial species that at one time belonged to Chlamydia trachomatis.  However, C. trachomatis naturally only infects humans and C. muridarum naturally infects only members of the family Muridae (includes both mice and hamsters, Alderton, 1996).",
  "/wiki/Chlamydiae": "The Chlamydiae are bacterial phylum and class whose members are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria, whose members are remarkably diverse, ranging from pathogens of humans and animals to symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa.\nThey are ovoid in shape and stain Gram-negative. Historically it was believed that all  Chlamydiae species had a peptidoglycan-free cell wall, but recent work demonstrates a detectable presence of peptidoglycan, as well as other important proteins. Many species belonging to this order are susceptible to antimicrobial agents.\nAll known Chlamydiae only grow by infecting eukaryotic host cells.  They are as small as or smaller than many viruses. They are dependent on replication inside the host cells, thus some species are termed obligate intracellular pathogens and others are symbionts of ubiquitous protozoa. Most intracellular Chlamydiae are located in an inclusion body or vacuole. Outside cells, they survive only as an extracellular infectious form. Chlamydiae can grow only where their host cells grow, and develop according to a characteristic biphasic developmental cycle. Therefore, Chlamydiae cannot be propagated in bacterial culture media in the clinical laboratory. Chlamydiae are most successfully isolated while still inside their host cells. Chlamydiae is the most common bacterial STD in the United States and 2.86 million chlamydiae infections are reported annually.",

C. trachomatis is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium.",

  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_abortus": "Chlamydia abortus is a species in Chlamydiae that causes abortion and fetal death in mammals, including humans. Chlamydia abortus was renamed in 1999 as Chlamydophila psittaci along with all Chlamydiae except Chlamydia trachomatis.  This was based on a lack of evident glycogen production and on resistance to the antibiotic sulfadiazine.  In 1999 C. psittaci and C. abortus were recognized as distinct species based on differences of pathogenicity and DNA\u2013DNA hybridization. In 2015, this new name was reverted to Chlamydia.",
  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_caviae": "Chlamydia caviae is a bacterium that can be recovered from the conjunctiva of Guinea pigs suffering from ocular inflammation and eye discharge.  It is also possible to infect the genital tract of Guinea pigs with C. caviae and elicit a disease that is very similar to human Chlamydia trachomatis infection.  C. caviae infects primarily the mucosal epithelium and is not invasive.",
  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_felis": "Chlamydia felis (formerly Chlamydophila felis and before that Chlamydia psittaci var. felis) is a bacterium endemic among domestic cats worldwide, primarily causing inflammation of feline conjunctiva, rhinitis and respiratory problems. C. felis can be recovered from the stomach and reproductive tract. Zoonotic infection of humans with C. felis has been reported. Strains FP Pring and FP Cello have an extrachromosomal plasmid, whereas the FP Baker strain does not. FP Cello produces lethal disease in mice, whereas the FP Baker does not. An attenuated FP Baker strain, and an attenuated 905 strain, are used as live vaccines for cats.",
  "/wiki/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae": "Chlamydia pneumoniae is a species of Chlamydia, an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects humans and is a major cause of pneumonia. It was known as the Taiwan acute respiratory agent (TWAR) from the names of the two original isolates\u00a0\u2013 Taiwan (TW-183) and an acute respiratory isolate designated AR-39. Briefly, it was known as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and that name is used as an alternate in some sources. In some cases, to avoid confusion, both names are given.",
