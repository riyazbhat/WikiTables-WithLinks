Wasilla is the largest city in the borough and a part of the Anchorage metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 399,148 in 2018.\n Established at the intersection of the Alaska Railroad and Old Carle Wagon Road, the city prospered at the expense of the nearby mining town of Knik. Historically entrepreneurial, the economic base shifted in the 1970s from small-scale agriculture and recreation to support for workers employed in Anchorage or on Alaska's North Slope oilfields and related infrastructure. The George Parks Highway turned the town into a commuter suburb of Anchorage.  Several state and federal agencies have offices in Wasilla, including the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and Divisions of Public Assistance, Social Services.\n Wasilla gained international attention when Sarah Palin, who served as Mayor of Wasilla before her election as Governor of Alaska, was chosen by John McCain as his running mate for Vice President of the United States in the 2008 United States presidential election.\n Wasilla is named after Chief Wasilla, a local Dena'ina chief. \"Wasilla\" is the anglicized spelling of the chief's Russian-given name, \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0301\u043b\u0438\u0439 Vasilij, which corresponds to the English name Basil.",

  "/wiki/Independence_Mines": "The Independence Mines, now Independence Mine State Historic Park, is the site of a former gold mining operation in the Talkeetna Mountains, across Hatcher Pass from Palmer, Alaska.  The area's mining history dates to at least 1897, when active claims were reported in the vicinity of Fishook Creek.  These early mining efforts were eventually joined to form the Wasilla Mining Company, which worked the mines from 1934 to 1943, and again from 1948 to 1950.  The mining operation at Independence was the second-largest hard-rock gold mining operation in the state, after a larger site near Juneau.  The company and the miners that preceded it built a substantial mining camp, with as many as sixteen wood frame buildings, which were originally connected to each other by sheltered wooden \"tunnels\".  When the company ended operations in 1950, it had expected to eventually resume operations, but never did; this resulted in a particularly well-preserved collection of mining equipment and buildings, although the weather has since taken a significant toll on the latter.\n The mining camp was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
