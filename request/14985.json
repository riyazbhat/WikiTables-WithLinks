The draft is known officially as the \"NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting\" and has been conducted annually since 1936. The draft took place April 20\u201321, 2002 at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The draft was broadcast on ESPN both days and eventually moved to ESPN2. The draft began with the Houston Texans selecting David Carr, and it ended with the Texans selecting Mr. Irrelevant, Ahmad Miller. There were thirty-two compensatory selections distributed among eighteen teams, with the Buffalo Bills receiving the most selections with four. The University of Miami was the college most represented in the draft, having five of its players selected in the first round.  Although the Carolina Panthers finished with a 1\u201315 record which would normally have given them the first pick in each round, the Houston Texans were given the first pick because they were an expansion team.  The league also held a supplemental draft after the regular draft and before the regular season."
