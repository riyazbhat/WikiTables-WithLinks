  "/wiki/Vermont_Republic": "The government of Vermont from 1777 to 1791 has been called the Vermont Republic since the 20th century. In January 1777, delegates from 28 towns met and declared independence from the jurisdictions and land claims of the British colony of Quebec, and from the American states of New Hampshire and New York. They called this territory \"New Connecticut\" (see Connecticut River) and sometimes referred to it by the name of the Green Mountains. The delegates also abolished adult slavery within their republic. Many Vermonters took part in the American Revolution, even though the Continental Congress did not recognize the jurisdiction's independence. Because of objections from New York, which had conflicting property claims, the Continental Congress declined to recognize Vermont, then sometimes also known as the New Hampshire Grants. Vermont's overtures to join the Province of Quebec were accepted by the British, offering generous terms for the Republic's reunion. When the main British army surrendered in 1781, however, American independence became apparent. Vermont, now bordered on three sides by American territory, rejected the British claims and instead negotiated terms to enter the United States. In 1791, Vermont officially joined the United States as the 14th state.",
  "/wiki/Elizabeth_Freeman_(Mum_Bett)": "Elizabeth Freeman (c.1744 \u2013 December 28, 1829), also known as Bet, Mum Bett, or MumBet, was the first enslaved African American to file and win a freedom suit in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling, in Freeman's favor, found slavery to be inconsistent with the 1780 Massachusetts State Constitution. Her suit, Brom and Bett v. Ashley (1781), was cited in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appellate review of Quock Walker's freedom suit.  When the court upheld Walker's freedom under the state's constitution, the ruling was considered to have implicitly ended slavery in Massachusetts.",
  "/wiki/Quock_Walker": "Quock Walker, also known as Kwaku or Quok Walker (b. 1753 \u2013 d. unknown), was an American slave who sued for and won his freedom in June 1781 in a case citing language in the new Massachusetts Constitution (1780) that declared all men to be born free and equal. The case is credited with helping abolish slavery in Massachusetts, although the 1780 constitution was never amended to explicitly prohibit the practice.  Massachusetts was the first state of the union to effectively and fully abolish slavery.  By the 1790 federal census, no slaves were recorded in the state.",

She earned more than the wage she paid to her owner and used the surplus to buy another slave girl, Sally, whom she manumitted. Following purchase and manumission, Beatty did not claim Sally as his property and did not pay taxes for her. However, when Beatty was called on after some time to produce Sally as a free person, Beatty refused; the case was then brought to the courts.",

She had sued for freedom for herself and her two children based on her claim of descent from Indian women. Indian slavery had been prohibited in Virginia since 1705.

Decker & Hopkins (1818) was a freedom suit in which the Supreme Court of Mississippi ruled that the three slaves in the case were freed based on prior residence in the Northwest Territory, established as free in 1787.

She petitioned for her freedom and that of her son James (John) Henry from William Walker (a slave trader), based on having been held illegally as a slave in the free territory of Michigan by a previous master, an Army officer.  Her case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri, where she won. The court ruled that an Army officer forfeited his slave if he took the person to territory where slavery is prohibited.  This ruling was cited as precedent in 1856 in the famous Dred Scott v. Sandford case before the Supreme Court of the United States.",

Graham, 51 U.S. (10 How.) 82 (1851), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the status of three slaves who went from Kentucky to Indiana and Ohio depended on Kentucky law rather than Ohio law. The original plaintiff was Christopher Graham, whose three slaves had traveled to Cincinnati, Ohio, aboard a steamboat owned by Jacob Strader and James Gorman and piloted by John Armstrong. The slaves later escaped to Canada. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the authority of the Northwest Ordinance of 1789 over its applicable territories in Strader v.

  "/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford": "Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court held that the Constitution of the United States was not meant to include American citizenship for black people, regardless of whether they were enslaved or free, and therefore the rights and privileges it confers upon American citizens could not apply to them. The decision was made in the case of Dred Scott, an enslaved black man whose owners had taken him from Missouri, which was a slave-holding state, into the Missouri Territory, most of which had been designated \"free\" territory by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. When his owners later brought him back to Missouri, Scott sued in court for his freedom, claiming that because he had been taken into \"free\" U.S. territory, he had automatically been freed, and was legally no longer a slave. Scott sued first in Missouri state court, which ruled that he was still a slave under its law. He then sued in U.S. federal court, which ruled against him by deciding that it had to apply Missouri law to the case.  He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

Booth, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 506 (1859), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that State courts cannot issue rulings on federal law that contradict the decisions of federal courts, overturning a decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. The U.S. Supreme Court held that under the Constitution, the federal courts have the final power to decide cases arising under the Constitution and federal statutes, and that the States do not have the power to overturn those decisions. Thus, Wisconsin did not have the authority to nullify federal judgments or statutes.  For example, it is illegal for State officials to interfere with the work of U.S. Marshals acting under federal laws.  The Ableman decision emphasized the dual form of American government and the independence of State and federal courts from one another.",
