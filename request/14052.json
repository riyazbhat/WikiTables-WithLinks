  "/wiki/Anthrax_(American_band)": "Anthrax is an American heavy metal band from New York City, formed in 1981 by rhythm guitarist Scott Ian and bassist Dan Lilker. The group is considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene from the 1980s and is one of the Big Four thrash metal bands with Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer; Anthrax is the only one of the four from the East Coast, and often credited as one of the early thrash metal bands to emerge from there, along with Overkill and Nuclear Assault. The band has released 11 studio albums, several other albums, and 26 singles, including collaborating on a single with American hip hop group Public Enemy. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with worldwide sales of 10 million. Noted for its live performances, Anthrax signed with the independent label Megaforce Records, which released the band's debut studio album Fistful of Metal in 1984. Lilker soon left the band to form Nuclear Assault, and was replaced by roadie Frank Bello. Lead vocalist Neil Turbin was replaced after two years by Matt Fallon, who was then subsequently replaced in 1984 by Joey Belladonna. With a new lineup, Anthrax recorded Spreading the Disease (distributed by Island Records) in 1985. Their third album, Among the Living, was released in 1987 to critical praise and eventually received gold certification by the RIAA. The band continued this success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the albums State of Euphoria (1988), Persistence of Time (1990) and the compilation Attack of the Killer B's (1991) entering the Top 30 on the Billboard 200 and selling over half a million units. Their next lineup change took place in 1992, when John Bush from Armored Saint replaced Belladonna as lead vocalist. Sound of White Noise was released the following year, and entered the Billboard 200 at number seven, which remains Anthrax's highest chart position.",
  "/wiki/Psychobilly_Freakout": "Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em is the first album by psychobilly trio The Reverend Horton Heat. It was released in November 1990 on Sub Pop. An early version of the album had been recorded in the traditional manner (instruments and vocals recorded separately, then mixed in the studio). However, the band and the label decided that it did not fit with their vision, so it was re-recorded live in the studio direct to two-track, with the exception of Love Whip. The phrase Smoke 'em if You Got 'em or Smoke if You Got 'em predates this album and is slang for do what you want, if you have the means. The first phrase was popular during World War II meaning to take a break. Officers would say Smoke 'em if you got 'em allowing the soldiers to take a break and smoke their cigarettes. [Vic Morrow - Combat!

The song 'Psychobilly Freakout' was covered by WaveGroup Cover Studios for Activision's Guitar Hero II video game.",
