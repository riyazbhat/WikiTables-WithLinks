Portugal also made it to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 1984 final tournament, losing 3\u20132 after extra time to the hosts and eventual winners France.\n During this time, Portugal was not part of a group of teams that were candidates to win titles, but from 2000 until this present day, the team evolved, being present in all the final stages of major tournaments, due to the presence of several world-class players such as Lu\u00eds Figo, Rui Costa, Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who were dubbed as Portugal's golden generation, who were considered as the best of the world at their time and among the best in history. Portugal's golden generation helped Portugal reach the semi-finals of Euro 2000, losing 2\u20131 after extra time to eventual winners France, securing the second place at Euro 2004 Final after losing to Greece on home soil, as well reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup losing to finalist France, after a penalty, leading Portugal to secure the fourth place in the tournament, after losing to 3\u20131 to hosts Germany, thus being the best result since the 1966 World Cup. Despite losing many players of the golden generation, new players such as F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Nani and Pepe helped the Portuguese reach the semi-finals of Euro 2012, losing to Spain in penalties, with Cristiano Ronaldo finishing as joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals. \n In 2014, Fernando Santos was appointed as the new head coach for the national team. Two years later at Euro 2016, Santos brought Portugal its first ever major trophy, defeating hosts France 1\u20130 after extra time, with the winning goal scored by Eder. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its first appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place. Portugal hosted the brand new 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League as well as winning the trophy, defeating the Netherlands 1\u20130, with the winning goal scored by Gon\u00e7alo Guedes, making it the second major tournament earned by the Portuguese in three finals.\n Portugal is colloquially referred to as the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o das Quinas (The Navigators) and has notable rivalries with Brazil, with whom they share many common cultural ties and with Spain\u2014known as A Guerra Ib\u00e9rica in Portuguese or The Iberean War in English, with the rivalry between two countries going back to 1581.\n The team's home stadium is the Est\u00e1dio Nacional, in Oeiras, although most of their home games are frequently played in other stadiums across the country. The current head coach is Fernando Santos and the captain is Cristiano Ronaldo, who also holds the team record for most caps and for most goals.",
