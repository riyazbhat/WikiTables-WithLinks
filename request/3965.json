  "/wiki/King_Cobra_(roller_coaster)": "King Cobra (1984\u20132001) was a TOGO Stand-up roller coaster located at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. It was the first in the world to be designed from the ground up as a stand-up roller coaster. Other stand-up roller coasters that preceded King Cobra were sit-down models later modified to accommodate stand-up trains. After the ride's manufacturer, TOGO, went out of business in 2001, parts for the ride became more expensive and harder to find. In addition, the ride was losing popularity in recent years. So in April 2002, Paramount Parks decided to dismantle King Cobra and put it up for sale. Trains were sent to Kings Island's \"graveyard\" located at the old Wild Animal Habitat feeding house area next to the Son of Beast. After the ride wouldn't sell, the decision was made in 2008 to transfer some of the ride including the trains to Kings Dominion to be used as spare parts for Shockwave. As of 2010, remnants of the King Cobra could still be spotted in some back areas of Kings Island near Flight of Fear",
