  "/wiki/Baptist_Church_(Sperry,_Iowa)": "Baptist Church, also known as Stone Church, is a historic church building in Sperry, Iowa, United States. The Baptist congregation that built this church was founded in 1840. They built this building seven years later. In addition to religious services, it was the meeting place for a variety of community events. The church building is surrounded by a cemetery, which contains the graves of some of the areas first settlers. The utilitarian design of the church building and the use of local materials is characteristic of pioneer church architecture in Iowa. The 48-by-36-foot (15 by 11 m) building is a single-story, gable roof structure. It features a cornice return. The roughly cut stone exterior uses larger stones at the corners for a decorative effect. The interior walls are plaster and the flooring are pine boards. It still houses the original hardwood pews, pulpit, minister's settee, and hand-carved altar. The building was damaged in a tornado in 1964, and the repairs conform to the original character of the church. It was added to the National Register in 1977.",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_61": "U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 (US 61) is a major United States highway which extends 1,400 miles (2,300 km) between New Orleans, Louisiana and the city of Wyoming, Minnesota. The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River, and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35). Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth and across the Canada\u2013U.S. border, near Grand Portage. Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (US 90). The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; the Mississippi Delta, and New Orleans.\nThe route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system. Many southerners traveled north along US 61 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul.\n The highway has a long musical history, being the supposed location where singer-songwriter Robert Johnson made a deal with the Devil for his successes.  The road later gave its name to Minnesota native Bob Dylan's album Highway 61 Revisited and to the song of the same name, which imagines all sorts of fantastical events (including World War III) occurring alongside it. Other notable songs named for the highway include a blues song recorded in 1957 by Sunnyland Slim; one in 1962 by Johnny Young; and a 1981 song, \"61 Highway\", by bluesman James \"Son\" Thomas. To denote US 61's significance in blues music history, there are two markers on the route which are part of the Mississippi Blues Trail: 61 Highway in Vicksburg, Mississippi and Highway 61 Blues in Tunica, Mississippi.",

Prior to that year a transfer ferry boat, the President, carried railroad cars and passengers across the river in warmer weather. Passengers would have to walk across the river ice in winter. The railroad continued to use the building for office space until 1884. In that year the frame, Italianate structure was moved from its Main and Market Streets location so the railroad tracks could be widened. After its use by the railroad, it was converted into a residence.

It replaced a smaller brick freight house that had been built in 1873.  The freight house is the only remaining structure from the BCR&N left in Burlington, and the only Victorian structure remaining on the riverfront. The railroad's shops had been located further north in an area called \"The Bottoms.\"  Its original passenger depot was located in a commercial building that was located at Jefferson and Front Streets.  It moved into the CB&Q's Union Depot further south along the riverfront where the Amtrak station is now[when?] located. The BCR&N, with passenger and freight service between Minneapolis and St. Louis was considered the most important north-south rail\nline in Iowa.  In 1903 the railroad was acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, and the freight house served that line.

The depot exemplifies the streamlined mid-century modern aesthetic that came into vogue in the 1930s.

  "/wiki/Mississippi_River": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system. From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, it flows generally south for 2,320 miles (3,730 km) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\nNative Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years. Most were hunter-gatherers, but some, such as the Mound Builders, formed prolific agricultural societies. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers. The river served first as a barrier, forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States, and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.\n Formed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods. During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory, due to the river's strategic importance to the Confederate war effort. Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that replaced steamboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination. A major focus of this work has been to prevent the lower Mississippi from shifting into the channel of the Atchafalaya River and bypassing New Orleans.\n Since the 20th century, the Mississippi River has also experienced major pollution and environmental problems \u2013 most notably elevated nutrient and chemical levels from agricultural runoff, the primary contributor to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone.",

The second period (1895-1929) was an era of maturity and the development of modern commercial buildings.  This is the time period when Burlington's \"tall\" downtown buildings were built.  The third period (1930-1967) saw competition from suburban development, especially in West Burlington.  There were efforts to retain old businesses and attract new ones, while modernizing and improving the area.  The inclusion of West Jefferson Street was important because it was the main thoroughfare in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the Hawkeye Creek Valley.  It led from the central business district along the Mississippi River to the Agency Road that headed westward out of town.\n For the most part the buildings in the district housed commercial enterprises, both retail, banking and professional offices.  The government buildings are, for the most part, located elsewhere.  The taller buildings are located on the east side along Jefferson Street and the adjacent blocks.  Most of the buildings are three to four stories, with the tallest buildings rising eight to nine stories.  There are also numerous one and two story structures.  The buildings are mostly brick.
