He was born Ying Zheng (\u5b34\u653f) or Zhao Zheng (\u8d99\u653f), a prince of the state of Qin. He became Zheng, the King of Qin (\u79e6\u738b\u653f) when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC. Rather than maintain the title of \"king\" (\u738b w\u00e1ng) borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, he ruled as the First Emperor (\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d) of the Qin dynasty from 221 BC to 210 BC. His self-invented title \"emperor\" (\u7687\u5e1d hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec), as indicated by his use of the word \"First\", would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia.\n During his reign, his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state: campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Chinese cultural orbit; campaigns in Central Asia conquered the Ordos Loop from the nomad Xiongnu, although eventually it would also lead to their confederation under Modu Chanyu.\n Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices of the earlier Chinese states. He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars, though a closer examination renders the account doubtful. His public works projects included the unification of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system, as well as the city-sized mausoleum guarded by the life-sized Terracotta Army. He ruled until his death in 210\u2009BC during his fourth tour of Eastern China.",

The film was initially not allowed to be shown in theaters in China for a certain period but was eventually made commercially available in China since.\n Inspired by the novel Survival by You Fengwei, Devils on the Doorstep is set in the last years of the Second Sino-Japanese War during World War II and tells the story of a Chinese villager who is forced by a mysterious figure to take custody of two prisoners from the Japanese Army (Teruyuki and Yuan). Fearing both the mystery man and the Japanese, the village falls into a dilemma over what to do with the two prisoners.\n Contrary to its title, Devils on the Doorstep is not at its core an anti-Japanese war film. In Jiang's own words, the film shows how Chinese literature and film has perpetuated an attitude of blaming the aggressor and casting the Chinese population as passive victims of aggression. Jiang hopes that the film illuminates this common human psychological trait of blaming others for disaster that goes beyond Chineseness.",
