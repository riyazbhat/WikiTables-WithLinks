Those who teach at universities or work in academic, educational, or research fields are usually addressed by this title \"professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation.\" Alternatively, holders may use post-nominal letters such as \"Ph.D.\", \"PhD\", or \"DPhil\" (depending on the awarding institution).
