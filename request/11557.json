  "/wiki/Duncan_Lloyd_McLeod": "Duncan Lloyd McLeod (May 26, 1874\u2014May 10, 1935) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.  He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1935 as a member of the Progressive Party, and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.\n McLeod was born in Glen Huron, Ontario, and was educated at Collingwood Collegiate Institute.  He worked as a teacher, and continued in this profession after moving to Manitoba in 1902.  McLeod served a councillor and reeve in the municipality of Albert, and was active in various farming organizations.\n He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1920, when he lost by ten votes to Liberal incumbent John Williams in the rural southwestern constituency of Arthur.  McLeod ran as an independent farmer candidate, and might have also been endorsed by the local Conservative organization.\n He later joined the United Farmers of Manitoba.  Under its banner, he defeated Williams by 353 votes in the 1922 election.  The United Farmers won an unexpected majority in this election, and formed government as the Progressive Party.  McLeod was appointed as Manitoba's Provincial Secretary and Municipal Commissioner on August 8, 1922.  He gave up the former position on December 3, 1923.\n McLeod was re-elected in the 1927 election, defeating Conservative challenger J. Arthur Ross by 324 votes.  He was retained as Municipal Commissioner, and was appointed Provincial Secretary for a second time on December 31, 1929.  On May 27, 1932, he was also appointed as Manitoba's Railway Commissioner.\n McLeod defeated Ross again in the 1932 election, and was retained in all three cabinet positions.  He was still a member of the government at the time of his death in Winnipeg in 1935.",
  "/wiki/Arthur_(electoral_district)": "Arthur is a former provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba.  It was created in 1903 and was eliminated by redistribution in 1989, when its territory was combined with that from the neighbouring Virden riding to create the new riding of Arthur-Virden.\n The riding was located in the province's southwestern tip, and was primarily agrarian.  From 1953 until its abolition, it was a safe seat for the Progressive Conservative Party.",
  "/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Manitoba": "The Progressive Party of Manitoba, Canada, was a political party that developed from the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM), an agrarian movement that became politically active following World War I. A successor to the Manitoba Grain Growers' Association, the UFM represented the interests of farmers frustrated with traditional political parties.\n Unlike the United Farmers, the Progressive Party of Manitoba never made any serious effort to cooperate with the labour politicians. The Winnipeg General Strike was unpopular among farmers, and the Progressive Party of Manitoba was not generally regarded as friendly to labour.\n A number of \"farmer candidates\" ran in Manitoba's provincial election of 1920.  They were not an organized group, and had no pretensions of forming government; nevertheless, twelve of these candidates were elected\u2014eight as supporters of the UFM, and four as independents.  Had the UFM run a united campaign, it probably would have won the election.\n The Independent-Farmers group was formed to represent the victorious candidates in the parliament which followed.  This was never intended to be a permanent political organization, and dissolved when parliament broke up in 1922.  The group's leader was William Robson, who did not seek re-election thereafter.\n The United Farmers of Manitoba entered electoral politics in 1921, and ran an organized campaign in the 1922 election.  However, expectations were still very low.  They had no leader and a shoestring campaign budget, and only ran candidates in two-thirds of the province's ridings. Despite this, they won 28 out of 55 seats for a strong majority government.\n Faced with the task of selecting a leader who would become the province's new premier, the UFM asked John Bracken, president of the Manitoba Agricultural College, to become party leader and premier-designate.  Once in government, Bracken's followers identified themselves as the Progressive Party of Manitoba, maintaining an affiliation with the UFM.\n Bracken was a political outsider, and gave the party the technocratic credentials that it desired.  The UFM supported the fading away of older political parties, to be replaced by a more \"management-centred\" approach to government.  In later years, the Progressive Party would advocate \"non-partisan government\" for the province, via a series of alliances with other parties.\n In 1928, the UFM decided to withdraw from politics and concentrate on being a service and lobbying organization.  It became the Manitoba Federation of Agriculture.  Part of the reason for separating the Progressive Party from the UFM was the perception that the government had a narrow base representing only farmers, rather than all Manitobans.\n Prior to the 1932 elections, Bracken's Progressives formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party.  This occurred on the urging of federal Liberal leader William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was concerned that the Conservatives could form government in the province.  The \"Liberal-Progressives\" were able to win a majority, and maintained their alliance after the election.  Eventually, they would become a single party.\n The Liberal-Progressive government was reduced to a minority in the 1936 elections.  When early plans to bring the Conservatives into government failed, Bracken required support from the province's five Social Credit MLAs to continue.\n In government, the Progressives were fiscally cautious. With the onset of the Great Depression, however, the government attempted to deal with unemployment by fostering a 'back to the land' movement, giving resettlement grants to move the unemployed from cities and town to the countryside.\n In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government which included the Liberal-Progressives, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, Social Credit, and Conservatives. In 1942, Bracken left provincial politics to take over the leadership of what became the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.\n Stuart S. Garson took over as leader of the party and premier, and was himself replaced by Douglas Lloyd Campbell in 1948.\n The Manitoba CCF left the coalition in 1943. The Conservatives had renamed their party the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba due to the change in name of the federal party, and despite not having any link with the Progressives. The Conservatives left the coalition in 1950 due to dissatisfaction with Campbell's leadership.\n Although the leadership of the party remained dominated by Progressives, the government was commonly referred to as \"Liberal\" during the 1940s and 1950s. Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservatives swept to victory of 1958. The Liberal-Progressives the party formally became known as the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1961.",
  "/wiki/William_Bayley": "William Dowell Bayley (December 24, 1879 \u2013 November 5, 1955) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.  He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1927.\n Bayley was born in Winnipeg, the son of William Dowell Bayley and Lucy Charlotte Carney, of English descent.  One of his ancestors, Sir Thomas Wyatt, was executed for sedition.[citation needed]  Bayley received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba, and was a medallist in philosophy and political economy.  He served as principal of King George Public School in Norwood, and in 1918 lectured on prohibition for the \"dry\" side in New Zealand.\n He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1915, as a candidate of the Labour Representation Committee.  He finished second in Assiniboia, coming 55 behind Liberal candidate John Wilton.\n Labour's electoral fortunes rose in Manitoba after the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919.  Bayley ran for the legislature again in the 1920 provincial election as a candidate of the Dominion Labour Party, and defeated Wilton by 103 votes.  The Liberals won a minority government in this election, and Bayley served as an opposition member of the legislature.  He was re-elected in the 1922 election, which was won by the United Farmers of Manitoba.\n Bayley was known as a strong orator, and had the honour of being the first public school teacher to serve in the Manitoba legislature.  He left the Labour Party caucus on January 8, 1924, shortly after the retirement of party leader Fred Dixon.  He served as an independent member of the legislature after this time, and did not seek re-election in 1927.\n Bayley was appointed head of temperance education after retiring from the legislature, and opposed efforts to liberalize Manitoba's liquor laws.  He attempted a political comeback in 1953, largely in response to Stephen Juba's increased popularity in the city.  Juba, who would later be elected as Winnipeg's Mayor, promoted liquor law reforms as part of a populist platform.  In response, Bayley formed an organization called the Prosperity for Posterity Party (PPP), which was primarily a vehicle to oppose Juba and his views on the issue.\n Bayley registered as a PPP candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1953 provincial election, but withdraw before election day.  He was initially reluctant to run, and allowed his name to stand only after no other volunteers came forward.  When he left the race, he suggested that his candidacy could split the temperance vote.  He also issued the following statement:\n \"I choose to withdraw, thanking the friends of temperance, and of me personally, both those who paid me to run and those who said don't, and apologizing to Winnipeg Centre electors for ever thinking they wouldn't adequately deal with Mr. Juba\".\n He died in Winnipeg at the age of 75 and was buried in Montreal, Quebec.",

It was first created for the 1879 provincial election, was eliminated in 1888, and was re-established in 1903. It is located in the westernmost tip of the City of Winnipeg.\n Assiniboia is bordered on the east by St. James and Lakeside, to the south by Kirkfield Park, to the north by Lakeside, and to the west by Morris.\n The riding's population in 1996 was 20,441. In 1999, the average family income was $53,881, and the unemployment rate was 6.50%. Retail trade accounts for 15% of the riding's industry.\n Until 1920, Assiniboia was a marginal riding between the Manitoba Liberal Party and Conservative Party. Between 1920 and 1949, it was a hotly contested riding between the Conservatives and candidates of the Independent Labour Party and Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).\n The riding was dominated by the Liberals from 1949 until 1977, and then by the Progressive Conservatives from 1977 to 1999.  The New Democratic Party of Manitoba's (NDP) victory in 1999 was completely unexpected, and occurred by a margin of only three votes.",
  "/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party_(Manitoba,_1920)": "The Independent Labour Party was the leading social-democratic party in the Canadian province of Manitoba prior to the emergence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.  Several of its candidates were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and it counted federal Members of Parliament J. S. Woodsworth and A. A. Heaps among its members.\n The ILP was founded in December 1920 by disgruntled members of the Dominion Labour Party, who left that organization when it was taken over by rightist elements.  Like the DLP, the ILP was a reformist labour group, and often had hostile relations with parties further to the left. In the provincial election of 1920, the combined efforts of reformist labourites and socialists resulted in eleven leftists being elected to the Manitoba legislature.  Most of these Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), including parliamentary leader Fred Dixon, were part of the exodus from the DLP to the ILP later in the year. The ILP fell to six seats in the election of 1922, and Dixon resigned from the legislature in 1923 following a family tragedy.  He was replaced as party leader by John Queen, formerly of the Social Democratic Party of Canada. Support for left-wing and labour parties declined throughout Canada in the late 1920s.  Queen led the ILP through the elections of 1927 and 1932, winning three and five seats respectively.  He was replaced by Seymour Farmer in 1935.\n The ILP never affiliated with the Canadian Labour Party.  Initially, this was because the rightist DLP leadership had affiliated itself with the CLP soon after the exodus of ILP members.  There were attempts at a compromise, but divisions between DLP and ILP members were too strong to overcome and the ILP refused to join the \"national\" organization as such.  Later, the ILP would remain out of the CLP due to the large number of communists who joined the latter group in the 1920s.  (The CLP was, in any case, a fairly weak organization in Manitoba, and the ILP leaders had little incentive to merge with their smaller rival.)\n The ILP had a complicated relationship with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s.  The CCF was formed to expand the parliamentary left's support base beyond the urban working class, and many in the ILP were suspicious of this.  The parties nevertheless became aligned in 1933, at a time when the CCF organization in the province was weak.  In three years, the CCF had developed its own identity and was less willing to support the ILP's demands for autonomy.\n The party was referred to as \"ILP-CCF\" during the provincial election of 1936, against the opposition of some traditional ILP supporters.  Following the election (in which the party won seven seats), a group of disgruntled ILP members succeeded in temporarily disaffiliating the parties.  Pressure from David Lewis and J. S. Woodsworth brought about a realignment, but the ILP's relationship with the CCF remained shakey until the early 1940s, when CCF loyalists took over the ILP's internal organization.  These divisions were especially noticeable at the start of the Second World War: the ILP supported an all-out war effort, whereas the CCF favoured conscription of \"wealth before men\".\n The ILP organization officially disbanded in 1943.  It had been superseded by the CCF some time earlier.",

He subsequently moved to Manitoba in 1880, where he worked as a farmer and store manager and served as Reeve of the Municipality of De Salaberry from 1892 to 1896. In 1888, he married Albina L'Heureux. Pr\u00e9fontaine was president of the Carillon Agricultural Society, of the Carey Elevator Company and of the St. Pierre Trading Company.\n Pr\u00e9fontaine was first elected to the provincial parliament in 1903, running for Rodmond Roblin's governing Conservatives in the francophone riding of Carillon.  He was re-elected in 1907 and 1910.\n In 1914, Pr\u00e9fontaine lost his seat to Liberal Thomas Molloy by seven votes.  He was re-elected the following year, despite the disastrous showing of the Conservatives in the rest of the province.  His victory may be credited to the fact that the provincial Conservatives were seen as more supportive of francophone rights than were Tobias Norris's Liberals (indeed, Norris' government withdrew state funding for French-language education soon after the election).\n Conservative leader James Aikins lost his seat in the 1915 election, and Pr\u00e9fontaine was chosen to lead the small opposition caucus in parliament (he was sworn in as leader of the opposition in January 1916).  He declined to be a candidate in the party's leadership convention, held on November 6, 1919.\n Although it had been in government from 1900 to 1915, the Conservative Party of Manitoba was marginalized by developments in the later half of the 1910s.  Increasingly radicalized farmer and labour groups were forming political organizations of their own, and the old divisions between Grit and Tory no longer seemed as relevant.  The Conservatives again fared poorly in the election of 1920, and Pr\u00e9fontaine was personally defeated by Farmer candidate Maurice Duprey.\n After this loss, Pr\u00e9fontaine detached himself from the Conservative Party.  He ran as an Independent in the federal election of 1921, losing to Progressive candidate Arthur-Lucien Beaubien in the Provencher riding, and subsequently left the Conservatives to join the United Farmers of Manitoba.  Running as a UFM candidate, he was re-elected for Carillon in 1922.\n On December 3, 1923, Premier John Bracken appointed Pr\u00e9fontaine to the high-level cabinet positions of Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Railway Commissioner.  Pr\u00e9fontaine also became Minister of Agriculture in 1925.  In the 1927 election, he defeated his old nemesis Thomas Molloy by a landslide.\n Pr\u00e9fontaine stood down as Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Minister of Agriculture in 1928, though he retained the Railway Commissioner's position until 1932.  He was re-elected in that year's general election, and continued to serve the Franco-Manitoban community as a Minister without Portfolio until his death in 1935.\n Pr\u00e9fontaine's career reveals the continued importance of the francophone community to Manitoba politics, even after immigration from Ontario and Eastern Europe had significantly reduced their relative strength.  His decision to join the UFM was indicative of a larger cultural change, as Franco-Manitobans became an important part of the Progressive Party of Manitoba during its long period in government.\n His son Edmond also served in the Manitoba assembly.\n The resort community of Albert Beach, Manitoba (French: \"Plage Albert\") was named after him.",

He was educated at Kolomyja Public School. In 1911, he moved to Ethelbert, where he worked as a merchant. Hryhorczuk married Nelly Dzaman in 1905. From 1917 to 1919, he served as reeve of Ethelbert municipality. Hryhorczuk was a member of the Canadian Foresters.\n Hryhorczuk was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election. Running as an \"Independent Farmer\", he was easily elected in the Ethelbert constituency. In the 1922 election, he was nominated as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) and was re-elected without opposition in a deferred election.\n The UFM won the 1922 election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Hyrhorczuk rallied support for John Bracken to serve as Premier of Manitoba, and later became a backbench supporter of Bracken's government. He was re-elected in the provincial elections of 1927 and 1932.\n Prior to the 1932 election, the Progressive Party formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party. This alliance soon took the form of a merger, and government members became known as \"Liberal-Progressives\".\n Hryhorczuk was unexpectedly defeated in the 1936 provincial election by William Lisowsky, a candidate of the Manitoba Social Credit League. Lisowsky did not seek re-election in the 1941 election, however, and Hryhorczuk was narrowly returned over Fred Zaplitny of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).\n In the 1945 provincial election, CCF candidate Michael Sawchuk defeated Hryhorczuk by 338 votes. This ended Hryhorczuk's career in politics. His son, Michael N. Hryhorczuk, later served in the legislature from 1949 to 1966.\n The elder Hryhorczuk retired from business in 1978, the same year that his son died, and died the following year at age 90.",

He was educated in Galicia. Bachynsky attended teacher's college in Brandon and worked as a teacher before entering politics. In 1920, he married Julia Wlasinuk.\n He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election.

After the election, the UFM formed government as the Progressive Party, and Bachynsky became a backbench supporter of John Bracken's administration.\n Bachynsky again defeated Mabb, who was by this time identifying himself as a Conservative, in the 1927 election. He was again returned with comfortable margins in the elections of 1932 and 1936, now identifying himself as a Liberal-Progressive after an alliance between the province's Liberal and Progressive parties.\n Bachnysky faced a more difficult challenge in the 1941 election, defeating pro-government independent L.W. Michalchuk by just thirty-three votes. He again defeated Michalchuk, then a CCF candidate, in the 1945 election by 121 votes.\n Bachynsky was returned without difficulty in the elections of 1949 and 1953. After serving twenty-eight years as a backbencher, he was appointed Speaker of Legislature by Premier Douglas Campbell on November 7, 1950.\n Bachynsky had difficulty concealing his dislike of the CCF backbench, and once expressed his sympathy to CCF leader Seymour Farmer for putting up with this \"bunch of wild broncos\".  Lloyd Stinson, who became leader of the Manitoba CCF in 1952, claimed Bachynsky was \"such a volatile, vociferous orator that he was temperamentally unsuited to be an impartial moderator\". Stinson also claims that Bachynsky consistently ruled against the CCF on procedural matters after becoming speaker.\n After thirty-six years in the legislature, Bachynsky lost the Fisher constituency by 56 votes to CCF candidate Peter Wagner in the 1958 provincial election.\n He died on his farm in Poplarfield in 1969.",
