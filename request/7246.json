Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Bonne Radford acted as executive producers on the film. Although the film was a financial disappointment (it was overshadowed by the success of the competing Disney-Pixar film Toy Story) its subsequent strong sales on home video led to two direct-to-video sequels: Balto II: Wolf Quest (2002) and  Balto III: Wings of Change (2004), though none of the voice cast reprised their roles.

Huck did not seem to exist in a specific time period as he has also been a Roman gladiator, a medieval knight, and a rocket scientist.

Another regular villain was Dinky Dalton, a rough and tough western outlaw that Huck usually has to capture, and Crazy Coyote, a wild Native American who Huck often had to defeat who was his match. There were also two crows with Mafia accents who often annoyed Farmer Huck. Another trademark of Huck was his tone deaf and inaccurate rendition of \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\", often used as a running gag.",

When finally roused to anger, often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him, Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing (\"You know what? That makes me mad!\").\n The character first appeared, nameless, in Avery's 1943 cartoon Dumb-Hounded. Though he was not called \"Droopy\" onscreen until his fifth cartoon, Se\u00f1or Droopy (1949), the character was already named \"Droopy\" in model sheets for his first cartoon.  He was officially first labeled Happy Hound, a name used in the character's appearances in Our Gang Comics. The original Droopy series ended in 1958 as a result of MGM closing its cartoon department, but the character has been revived several times for new productions including films and television shows also featuring MGM's other famous cartoon stars, Tom and Jerry, either as their ally or enemy.\n In the cartoon Northwest Hounded Police, Droopy's last name was given as \"McPoodle\". In The Chump Champ, it was given as \"Poodle\". Nevertheless, Droopy is generally understood to be a basset hound.",

He also shares the Coyote's appetite and persistent use of Acme Corporation products, but he covets sheep instead of roadrunners and, when he speaks, does not have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote. Another crucial difference is that of personality: Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey, preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day.\n Sam Sheepdog, by contrast, is a large, burly Berger de Brie (Briard) with white or tan fur and a mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes. He very rarely runs and tends to be sedentary in his movements. He does, however, possess sufficient strength to incapacitate Ralph with a single punch once he catches him.",

In each episode, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) to try to catch his prey, which backfire comically, with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme.\n One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff. After he goes over the edge, the rest of the scene, shot from a bird's-eye view, shows him falling into a canyon so deep, that his figure is eventually lost to sight. This is followed, a second or two later, by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits.\n Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name. The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus, Velocitus tremenjus, Birdibus zippibus, Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius. Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius, Eatius birdius, Overconfidentii vulgaris, Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex. \n The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons just like Tom and Jerry, but became popular in its own right.\n The Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: Operation: Rabbit, To Hare Is Human, Rabbit's Feat, Compressed Hare, and Hare-Breadth Hurry. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for Hare-Breadth Hurry), beginning with 1952's Operation: Rabbit, introducing himself as \"Wile E. Coyote\u2014Genius\", voiced with an upper-class accent by Mel Blanc. The Road Runner vocalizes only with a signature sound, \"Beep, Beep\", recorded by Paul Julian (although some viewers claim it sounds more like \"meep meep\"), and an accompanying \"popping-cork\" tongue noise.\n To date, 49 cartoons have been made featuring these characters (including the four CGI shorts), the majority by Chuck Jones.\n TV Guide included Wile E.
