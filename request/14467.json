In the mid 1930s, the state embarked on a program of removing dangerous grade crossings where major routes crossed railroad tracks. In 1938, it awarded a contract to S. M. Dixon to build an overpass at the crossing of US\u00a079 and the St. Louis Southwestern Railway line. Dixon built a 655-metre-long (2,149\u00a0ft) section of concrete roadway, 22 feet (6.7\u00a0m) wide, with a concrete deck girder bridge to cross the tracks. This section of US\u00a079 remained in service until 1954, when the current alignment to its northeast was built. It has since been designated County Road\u00a022.
