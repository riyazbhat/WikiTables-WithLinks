  "/wiki/Bullfighter": "A bullfighter is a performer in the art of bullfighting. \"Torero\" (Spanish: [to\u02c8\u027ee\u027eo]) or \"toureiro\" (Portuguese: [to\u02c8\u027e\u0250j\u027eu]) (both from Latin taurarius, bullfighter) are the Spanish and Portuguese words for bullfighter and describe all the performers in the sport of bullfighting as practised in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Peru, France, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and other countries influenced by Portuguese and Spanish culture. The main performer and leader of the entourage in a bullfight, and who finally kills the bull, is addressed as maestro (master), or with the formal title matador de toros (killer of bulls). The other bullfighters in the entourage are called subalternos and their suits are embroidered in silver as opposed to the matador's more-theatrical gold. They include the picadores, rejoneadores, and banderilleros. In English, a torero is sometimes referred to by the term toreador, which was popularized by Georges Bizet in his opera Carmen. In Spanish, the word designates bullfighters on horseback, but is little used today, having been almost entirely displaced by rejoneador. A very small number of women have been bullfighters on foot or on horseback; one recent example is Cristina S\u00e1nchez.",
