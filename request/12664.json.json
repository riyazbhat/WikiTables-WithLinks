The first step you have to take is index your files by creating the database. Once indexed, the file names can be searched rapidly.  It can't search the insides of files but searches for titles rapidly and reliably. \nIt was written by Janne Huttunen who indicated in September 2011 that it will no longer be actively maintained.

A benchmark as of January 2007 showed that Strigi is faster and uses less memory than other search systems, but it lacks many of their features[citation needed].  Like most desktop search systems, Strigi can extract information from files, such as the length of an audio clip, the contents of a document, or the resolution of a picture; plugins determine what filetypes it is capable of handling. Strigi uses its own Jstream system which allows for deep indexing of files. Strigi is accessible via Konqueror, or by clicking on its icon, after adding it to KDE's Kicker or GNOME Panel. (In GNOME desktop, it is called the Deskbar applet.) The graphical user interface (GUI) is named Strigiclient.",
