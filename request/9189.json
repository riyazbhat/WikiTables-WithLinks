This is one of the most famous accomplishments of the pioneer era of aviation, and not only won Bl\u00e9riot a lasting place in history but also assured the future of his aircraft manufacturing business.

  "/wiki/Gnome_Omega": "The Gnome 7 Omega (commonly called the Gnome 50\u00a0hp) is a French seven-cylinder, air-cooled aero engine produced by Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne. It was shown at the Paris Aero Salon held in December 1908 and was first flown in 1909. It was the world's first aviation  rotary engine produced in quantity. Its introduction revolutionized the aviation industry and it was used by many early aircraft. It produced 50\u00a0hp (37\u00a0kW) from its capacity of 8\u00a0l (490\u00a0cu\u00a0in). A Gnome Omega engine powers the 1912 Blackburn Monoplane, owned and operated by the Shuttleworth Collection, the oldest known airworthy British-designed aeroplane worldwide. A two-row version of the same engine was also produced, known as the Gnome 14 Omega-Omega or Gnome 100\u00a0hp.  The prototype Omega engine still exists, and is on display at the United States' National Air and Space Museum.",

It was a development of the racing monoplanes designed by L\u00e9on Morane and Raymond Saulnier after leaving Borel and, like its predecessors, was a wire-braced, shoulder-wing monoplane. Construction was of fabric-covered wood throughout, except for the undercarriage struts which were of steel tube.",

Its immediate effectiveness in this role launched an arms race in fighter development, and the Type L was swiftly rendered obsolete. The original Type L used wing warping for lateral control, but a later version designated Type LA was fitted with ailerons.",

The company became Sweden's first aircraft manufacturer. In 1920, Thulin also started manufacturing automobiles, which continued until 1928. During World War I, the company came into financial difficulties and was reconstructed in 1922 as AB Thulinverken. The manufacturing of brake systems became a main focus of the company. In 1958, Thulinverken merged with Svenska AB Bromsregulator (founded in 1913). The remains of Thulinverken are now a part of SAB Wabco AB, which is owned by the French Faiveley Transport company since 2004."
