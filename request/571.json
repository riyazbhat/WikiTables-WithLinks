  "/wiki/Atom_probe": "The atom probe was introduced at the 14th Field Emission Symposium in 1967 by Erwin Wilhelm M\u00fcller and J. A. Panitz. It combined a field ion microscope with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and, for the first time, an instrument could \u201c... determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observer\u201d.",
  "/wiki/Visible_spectrum": "The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 740 nanometers. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430\u2013770 THz.",
  "/wiki/Spectral_imaging": "Spectral imaging is imaging that uses multiple bands across the electromagnetic spectrum.  While an ordinary camera captures light across three wavelength bands in the visible spectrum, red, green, and blue (RGB), spectral imaging encompasses a wide variety of techniques that go beyond RGB.  Spectral imaging may use the infrared, the visible spectrum, the ultraviolet, x-rays, or some combination of the above.  It may include the acquisition of image data in visible and non-visible bands simultaneously, illumination from outside the visible range, or the use of optical filters to capture a specific spectral range.  It is also possible to capture hundreds of wavelength bands for each pixel in an image.",

  "/wiki/Laser_scanning_confocal_microscopy": "Confocal microscopy, most frequently confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) or laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM), is an optical imaging technique for increasing optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by means of using a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in image formation. Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within an object. This technique is used extensively in the scientific and industrial communities and typical applications are in life sciences, semiconductor inspection and materials science.",
  "/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_tomography": "Electron cryotomography (CryoET) is an imaging technique used to produce high-resolution (~1-4\u00a0nm) three-dimensional views of samples, typically biological macromolecules and cells. CryoET is a specialized application of transmission electron cryomicroscopy (CryoTEM) in which samples are imaged as they are tilted, resulting in a series of 2D images that can be combined to produce a 3D reconstruction, similar to a CT scan of the human body. In contrast to other electron tomography techniques, samples are immobilized in non-crystalline (\"vitreous\") ice and imaged under cryogenic conditions (< \u2212150\u00a0\u00b0C), allowing them to be imaged without dehydration or chemical fixation, which could otherwise disrupt or distort biological structures.",

Cryo-EM is gaining popularity in structural biology.",
  "/wiki/Electrical_capacitance_tomography": "Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a method for determination of the dielectric permittivity distribution in the interior of an object from external capacitance measurements. It is a close relative of electrical impedance tomography and is proposed as a method for industrial process monitoring, although it has yet to see widespread use. Potential applications include the measurement of flow of fluids in pipes and measurement of the concentration of one fluid in another, or the distribution of a solid in a fluid.",
  "/wiki/Electrical_capacitance": "Capacitance is the ratio of the change in electric charge of a system, to the corresponding change in its electric potential. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self capacitance and mutual capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three elementary linear electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).",
  "/wiki/Electrical_capacitance_volume_tomography": "Electrical capacitance volume tomography (ECVT) is a non-invasive 3D imaging technology applied primarily to multiphase flows. It was first introduced by W. Warsito, Q. Marashdeh, and L.-S. Fan as an extension of the conventional electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). In conventional ECT, sensor plates are distributed around a surface of interest. Measured capacitance between plate combinations is used to reconstruct 2D images (tomograms) of material distribution. In ECT, the fringing field from the edges of the plates is viewed as a source of distortion to the final reconstructed image and is thus mitigated by guard electrodes. ECVT exploits this fringing field and expands it through 3D sensor designs that deliberately establish an electric field variation in all three dimensions. The image reconstruction algorithms are similar in nature to ECT; nevertheless, the reconstruction problem in ECVT is more complicated. The sensitivity matrix of an ECVT sensor is more ill-conditioned and the overall reconstruction problem is more ill-posed compared to ECT. The ECVT approach to sensor design allows direct 3D imaging of the outrounded geometry. This is different than 3D-ECT that relies on stacking images from individual ECT sensors. 3D-ECT can also be accomplished by stacking frames from a sequence of time intervals of ECT measurements. Because the ECT sensor plates are required to have lengths on the order of the domain cross-section, 3D-ECT does not provide the required resolution in the axial dimension. ECVT solves this problem by going directly to the image reconstruction and avoiding the stacking approach. This is accomplished by using a sensor that is inherently three-dimensional.",
  "/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_tomography": "Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) or electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is a geophysical technique for imaging sub-surface structures from electrical resistivity measurements made at the surface, or by electrodes in one or more boreholes. If the electrodes are suspended in the boreholes, deeper sections can be investigated. It is closely related to the medical imaging technique electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and mathematically is the same inverse problem. In contrast to medical EIT, however, ERT is essentially a direct current method. A related geophysical method, induced polarization (or spectral induced polarization), measures the transient response and aims to determine the subsurface chargeability properties.",
  "/wiki/Electrical_resistivity": "Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity) and its inverse, electrical conductivity, is a fundamental property of  a material that quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter \u03c1 (rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter (\u03a9\u22c5m).  For example, if a 1 m \u00d7 1 m \u00d7 1 m solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is 1\u00a0\u03a9, then the resistivity of the material is 1\u00a0\u03a9\u22c5m.",
  "/wiki/Electrical_impedance_tomography": "Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive type of medical imaging in which the electrical conductivity, permittivity, and impedance of a part of the body is inferred from surface electrode measurements and used to form a tomographic image of that part. Electrical conductivity varies considerably among various biological tissues (absolute EIT) or the movement of fluids and gases within tissues (difference EIT). The majority of EIT systems apply small alternating currents at a single frequency, however, some EIT systems use multiple frequencies to better differentiate between normal and suspected abnormal tissue within the same organ (multifrequency-EIT or electrical impedance spectroscopy).",

This information is collected and used to assemble a three-dimensional image of the target. For biological applications, the typical resolution of ET systems are in the 5\u201320 nm range, suitable for examining supra-molecular multi-protein structures, although not the secondary and tertiary structure of an individual protein or polypeptide.",
  "/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, an abbreviation which can also stand for the instrument, a transmission electron microscope) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100\u00a0nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a scintillator attached to a charge-coupled device.",
  "/wiki/Focal_plane_tomography": "In radiography, focal plane tomography is tomography (imaging a single plane, or slice, of an object) by simultaneously moving the X-ray generator and X-ray detector so as to keep a consistent exposure of only the plane of interest during image acquisition. This was the main method of obtaining tomographs in medical imaging until the late-1970s. It has since been largely replaced by more advanced imaging techniques such as CT and MRI. It remains in use today in a few specialized applications, such as for acquiring orthopantomographs of the jaw in dental radiography.",

X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to as R\u00f6ntgen radiation, after the German scientist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who discovered it on November 8, 1895. He named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of X-ray(s) in the English language includes the variants x-ray(s), xray(s), and X ray(s).",

This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases.",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a method of physical observation in which nuclei in a strong constant magnetic field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field (in the near field and therefore not involving electromagnetic waves) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus. This process occurs near resonance, when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei, which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field, the chemical environment, and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca. 20\u00a0 tesla, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts (60\u20131000\u00a0MHz). NMR results from specific magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study molecular physics, crystals as well as non-crystalline materials. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",
  "/wiki/Hydraulic_tomography": "Hydraulic tomography (HT) is a sequential cross-hole hydraulic test followed by inversion of all the data to map the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic properties. Specifically, HT involves installation of multiple wells in an aquifer, which are partitioned into several intervals along the depth using packers. A sequential aquifer test at selected intervals is then conducted. During the test, water is injected or withdrawn (i.e. a pressure excitation) at a selected interval in a given well. Pressure responses of the subsurface are then monitored at other intervals at this well and also in other wells. This test produces a set of pressure excitation/response data of the subsurface.",

  "/wiki/Laser_ablation": "Laser ablation or photoablation is the process of removing material from a solid (or occasionally liquid) surface by irradiating it with a laser beam.  At low laser flux, the material is heated by the absorbed laser energy and evaporates or sublimates.  At high laser flux, the material is typically converted to a plasma.  Usually, laser ablation refers to removing material with a pulsed laser, but it is possible to ablate material with a continuous wave laser beam if the laser intensity is high enough.

  "/wiki/Muon_tomography": "Muon tomography is a technique that uses cosmic ray muons to generate three-dimensional images of volumes using information contained in the Coulomb scattering of the muons. Since muons are much more deeply penetrating than X-rays, muon tomography can be used to image through much thicker material than x-ray based tomography such as CT scanning. The muon flux at the Earth's surface is such that a single muon passes through an area the size of a human hand per second.\nSince its development in the 1950s, muon tomography has taken many forms, the most important of which are muon transmission radiography and muon scattering tomography.
