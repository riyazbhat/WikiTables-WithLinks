He was the eldest son of Date Masamune, born in 1591 by Shinzo no Kata (a concubine). Coming of age while living with Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he received a character from Hideyoshi's name and took the adult name of Hidemune. Hideyoshi also granted him the court rank of junior 5th, lower grade (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b, ju go-i no ge) and the title of ji-j\u016b, appointing the young Hidemune as a page to his own son Toyotomi Hideyori. After Hideyoshi's death in 1600, he was made a hostage at the residence of Ukita Hideie. Though he was Masamune's eldest son, Hidemune was born by a concubine, and therefore could not be the successor to the Sendai Domain, which his father ruled. Masamune therefore considered the possibility of having Hidemune start a branch family. This was made possible in 1614, when father and son took part in the Osaka Campaign: Hidemune received the 100,000 koku Uwajima Domain which Tokugawa Ieyasu granted to Masamune.",
