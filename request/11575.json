  "/wiki/Ben_Nevis": "Ben Nevis (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Nibheis, pronounced\u00a0[pe\u02c8\u0272iv\u0259\u0283]; English: /b\u025bn\u02c8n\u025bv\u026as/) is the highest mountain in the British Isles. Standing at 1,345 metres (4,411\u00a0ft) above sea level, it is at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands, close to the town of Fort William.\n The mountain is a popular destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year, around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from Glen Nevis.\nThe 700-metre (2,300\u00a0ft) cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland, providing classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties for climbers and mountaineers. They are also the principal locations in Scotland for ice climbing.\n The summit, which is the collapsed dome of an ancient volcano, features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to invent the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory.",
  "/wiki/Aberdeenshire_(historic)": "Aberdeenshire or the County of Aberdeen (Scots: Coontie o Aiberdeen, Scottish Gaelic: Siorrachd Obar Dheathain) is a historic county and registration county of Scotland. The area of the county, excluding the city of Aberdeen itself, is also a lieutenancy area. The county borders Kincardineshire, Angus and Perthshire to the south, Inverness-shire and Banffshire to the west, and the North Sea to the north and east. It has a coast-line of 65 miles (105\u00a0km).\n Between 1890 and 1975, Aberdeenshire was one of the administrative counties of Scotland, governed by a county council. In 1900, the county town of Aberdeen became a county of a city and was thus removed from the administrative county. In 1975 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 reorganised local administration in Scotland into a two-tier system of regions and districts. The administrative counties of Aberdeenshire, the City of Aberdeen, Banffshire, Kincardineshire and most of Morayshire were merged to form Grampian Region, with the area of county being divided between the districts of City of Aberdeen, Banff and Buchan, Gordon and Kincardine and Deeside for administration. In 1996 Scottish local government system was reorganised a second time to form a single tier of unitary council areas. The name was revived in local government for the council area of Aberdeenshire, which has vastly different boundaries.\n The area is generally hilly, and from the south-west, near the centre of Scotland, the Grampians send out various branches, mostly to the north-east.",
  "/wiki/Ben_Macdhui_(Scotland)": "Ben Macdui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mac Duibh) is the second highest mountain in the United Kingdom (in absolute height) after Ben Nevis, and the highest in the Cairngorms National Park. After the defeat of Domnall mac Uilliam in 1187, Donnchad II, Earl of Fife, acquired Strathavon, a territory stretching from Ballindalloch to Ben Macdui; because the mountain marked the western boundary of Donnchad's territory, historian and place-name scholar Professor G.W.S. Barrow has suggested that the mountain took its name from Donnchad's family, the Mac Duibh.\n Ben Macdui lies on the southern edge of the Cairn Gorm plateau, on the boundary between Aberdeenshire and Moray.\n Probably the easiest route of ascent is from the Coire Cas car park at the foot of Cairngorm Ski Centre by a path that leads up over slowly rising moorland. This route is about 7\u00a0km (4\u00a0mi) long; a somewhat longer route allows one also to climb Cairn Gorm. One possible alternative route follows the path coming up from Loch Etchachan. This loch may be reached from Loch Avon to the north or by coming up from Glen Derry to the south. Other routes include coming over Derry Cairngorm, or via the Lairig Ghru pass, which lies to the west of Ben Macdui.\n Nearly all these routes are long days by Scottish standards.[clarification needed] When coming from the south it is common to use a bicycle to cover the 5\u00a0km (3\u00bd\u00a0mi) from the road end at Linn of Dee to Derry Lodge at the southern end of the massif.\n Before the production of accurate maps of Scotland in the 19th century it was not known for certain that Ben Nevis was the highest point in Britain, and it was often thought that Ben Macdui might be the higher. After Ben Nevis was confirmed as the higher some locals planned to build a cairn on the top of Ben Macdui to make its height greater than Ben Nevis, but these plans did not come to fruition. The summit of the mountain has a direction indicator erected in 1925 by the Cairngorm Club of Aberdeen in memory of a past president, Mr Alexander Copland. The indicator shows the directions of the most important hills that can be seen from the summit in clear weather.\n Snow patches have been known to persist at various locations on Ben Macdui, most notably Garbh Uisge Beag.\n After she had climbed to the top of Ben Macdui on 7 October 1859, aged forty, Queen Victoria wrote: \"It had a sublime and solemn effect, so wild, so solitary \u2013 no one but ourselves and our little party there\u00a0...

  "/wiki/Ben_Lawers": "Ben Lawers (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Labhair) is the highest mountain in the southern part of the Scottish Highlands. It lies to the north of Loch Tay, and is the highest point of a long ridge that includes seven Munros. It is the highest peak in Perthshire, and is the tenth highest Munro in Scotland. Ben Lawers was long thought to be over 4,000 feet (1,219.2\u00a0m) in height; accurate measurement in the 1870s showed it to be some 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m) short of this figure.\n Ben Lawers lies on the watershed between the rivers Tay and Lyon. Since the 1950s, water has been captured from the numerous burns on the south face of Ben Lawers and Meall nan Tarmachan as part of the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Scheme. The water is diverted to the Lochan na Lairige, from where it is piped to drive hydro-electric turbines at Finlarig on the banks of Loch Tay. The level of the Lochan na Lairige was raised by the construction of the 344\u00a0metre-long Lawers Dam, a buttress-type dam that is 42\u00a0m high. Due to the height of this reservoir the static head of water is 415\u00a0m, the highest available on any hydro-electric scheme in Scotland.\n Due to its high altitude and underlying geology Ben Lawers is home to an exceptionally rich selection of arctic-alpine plant species and habitats, and has been designated as a National Nature Reserve (NNR) since 1964.",

There is a registration county and a lieutenancy area in current use, the latter of which is 8,019 square kilometres (3,096 square miles) in extent. Historically there has also been a constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (1832 to 1983), a local government county (1890 to 1975), a district of the Highland local government region (1975 to 1996) and a management area of the Highland Council (1996 to 2007). The local government county is now divided between two local government areas: the Highland area and Na h-Eileanan Siar (the Western Isles). Ross and Cromarty border Sutherland to the north and Inverness-shire to the south.\n The county was formed by the uniting of the shires of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire. Both these shires had themselves been formed from the historic province of Ross, out of which the many enclaves and exclaves that formed Cromartyshire were carved out, leaving the remaining area to become Ross-shire. These parcels of land were for many purposes administered as part of Ross-shire rather than Cromartyshire. The county also included the Isle of Lewis, however this is not part of the modern lieutenancy area (which instead includes the Isle of Skye), although Lewis is part of the current registration county.",

Its area corresponds with most of the modern council area of Argyll and Bute, excluding the Isle of Bute and the Helensburgh area, but including the Morvern and Ardnamurchan areas of the Highland council area.\n There was an Argyllshire constituency of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 until 1983.",
  "/wiki/Bidean_nam_Bian": "Bidean nam Bian, lying to the south of Glen Coe, Highland, Scotland, is the highest point in the former county of Argyll. It is a complex mountain, with many ridges and subsidiary peaks, one of which, Stob Coire Sgreamhach, is classified as a separate Munro.\n The most noticeable features of Bidean nam Bian are the famous Three Sisters of Glen Coe, three  steeply-sided ridges that extend north into the Glen. Two of the sisters, Gearr Aonach (Short Ridge) and Aonach Dubh (Black Ridge) converge at Stob Coire nan Lochan, a 1,115\u00a0m (3,658 feet) subsidiary peak of Bidean nam Bian that lies about 1\u00a0km to the northeast of the actual summit. The final, most easterly sister, Beinn Fhada (Long Hill), joins the Bidean nam Bian massif at the summit of Stob Coire Sgreamhach.\n Beinn Fhada is separated from Gearr Aonach by a glen known as Coire Gabhail. This can translate to Glen of Capture, however the glen is more normally known as the Hidden or Lost Valley, as it has a wide flat area concealed from Glen Coe by the landslip which blocked the entrance and allowed a loch to form. The valley was used by Clan Macdonald to hide their livestock from raiders, or hide cattle they themselves had stolen. The steep rough path up from Glen Coe skirts a wooded ravine, and is a popular short walk (around 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) in total), though it involves a river crossing and some rocky sections.",

  "/wiki/Sutherland": "Sutherland is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area in the Highlands of Scotland. Its county town is Dornoch. Sutherland borders Caithness and Moray Firth to the east, Ross-shire and Cromartyshire (later combined into Ross and Cromarty) to the south and the Atlantic to the north and west. Like its southern neighbour Ross-shire, Sutherland has some of the most dramatic scenery in the whole of Europe, especially on its western fringe where the mountains meet the sea. These include high sea cliffs, and very old mountains composed of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks.\n The name Sutherland dates from the era of Norwegian Viking rule and settlement over much of the Highlands and Islands, under the rule of the jarl of Orkney. Although it contains some of the northernmost land in the island of Great Britain, it was called Su\u00f0rland (\"southern land\") from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness. In Gaelic, the area is referred to according to its traditional areas: D\u00f9thaich MhicAoidh (or D\u00f9thaich 'IcAoidh) in the northeast, Asainte (Assynt) in the west, and Cataibh in the east. Cataibh is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole. The northwest corner of Sutherland, traditionally known as the Province of Strathnaver, was not incorporated into Sutherland until 1601. This was the home of the powerful and warlike Clan Mackay, and as such was named in Gaelic, D\u00f9thaich 'Ic Aoidh, the Homeland of Mackay. Even today this part of Sutherland is known as Mackay Country, and, unlike other areas of Scotland where the names traditionally associated with the area have become diluted, there is still a preponderance of Mackays in the D\u00f9thaich.\n Much of the population is in coastal towns, such as Helmsdale and Lochinver, which until very recently made much of their living from the rich fishing of the waters around the British Isles. Much of Sutherland is poor relative to the rest of Scotland, with few job opportunities beyond government funded employment, agriculture and seasonal tourism. Further education is provided by North Highland College, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. The Ross House Campus in Dornoch was the first establishment in the United Kingdom to provide a degree in golf management. The Burghfield House Campus, also in Dornoch, is the home for the Centre for History teaching undergraduate and postgraduate history degrees to students around the UHI network and worldwide.",

These three islands are part of the County of Bute and are sometimes included when the term Ayrshire is applied to the region. The same area is known as Ayrshire and Arran in other contexts.",
  "/wiki/Kirriereoch_Hill": "Kirriereoch Hill is a hill in the Range of the Awful Hand in the Southern Uplands of southern Scotland. It lies on the border of the old counties of Ayrshire and Kirkcudbrightshire, or the modern regions of Dumfries and Galloway and South Ayrshire. Kirriereoch Hill was classified as a Corbett and Marilyn but then deleted from these lists in 1984 due to not being thought to achieve the respective prominence criteria.  \n In August 2015 the hill was re-listed as a Marilyn after having been surveyed to have a 150.2m prominence.  However, since this is less than the 152.4m required, the hill will not be re-listed as a Corbett.",
  "/wiki/Kincardineshire": "Kincardineshire, also known as the Mearns (from Scottish Gaelic: A' Mhaoirne meaning \"the Stewartry\"), is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area on the coast of northeast Scotland. It is bounded by Aberdeenshire on the north and west, and by Angus on the south.\n The name \"Kincardine\" is also used in Kincardine and Mearns, a committee area of the Aberdeenshire Council, although this covers a smaller area than the county.",
  "/wiki/Mount_Battock": "Mount Battock (778 m) is a mountain in the Mounth on the eastern edge of the Scottish Highlands, on the border between Aberdeenshire and Angus.\n A rounded peak, it is located on the northern side of Glen Esk, and is the most easterly Corbett, also making it the most easterly mountain in Scotland.

  "/wiki/Lanarkshire": "Lanarkshire, also called the County of Lanark (Scottish Gaelic: Siorrachd Lannraig, Scots: Lanrikshire) is a historic county in the central Lowlands of Scotland.\n Historically, Lanarkshire was the most populous county in Scotland, containing as it does most of Glasgow and the surrounding conurbation. In earlier times it had considerably greater boundaries, including neighbouring Renfrewshire until 1402. Lanarkshire is bounded to the north by Stirlingshire and Dunbartonshire (this boundary is split into two sections owing to Dunbartonshire's Cumbernauld exclave), to the northeast by West Lothian and Mid Lothian, to the east by Peeblesshire, to the south by Dumfriesshire, and to the west by Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.",
  "/wiki/Culter_Fell": "Culter Fell is a hill in the Southern Uplands of Scotland. It is the county top of the historic county of Lanarkshire, as well as the highest point in South Lanarkshire council area. It is the culmination of a network of ridges that lie south of the village of Coulter, close to the town of Biggar.\n It is probably most easily climbed from the north west. The best starting point is the mouth of Kings Beck, at NT 031305. Earlier OSGB topographic maps show a public road at this location, but the most recent maps show only a private road, and there are notices threatening to remove unauthorised vehicles. Cars should therefore be parked at Birthwood, 500 metres further back. It is tempting to walk up the track leading up the Kings Beck, but the direct route up the north west ridge is much easier. The slope is smooth and dry, the vegetation is short, and although there is no constructed footpath, helpful steps have been cut by the boots of previous climbers.\n There is an alternative starting point at Glenkirk, to the east (NT077295). From here, a circular route along a ridge including Chapelgill Hill is among several additional options.\n There is extensive sheep farming and sporting activity in the area, so care should be taken when accessing Culter Fell in the spring or late summer.\n From the summit, the view on a clear day stretches from the Cumbrian Lake District to the Scottish Highlands.",
  "/wiki/Roxburghshire": "Roxburghshire or the County of Roxburgh is a historic county and registration county in the Southern Uplands of Scotland. It borders Dumfriesshire to the west, Selkirkshire and Midlothian to the north-west, and Berwickshire to the north. To the south-west it borders Cumberland and to the south-east Northumberland, both in England.\n It was named after the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh, a town which declined markedly in the 15th century and is no longer in existence. Latterly, the county town of Roxburghshire was Jedburgh.\n The county has much the same area as Teviotdale, the basin drained by the River Teviot and tributaries together with the adjacent stretch of the Tweed into which it flows. The term is often treated as synonymous with Roxburghshire, but may omit Liddesdale as Liddel Water drains to the west coast.",
  "/wiki/Clackmannanshire": "Clackmannanshire (/kl\u00e6k\u02c8m\u00e6n\u0259n\u02cc\u0283\u026a\u0259r, -\u0283\u0259r/ (listen); Scottish Gaelic: Siorrachd Chlach Mhannainn) is a historic county and council area in Scotland, bordering the council areas of Stirling, Fife and Perth & Kinross and the historic counties of Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Fife.\n The name is derived from three languages the first Scottish Gaelic: Clach meaning \"Stone\", Mannan is a derivative of the Brythonic name of the Iron Age tribe the Manaw, who inhabited the area, and the English word shire.
