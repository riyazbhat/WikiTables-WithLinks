Owing to a 19th-century dispute, there are currently two Earls of Mar as both the first and seventh creations are currently extant. The first creation of the earldom was originally the provincial ruler of the province of Mar in north-eastern Scotland. First attested in the year 1014, the \"seat\" or \"caput\" eventually became Kildrummy Castle, although other sites like Doune of Invernochty were initially just as important.\n The title evolved into a peerage title, and was made particularly famous by John Erskine, the 23rd/6th Earl of Mar, who was an important Jacobite military leader during the 1715 Jacobite rising.\n Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar holds the title in the first creation, and James Erskine, 14th Earl of Mar and 16th Earl of Kellie in the seventh. The Earl of Mar and Kellie is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Erskine; the Countess of Mar is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Mar. The Earldom of Mar, which is one of the seven original Scottish earldoms, is thought to be the oldest peerage in Great Britain, and even Europe.\n The family seat of Earl of Mar (first creation) is St Michael's Farm, near Great Witley, Worcestershire, and of Earl of Mar (seventh creation) is Hilton Farm, near Alloa, Clackmannanshire.",

  "/wiki/Lord_Somerville": "Lord Somerville is a title in the Peerage of Scotland which is subject to a number of ambiguities. The date of creation is not known with certainty but it was probably created about 1435 for Thomas Somerville, Justiciar of Scotland. The title was omitted in 1606 when an ordered list of the Scottish peerage was produced following the union of the Scottish and English crowns, and the title was not used during the 17th century. In 1723, however, the House of Lords ratified and acknowledged the title for James Somerville the 13th Lord. The consecutive numbers ascribed to the numerous Lords differ according to which authority is consulted. The list below uses the numbers favoured by Burkes Peerage.\n The Somervilles claim descent from William de Somerville, given Carnwath by David I of Scotland in the 12th century.\n A family history was written by James Somerville, 11th Lord Somerville in 1679. He related that William the Lion made John Somerville, his falconer, baron of Linton in Roxburghshire for killing a monstrous worm in 1174. The Worm of Linton was three Scots yards long and coloured like an adder. After stalking the beast for several days, Sir John killed it with a long iron-clad lance with a Catherine wheel fitted near its point. From this exploit the Somervilles used a wyvern in their heraldry. The poet Blind Harry mentions the knighting of Walter Somerville of Newbigging and his son David at the battle of Biggar by Alexander III of Scotland.\n The later family seat at Drum House, Gilmerton, near Edinburgh was acquired as a result of the marriage of Sir Walter Somerville of Linton and Carnwath to the daughter and heiress of Sir John Herring. Carnwath was sold in the 16th century and Hugh Somerville, the 7th Lord, built a substantial tower house at Drum in 1585 which was replaced between 1726 and 1734 with a Palladian mansion designed by architect William Adam. The Drum estate was sold in 1862.\n The family's earliest known ancestor is Sir Gualter de Somerville (anglicized as Walter de Somerville), a Norman knight and companion of William the Conqueror who, for his service during the Norman conquest of England, was awarded the lordship of Whichnour, in Stafford, and the land that is now known as Aston Somerville, in Evesham. One of Gualter's sons, William de Somerville, was close to King David I of Scotland and, for their friendship, David created for him the barony of Carnwath in the county of Lanark. He also acquired the barony of Linton in Roxburghshire. William's descendants, like himself, were close to royalty, and they went onto marry into prominent Scottish families.",

  "/wiki/Earl_of_Atholl": "The Mormaer or Earl of Atholl was the title of the holder of a medieval comital lordship straddling the highland province of Atholl (Ath Fodhla), now in northern Perthshire. Atholl is a special Mormaerdom, because a King of Atholl is reported from the Pictish period. The only other two Pictish kingdoms to be known from contemporary sources are Fortriu and Circinn. Indeed, the early 13th century document known to modern scholars as the de Situ Albanie repeats the claim that Atholl was an ancient Pictish kingdom. In the 11th century, the famous Cr\u00edn\u00e1n of Dunkeld may have performed the role of Mormaer.\n Royal connections continued with M\u00e1el Muire, who was the son of King Donnchad I, and the younger brother of M\u00e1el Coluim III mac Donnchada. Matad was perhaps the most famous of the Mormaers, fathering Harald Maddadsson, a notorious rebel of the Scottish King and perhaps the first Gael to rule Orkney as Earl of Orkney. The line of M\u00e1el Muire and Cr\u00edn\u00e1n came to an end when Forbhlaith, the daughter of Mormaer Henry married David de Hastings.\n The latter marriage produced a daughter, Ada, who married into the Strathbogie family, a semi-Normanized Gaelic family with Fife origins.

In 1477, Lord Caithness wished to disinherit his eldest son from his first marriage to Lady Elizabeth Douglas, William Sinclair (d. 1487), who was known as \"The Waster\". Therefore, so that his earldom would not pass to him, he resigned the title in favour of his son from his second marriage to Marjory Sutherland, who was also named William Sinclair (d. 1513) (who became the second Earl of Caithness).

He was the son of Andrew St Clair, de jure 12th Lord Sinclair, grandson of Charles Sinclair, de jure 11th Lord Sinclair (d. 1755) and great-grandson of the aforementioned Matthew St Clair, uncle of the tenth Lord.
