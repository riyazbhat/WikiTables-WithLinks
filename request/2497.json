  "/wiki/Earl_of_Mar": "The title Mormaer or Earl of Mar has been created several times, all in the Peerage of Scotland. Owing to a 19th-century dispute, there are currently two Earls of Mar as both the first and seventh creations are currently extant. The first creation of the earldom was originally the provincial ruler of the province of Mar in north-eastern Scotland. First attested in the year 1014, the seat or caput eventually became Kildrummy Castle, although other sites like Doune of Invernochty were initially just as important. The title evolved into a peerage title, and was made particularly famous by John Erskine, the 23rd/6th Earl of Mar, who was an important Jacobite military leader during the 1715 Jacobite rising. Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar holds the title in the first creation, and James Erskine, 14th Earl of Mar and 16th Earl of Kellie in the seventh. The Earl of Mar and Kellie is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Erskine; the Countess of Mar is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Mar.

Atholl is a special Mormaerdom, because a King of Atholl is reported from the Pictish period. The only other two Pictish kingdoms to be known from contemporary sources are Fortriu and Circinn. Indeed, the early 13th century document known to modern scholars as the de Situ Albanie repeats the claim that Atholl was an ancient Pictish kingdom. In the 11th century, the famous Cr\u00edn\u00e1n of Dunkeld may have performed the role of Mormaer. Royal connections continued with M\u00e1el Muire, who was the son of King Donnchad I, and the younger brother of M\u00e1el Coluim III mac Donnchada.

Therefore, so that his earldom would not pass to him, he resigned the title in favour of his son from his second marriage to Marjory Sutherland, who was also named William Sinclair (d. 1513) (who became the second Earl of Caithness). However, Lord Caithness was succeeded in the lordship of Sinclair by his eldest son William Sinclair, 2nd Lord Sinclair. The latter's son Henry, the third Lord, was confirmed in the title in 1488. On the death of his great-great-great-grandson, the ninth Lord, the male line of the second Lord failed.",
