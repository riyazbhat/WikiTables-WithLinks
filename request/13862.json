In 1922, after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks' victory, the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s.

  "/wiki/Poland": "Poland (Polish: Polska [\u02c8p\u0254lska] (listen)), officially the Republic of Poland (Polish: Rzeczpospolita Polska[c] [\u0290\u025bt\u0361\u0282p\u0254\u02c8sp\u0254lita \u02c8p\u0254lska] (listen)), is a country located in Central Europe. It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres (120,733 sq mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With a population of nearly 38.5 million people, Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union. Poland's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw. Other major cities include Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Wroc\u0142aw, Pozna\u0144, Gda\u0144sk, and Szczecin. Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea, Lithuania, and Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west. The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years. Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse, with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain. However, it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name. The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin. This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest (over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe, with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe's first written national constitution, the Constitution of 3 May 1791.",

  "/wiki/Klaip\u0117da": "Klaip\u0117da (Lithuanian pronunciation: [\u02c8k\u026b\u0250\u026a\u02d1p\u02b2e\u02d0d\u0250], listen (help\u00b7info); German: Memel, Samogitian: Klaipieda, is a city in Lithuania on the Baltic Sea coast. It is the third largest city in Lithuania and the capital of Klaip\u0117da County. The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional importance of the usually ice-free Port of Klaip\u0117da at the mouth of the Akmena-Dan\u0117 River. It was controlled by successive German states until the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. As a result of the 1923 Klaip\u0117da Revolt it was annexed by Lithuania and has remained with Lithuania to this day, except between 1939 and 1945 when it returned to Germany following the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania and Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (between Germany and the Soviet Union). The population has shrunk from the city to its suburbs and the hinterland. The number of inhabitants of Klaip\u0117da city shrank from 207,100 in 1992 to 157,350 in 2014, but the urban zone of Klaip\u0117da expanded well into the suburbs, which sprang around the city and surrounded it from three sides. These are well integrated with the city (city bus lines, city water supply, etc.) and the majority of inhabitants of these suburbs work in Klaip\u0117da. According to statistics of Klaip\u0117da territorial health insurance fund, there are 233,311 permanent inhabitants (as of 2019) in Klaip\u0117da city and Klaip\u0117da district municipalities combined.
