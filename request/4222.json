  "/wiki/Acrobatic_gymnastics": "Acrobatic gymnastics is a competitive gymnastic discipline where partnerships of gymnasts work together and perform figures consisting of acrobatic moves, dance and tumbling, set to music. There are three types of routines; a 'balance' routine (at FIG grade 5 and above) where the focus is on strength, poise and flexibility; a 'dynamic' routine (also FIG grade 5 and above) which includes throws, somersaults and catches, and (at FIG grade 6 and above, as well as grade 4 and below) a 'combined' routine which includes elements from both balance and dynamic. The sport is governed by the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG). At international level, there are four FIG categories of competition defined by age; 11-16, 12-18, 13-19, and 15+ (Senior). As well as this there is grades 1-6, grade 5 is the same difficulty as 11-16 and grade 6 is the same difficulty as 12-18. Acrobatic gymnasts perform in pairs or groups and enter into and are judged at a specific level or age group category. In each partnership, the gymnasts' different sizes and abilities will be balanced to complement each other in order to carry out the complex moves. Some will mainly carry out supporting and pitching roles, and are known as bases.",

Events exist over distances similar to swimming competitions for both swimming pool and open water venues. Competition at world and continental level is organised by the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques (CMAS). The sport's first world championship was held in 1976.

  "/wiki/Powerlifting": "Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as odd lifts, which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three. In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as 'raw' lifting or 'classic' in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting. Weight belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting.",
