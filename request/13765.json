In biochemistry, it is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.\n More than two million tons of citric acid are manufactured every year. It is used widely as an acidifier, as a flavoring and a chelating agent.\n A citrate is a derivative of citric acid; that is, the salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion found in solution. An example of the former, a salt is trisodium citrate; an ester is triethyl citrate. When part of a salt, the formula of the citrate ion is written as C6H5O3\u22127 or C3H5O(COO)3\u22123.",

All cephalopods, with the exception of the Nautilidae and the Cirrina (deep-sea octopuses), are able to release ink.\n The ink is released from the ink sacs (located between the gills) and is dispersed more widely when its release is accompanied by a jet of water from the siphon. Its dark colour is caused by its main constituent, melanin. Each species of cephalopod produces slightly differently coloured inks; generally, octopuses produce black ink, squid ink is blue-black, and cuttlefish ink is a shade of brown.\n A number of other aquatic molluscs have similar responses to attack, including the gastropod clade known as sea hares.",

Bloaters are sometimes called Yarmouth bloater, or, jokingly, as a Yarmouth capon, two-eyed steak, or Billingsgate pheasant (after the Billingsgate Fish Market in London). Bloaters are distinct from kippers in that bloaters are cured whole herring, while kippers are split smoked herring.

  "/wiki/English_cuisine": "English cuisine encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from the Americas, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration. Some traditional meals, such as bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled vegetables and broths, and freshwater and saltwater fish have ancient origins. The 14th-century English cookbook, the Forme of Cury,[a] contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II. English cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the Middle Ages. Curry was introduced from the Indian subcontinent and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with Hannah Glasse's recipe for chicken currey. French cuisine influenced English recipes throughout the Victorian era.

Salt is essential for life in general, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation. Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians.

However, some traditional events of the Japanese New Year are partially celebrated on the first day of the year on the modern Tenp\u014d calendar, the last official lunisolar calendar which was used until 1872 in Japan.",
  "/wiki/Sushi": "Sushi (\u3059\u3057, \u5bff\u53f8, \u9ba8, pronounced [s\u026f\u0325\u0255i\ua71c] or [s\u026f\u0325\ua71c\u0255i]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (\u9ba8\u98ef, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (\u30cd\u30bf, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is sushi rice, also referred to as shari (\u3057\u3083\u308a), or sumeshi (\u9162\u98ef).\n Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon  (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.\n Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.",
  "/wiki/Chinmi": "Chinmi (\u73cd\u5473) is a Japanese term meaning literally rare taste, but more appropriately delicacy.  They are local cuisines that have fallen out of popularity or those cuisines that are peculiar to a certain area.  Many involve pickled seafood.",

  "/wiki/Swedish_cuisine": "Swedish cuisine is the traditional food of the people of Sweden. Due to Sweden's large north-to-south expanse, there are regional differences between the cuisine of North and South Sweden.\n Historically, in the far north, meats such as reindeer, and other (semi-)game dishes were eaten, some of which have their roots in the Sami culture, while fresh vegetables have played a larger role in the South. Many traditional dishes employ simple, contrasting flavours, such as the traditional dish of meatballs and brown cream sauce with tart, pungent lingonberry jam (slightly similar in taste to cranberry sauce).\n Swedes have traditionally been very open to foreign influences, ranging from French cuisine during the 17th and 18th centuries, to the sushi and caff\u00e9 latte of today.",

  "/wiki/Solomon_Gundy": "Solomon Gundy is a Jamaican pickled (with salt) fish p\u00e2t\u00e9 usually served with crackers as an appetizer. Solomon Gundy is also a popular cuisine from Nova Scotia, consisting of pickled herring and onions also served with crackers, typically as an appetizer or a snack.  \n The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is made with smoked red herring (although other fish such as mackerel and shad are also sometimes used) and is minced and spiced with chili peppers and seasonings. The dish appears on the menus of Jamaican restaurants and resorts. It is also sold as a packaged food for export.\n The term may come from the British word salmagundi, used to refer to a salad of many different ingredients. That term is originally from the French word salmigondis, which refers to a disparate assembly of things, ideas or people, forming an incoherent whole (a hodgepodge).",
  "/wiki/Jamaican_cuisine": "Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavours, spices and influences from the indigenous people on the island of Jamaica, and the Spanish, Irish, British, African, Indian and Chinese who have inhabited the island. It is also influenced by the crops introduced into the island from tropical Southeast Asia. Jamaican cuisine includes various dishes from the different cultures brought to the island with the arrival of people from elsewhere. Other dishes are novel or a fusion of techniques and traditions. In addition to ingredients that are native to Jamaica, many foods have been introduced and are now grown locally. A wide variety of seafood, tropical fruits and meats are available. Some Jamaican cuisine dishes are variations on the cuisines and cooking styles brought to the island from elsewhere. These are often modified to incorporate local produce.",
  "/wiki/Herring_as_food": "Herring are forage fish in the wild, mostly belonging to the family Clupeidae, but they are also an important food for humans. Herring often move in large schools around fishing banks and near the coast. The most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus Clupea, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, including the Baltic Sea, as well as off the west coast of South America. Three species of Clupea are recognized; the main taxon, the Atlantic herring, accounts for over half the world's commercial capture of herrings.\n Herrings played a pivotal role in the history of marine fisheries in Europe, and early in the twentieth century, their study was fundamental to the evolution of fisheries science. These oily fish also have a long history as an important food fish, and are often salted, smoked, or pickled."
