The event was only open to men and bouts were contested over four rounds of two minutes each. Five judges scored the fighters in real time and the boxer with the most points at the end was the winner.\n Three days before the Games opening ceremony the International Olympic Committee announced that Kenyan boxer David Munyasia had tested positive for cathine and has been excluded from the event.\n Several medalists at the 2004 Olympics, including Amir Khan, Andre Ward, Gennady Golovkin, Yuriorkis Gamboa, and Guillermo Rigondeaux, later went on to become world champions in professional boxing. However, Russian boxers don\u2019t typically turn pro as their government provides them with extensive funding which allows them to keep their \u201camateur\u201d status and compete at multiple Olympics. The tournament was also Mario Kindel\u00e1n's final Olympic event before retirement, with a second lightweight gold metal after beating Amir Khan.",

  "/wiki/Romania_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics": "Romania competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Romanian athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games since its official debut in 1924, missing only two editions, including the 1948 Summer Olympics. The Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee (Romanian: Comitetul Olimpic \u0219i Sportiv Rom\u00e2n, COSR) sent the nation's smallest team to the Games since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. A total of 108 athletes, 50 men and 58 women, had competed in 16 different sports, most notably in artistic gymnastics and rowing. For the third time in Olympic history, Romania was again represented by more female than male athletes.\n The Romanian team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney four years earlier, including coxless rowing pair Monica Ro\u015fu and Viorica Susanu, sprint canoeists Florin Popescu and Mitic\u0103 Pricop, gymnastics champion Marius Urzic\u0103 in men's pommel horse, and rowers Doina Ignat and Georgeta Andrunache. Pistol shooter and 1988 Olympic champion Sorin Babii, and rowing legend Elisabeta Lip\u0103, who won a total of seven Olympic medals in her illustrious sporting career, became the first Romanian athletes to compete in six Olympic Games. Having received the second most medals by a single athlete in the nation's Olympic history, Lipa reprised her role to carry the Romanian flag in the opening ceremony for the second consecutive time.\n Despite being the smallest team to the Games since 1988, Romania left Athens with a total of 19 Olympic medals, 8 golds, 5 silver, and 6 bronze, failing only three golds short of the total achieved in Sydney. Most of these medals were awarded to the athletes in artistic gymnastics and rowing, including three prestigious Olympic titles from C\u0103t\u0103lina Ponor in women's floor, balance beam, and team all-around exercises. Apart from Ponor's Olympic glory, the nation's highlight of the Games also came with a powerful triumph of the rowing team, as the Romanians managed to secure their title in the women's eight. With a stark tally of eight medals, Lipa greatly emerged as the most successful female rower in the entire Olympic history after winning her fourth consecutive gold and fifth overall within a record span of 20 years."
