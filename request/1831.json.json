It existed from the 8th century up to c. 969-971 and was ruled by the Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty. Its first ruler known by name was Vi\u0161eslav who started ruling around 780. In 822, the Serbs were said to rule the \"greater part of Dalmatia\", while by that time, starting from the year 681, the Bulgarian state had taken the lands to the east, preparing to conquer Serbia. Vlastimir defeated the Bulgarian army in a three-year-war (839\u2013842), and the two powers lived in peace for some decades. Vlastimir's three sons succeeded in ruling Serbia together, although not for long; Serbia became a key part in the power struggle between the Byzantines and Bulgarians (in predominantly Byzantine alliance), which also resulted in major dynastic wars for a period of three decades. Central parts of the principality were shortly occupied by the Bulgarian army for three years (924\u2013927), until Serbian prince \u010caslav succeeded to liberate the land and unite several Serbian regions, becoming the most powerful ruler of the Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty. An important process during this period was the Christianization of the Serbs, the establishment of Christianity as state-religion c. 869, and the founding of the first Serbian eparchy (diocese), the Eparchy of Ras. The principality was annexed by the Byzantines in c. 969-971 and ruled as the Catepanate of Ras. The main information of the history of the principality and Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty are recorded in the contemporary historical work De Administrando Imperio (written c. 950\u2013960).",

First mentioned in 10th\u2013 and 11th century Byzantine chronicles, it was a vassal of the Byzantine Empire until it became independent in 1040 under Stefan Vojislav (fl. 1034\u201343) who rose up and managed to take over territories of the earlier Serbian Principality, founding the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty. Between 1043 and 1080, under Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107 (r.\u00a0 1050\u201381), and his son, Constantine Bodin (r.\u00a0 1081\u20131101), Duklja saw its apogee. Mihailo was given the nominal title King of Slavs by the Pope after having left the Byzantine camp and supported an uprising in the Balkans, in which his son Bodin played a central part. Having incorporated the Serbian hinterland (the core of the earlier Serbian Principality, known as Ra\u0161ka) and installed vassal rulers there, this maritime principality emerged as the most powerful Serb polity, seen in the titles used by its rulers (\"Prince of Serbia\", \"of Serbs\"). However, its rise was short-lived, as Bodin was defeated by the Byzantines and imprisoned; pushed to the background, his relative and vassal Vukan became independent in Ra\u0161ka, which continued the fight against the Byzantines while Duklja was struck with civil wars. Between 1113 and 1149 Duklja was the centre of Serbian\u2013Byzantine conflict, with members of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of either fighting each other for power. Duklja was then incorporated as a crown land of the Grand Principality of Serbia ruled by the Vukanovi\u0107 dynasty, subsequently known as Zeta, remaining so until the fall of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century.",

Its founder, Vukan, took the title of Grand Prince when his uncle and overlord Constantine Bodin ended up in Byzantine prison after decades of revolt.
