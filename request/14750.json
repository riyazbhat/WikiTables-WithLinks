  "/wiki/Glycine": "Glycine (symbol Gly or G; /\u02c8\u0261la\u026asi\u02d0n/) is an amino acid that has a single hydrogen atom as its side chain. It is the simplest amino acid (since carbamic acid is unstable), with the chemical formula NH2\u2010CH2\u2010COOH. Glycine is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is encoded by all the codons starting with GG (GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG). Glycine is integral to the formation of alpha-helices in secondary protein structure due to its compact form. For the same reason, it is the most abundant amino acid in collagen triple-helices. Glycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter - interference with its release within the spinal cord (such as during a Clostridium tetani infection) can cause spastic paralysis due to uninhibited muscle contraction.\n Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. It can fit into hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments, due to its minimal side chain of only one hydrogen atom.  The acyl radical is glycyl.",

It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it from the non-essential amino acid L-glutamate. It is encoded by all the codons starting with CC (CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG).\n Proline is the only proteinogenic amino acid with a secondary amine, in that the alpha-amino group is attached directly to the main  chain, making the \u03b1 carbon a direct substituent of the side chain.",
  "/wiki/Alanine": "Alanine (symbol Ala or A) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain.  Consequently, its IUPAC systematic name is 2-aminopropanoic acid, and it is classified as a nonpolar, aliphatic \u03b1-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as \u2212NH3+) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as \u2212CO2\u2212).  It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesised metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet. It is encoded by all codons starting with GC (GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG).\n The L-isomer of alanine (left-handed) is the one that is incorporated into proteins. L-Alanine is second only to leucine in rate of occurrence, accounting for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins. The right-handed form, D-alanine, occurs in polypeptides in some bacterial cell walls:131 and in some peptide antibiotics, and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte.",

  "/wiki/Glutamic_acid": "Glutamic acid (symbol Glu or E) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used by almost all living beings in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. It is also an excitatory neurotransmitter, in fact the most abundant one, in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABA-ergic neurons.\n It has a formula C5H9O4N. Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC-CH(NH2)-(CH2)2-COOH, with two carboxyl groups -COOH and one amino group -NH2.  However, in the solid state and mildly acid water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure \u2212OOC-CH(NH+3)-(CH2)2-COOH. It is encoded by the codons GAA or GAG.\n The acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate base, the singly-negative anion glutamate \u2212OOC-CH(NH+3)-(CH2)2-COO\u2212.  This form of the compound is prevalent in neutral solutions. The glutamate neurotransmitter plays the principal role in neural activation.  This anion is also responsible for the savory flavor (umami) of certain foods, and used in glutamate flavorings such as MSG. In Europe it is classified as food additive E620. In highly alkaline solutions the doubly negative anion \u2212OOC-CH(NH2)-(CH2)2-COO\u2212 prevails. The radical corresponding to glutamate is called glutamyl.",

It contains an \u03b1-amino group, an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain consisting of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain ending in a guanidino group. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (\u2212COO\u2212), the amino group is protonated (\u2212NH3+), and the guanidino group is also protonated to give the guanidinium form (-C-(NH2)2+), making arginine a charged, aliphatic amino acid. It is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG.\n Arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize or create arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people do not need to supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline.",
  "/wiki/Aspartic_acid": "Aspartic acid (symbol Asp or D; the ionic form is known as aspartate), is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Similar to all other amino acids, it contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its \u03b1-amino group is in the protonated \u2013NH+3 form under physiological conditions, while its \u03b1-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH2COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, \u2212COO\u2212. It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed. It is encoded by the codons GAU and GAC.\n D-Aspartate is one of two D-amino acids commonly found in mammals.\n In proteins aspartate sidechains are often hydrogen bonded to form asx turns or asx motifs, which frequently occur at the N-termini of alpha helices.\n The L-isomer of Asp is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins. Aspartic acid, like glutamic acid, is classified as an acidic amino acid, with a pKa of 3.9, however in a peptide this is highly dependent on the local environment, and could be as high as 14. Asp is pervasive in biosynthesis. Because aspartate can be synthesized by the body it is classified as a non-essential amino acid.",

It is encoded by the codons, AAA and AAG. Like almost all other amino acids, the \u03b1-carbon is chiral and lysine may refer to either enantiomer or a racemic mixture of both. For the purpose of this article, lysine will refer to the biologically active enantiomer L-lysine, where the \u03b1-carbon is in the S configuration.\n The human body cannot synthesize lysine.  It is essential in humans and must be obtained from the diet. In organisms that synthesise lysine, it has two main biosynthetic pathways, the diaminopimelate and \u03b1-aminoadipate pathways, which employ different enzymes and substrates and are found in different organisms. Lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways, the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway.\n Lysine plays several roles in humans, most importantly proteinogenesis, but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides, uptake of essential mineral nutrients, and in the production of carnitine, which is key in fatty acid metabolism. Lysine is also often involved in histone modifications, and thus, impacts the epigenome. The \u03b5-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding and as a general base in catalysis. The \u03b5-ammonium group (NH3+) is attached to the fourth carbon from the \u03b1-carbon, which is attached to the carboxyl (C=OOH) group.\n Due to its importance in several biological processes, a lack of lysine can lead to several disease states including defective connective tissues, impaired fatty acid metabolism, anaemia, and systemic protein-energy deficiency. In contrast, an overabundance of lysine, caused by ineffective catabolism, can cause severe neurological issues.\n Lysine was first isolated by the German biological chemist Ferdinand Heinrich Edmund Drechsel in 1889 from the protein casein in milk. He named it \"lysin\". In 1902, the German chemists Emil Fischer and Fritz Weigert determined lysine's chemical structure by synthesizing it.",

It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, and beans and other legumes. It is encoded by the codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG.\n Like valine and isoleucine, leucine is a branched-chain amino acid. The primary metabolic end products of leucine metabolism are acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; consequently, it is one of the two exclusively ketogenic amino acids, with lysine being the other. It is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans.\n Leucine and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyric acid, a minor leucine metabolite, exhibit pharmacological activity in humans and have been demonstrated to promote protein biosynthesis via the phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR).",

It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins, coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the skin pigment melanin. It is encoded by the codons UUU and UUC.\n Phenylalanine is found naturally in the breast milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed analgesic and antidepressant effects.  It is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine, a commonly used dietary supplement.

The thiol is susceptible to oxidation to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920.  It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC.\n Cysteine has the same structure as serine, but with one of its oxygen atoms replaced by sulfur; replacing it with selenium gives selenocysteine. Like other natural proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine has l chirality in the older d/l notation based on homology to d- and l-glyceraldehyde.  In the newer R/S system of designating chirality, based on the atomic numbers of atoms near the asymmetric carbon, cysteine (and selenocysteine) have R chirality, because of the presence of sulfur (or selenium) as a second neighbor to the asymmetric carbon.

Collagen consists of amino acids bound together to form a triple helix of elongated fibril known as a collagen helix. It is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and skin.\n Depending upon the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be rigid (bone), compliant (tendon), or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). It is also abundant in corneas, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous, muscles. The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen. Gelatin, which is used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed. Collagen has many medical uses in treating complications of the bones and skin.\n The name collagen comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 (k\u00f3lla), meaning \"glue\", and suffix -\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd, -gen, denoting \"producing\".
