  "/wiki/Writer": "A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The term writer is also used elsewhere in the arts \u2013 such as songwriter \u2013 but as a standalone writer normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media \u2013 for example, graphics or illustration \u2013 to enhance the communication of their ideas.",
  "/wiki/Illustrator": "An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books.\n Illustration is the art of making images that work with something and add to it without needing direct attention and without distracting from what they illustrate. The other thing is the focus of the attention, and the illustration's role is to add personality and character without competing with that other thing.\n Illustrations have been used in advertisements, architectural rendering, greeting cards, posters, books, graphic novels, storyboards, business, technical communications, magazines, shirts, video games, tutorials, and newspapers. A cartoon illustration can add humor to stories or essays.",

  "/wiki/Brothers_Grimm": "The Brothers Grimm (die Br\u00fcder Grimm or die Gebr\u00fcder Grimm), Jacob Ludwig Karl (1785\u20131863) and Wilhelm Carl (1786\u20131859), were German academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together collected and published folklore during the 19th century. They were among the first and best-known collectors of German and European folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as Cinderella (Aschenputtel), The Frog Prince (Der Froschk\u00f6nig), The Goose-Girl (Die G\u00e4nsemagd), Hansel and Gretel (H\u00e4nsel und Gretel), Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin (Rumpelstilzchen), Sleeping Beauty (Dornr\u00f6schen), and Snow White (Schneewittchen). Their classic collection, Children's and Household Tales (Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen), was published in two volumes\u2014the first in 1812 and the second in 1815. The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in the nearby town of Steinau. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished  the family and affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to researching the early history of German language and literature, including German folktales. The rise of Romanticism during the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies.",
