Inclusion in the Kangaroos register denotes a player's selection for a Kangaroos squad and does not necessarily mean an actual full international appearance was made. The year selected represents the first year in which they were called up for international duties and the appearances represent full international matches. New Zealand players who were selected to play for 'Australasian' representative teams are also included.

It is regularly described as being the pinnacle of rugby league, even in comparison with international competitions. Players are selected to represent the Australian state in which they played their first senior rugby league game. Before 1980 players were only selected for interstate matches based on where they were playing their club football at the time. In both 1980 and 1981, there were two interstate matches under the old selection rules and one experimental State of Origin match. From 1982 onwards a best-of-three match series has been played around the middle of the rugby league season for the State of Origin shield.
