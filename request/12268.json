  "/wiki/Army_of_Shadows": "Army of Shadows (French: L'arm\u00e9e des ombres) is a 1969 French drama-suspense film written and directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. It is a film adaptation of Joseph Kessel's 1943 book of the same name, which blends Kessel's own experiences as a member of the French Resistance with fictionalized versions of other Resistance members. Army of Shadows follows a small group of Resistance fighters as they move between safe houses, work with the Allied militaries, kill informers, and attempt to evade the capture and execution that they know is their most likely fate. While portraying its characters as heroic, the film presents a bleak, unromantic view of the Resistance. At the time of its initial release in France, Army of Shadows was not well received or widely seen. In the wake of the events of May 1968, French critics denounced the film for its perceived glorification of Charles de Gaulle; at the time, American art-film programmers took their cues from Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, which had attacked the film on this basis. Because of this, it was not released in the United States for almost forty years. In the mid-1990s Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma published a reappraisal of the film and Melville's work in general, leading to its restoration and re-release in 2006.",

He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement. During his early career as a film critic, Godard criticized mainstream French cinema's \"Tradition of Quality\", which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation. In response, he and like-minded critics began to make their own films. Many of Godard's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema. In 1964, Godard described his and his colleagues' impact: \"We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV.\" He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s; his approach in film conventions, politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave. Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references, several of his films expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy.",
