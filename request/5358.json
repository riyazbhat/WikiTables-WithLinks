  "/wiki/CcdA/CcdB_Type_II_Toxin-antitoxin_system": "The CcdA/CcdB Type II Toxin-antitoxin system is one example of the bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems that encode two proteins, one a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation (toxin) and the other its specific antidote (antitoxin). These systems preferentially guarantee growth of plasmid-carrying daughter cells in a bacterial population by killing newborn bacteria that have not inherited a plasmid copy at cell division (post-segregational killing).",

Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2, (which helps blood to clot when you have a cut to form a scab) and preventing colonisation of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter.  The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.",

  "/wiki/Copy-number_variation": "Copy number variation (CNV) is a phenomenon in which sections of the genome are repeated and the number of repeats in the genome varies between individuals. Copy number variation is a type of structural variation: specifically, it is a type of duplication or deletion event that affects a considerable number of base pairs. However, note that although modern genomics research is mostly focused on human genomes, copy number variations also occur in a variety of other organisms including E. coli and S. cerevisiae.  Recent research indicates that approximately two thirds of the entire human genome is composed of repeats and 4.8\u20139.5% of the human genome can be classified as copy number variations. In mammals, copy number variations play an important role in generating necessary variation in the population as well as disease phenotype.",

  "/wiki/Chromosome": "A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle. This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.",
  "/wiki/Archaea": "Archaea (/\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8ki\u02d0\u0259/ (listen) or /\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8ke\u026a\u0259/ ar-KEE-\u0259 or ar-KAY-\u0259) (singular archaeon) constitute a domain of single-celled organisms. These microorganisms lack cell nuclei and are therefore prokaryotes. Archaea were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outmoded. They have been renamed to clarify that archaea are not only not bacteria, but are more closely related to eukaryotes (life whose cells can have a nucleus, including humans) than to real bacteria.",

  "/wiki/Zeta_toxin_protein_domain": "In molecular biology, the protein domain Zeta (\u03b6) toxin refers to a protein domain found in prokaryotes, which acts as a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine kinase. Its function is to inhibit cell wall biosynthesis and it may act as a bactericide in nature. It is also thought that Zeta toxin induces reversible protective dormancy and permeation to propidium iodide (PI).",

  "/wiki/Shigatoxigenic_and_verotoxigenic_Escherichia_coli": "Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) and verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) are strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli that produce either Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin (verotoxin).  Only a minority of the strains cause illness in humans.[failed verification] The ones that do are collectively known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and are major causes of foodborne illness. When infecting humans, they often cause gastroenteritis, enterocolitis, and bloody diarrhea (hence the name \"enterohemorrhagic\") and sometimes cause a severe complication called hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The group and its subgroups are known by various names. They are distinguished from other strains of intestinal pathogenic E. coli including enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC).",

  "/wiki/Toxin-antitoxin_system": "A toxin-antitoxin system is a set of two or more closely linked genes that together encode both a \"toxin\" protein and a corresponding \"antitoxin\". Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies. When these systems are contained on plasmids\u00a0\u2013 transferable genetic elements\u00a0\u2013 they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK)."
