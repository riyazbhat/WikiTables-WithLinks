His original given name was Morinobu; he was the eldest son of Kan\u014d Takanobu and grandson of Kan\u014d Eitoku. Many of the most famous and widely known Kan\u014d works today are by Tan'y\u016b.\n In 1617, Tan'y\u016b was appointed by the Tokugawa shogunate to become the shogunate's first official painter. Over the following years, he was given many highly prestigious commissions. Over the 1620s and 1630s, he created a number of large-scale works for Edo Castle, Nij\u014d Castle, Osaka Castle, Nagoya Castle, and Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b.\n Prolific in a variety of painting styles, Tan'y\u016b's most famous works are probably those he produced for these large-scale commissions. They are screens and panels, prime examples of the Momoyama style, depicting natural subjects such as tigers, birds and plants, in bright colors and with extensive use of gold leaf. The gold, often used to represent clouds, water, or other background elements, would reflect what little light was available indoors, brightening a castle's dark rooms.\n Tan'y\u016b was also accomplished, however, in monochrome ink painting based on the prototypical style of the Muromachi period, yamato-e compositions in a style similar to that of the Tosa school, and Chinese style scrolls. His most famous yamato-e work is a narrative handscroll depicting the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa sh\u014dgun and major figure in Japanese history. It was after this commission, in 1640, that the artist first took on the \"artist name\" of Tan'y\u016b.\n In addition to being a highly honored and respected painter in his own right, Tan'y\u016b was known as a collector and connoisseur of Chinese paintings. He made sketches and kept records of many of the paintings that passed through his studio, brought to him for authentication.",
