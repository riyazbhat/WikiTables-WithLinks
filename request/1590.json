Three figure skating events were contested: men's singles, ladies' singles, and pair skating.\n Unseasonably warm weather in St. Moritz during the Games caused difficulty for the figure skating events, as the ice surface was outdoors. There was a proposal to move the competition to an indoor rink in Berlin or London, but colder weather returned before a decision could be made. However, the ice surface remained in poor condition for the duration of the Games. During the ladies' free skating, red flags were placed on the ice to mark the especially bad areas, which became more numerous as the competition progressed.",

  "/wiki/Bernt_Evensen": "Bernt Sverre Evensen (18 April 1905 \u2013 24 August 1979) was a Norwegian speed skater and racing cyclist who competed in skating at the 1928 and 1932 Winter Olympics. In 1928 he became the first Norwegian skater to win an Olympic gold medal by winning the 500 m event (first place shared with Clas Thunberg). At the same Olympics, he also won silver in the 1500 m and bronze over 5,000 m. He was in second place in the 10,000 m event, 0.1 seconds behind Irving Jaffee, when the competition was cancelled because the ice had started thawing. At the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid, Evensen won a silver medal in the 500 m. Evensen and compatriot Ivar Ballangrud were the only European Olympic speed skating medalists during those games. This can mostly be attributed to the fact that the races were skated in pack-style (having all competitors skate at the same time), a format that most European skaters were not familiar with. At the World Allround Championships, Evensen finished first in 1927 and 1934, second in 1931, and third in 1926, 1928, and 1932.
