The workshop was founded in 1872 by Bonaventura Eijsbouts as a factory for tower clocks. In 1893 Eijsbouts was joined by his 15-year-old son, Johan, and the workshop expanded to begin supplying striking and swinging bells, which were cast at other foundries, with their clocks. As interest in carillons increased, Johan Eijsbouts purchased bells from two English foundries, John Taylor Bellfounders and Gillett & Johnston, and installed them in carillons. In 1924, Johan's oldest son, Tuur Eijsbouts, joined the company. Tuur was technically minded and inventive. He took the initiative to learn how to cast bells himself. After years of experimentation, an in-house bell foundry was installed in 1947.",
