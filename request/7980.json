  "/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)": "Billboard, stylized as billboard, is an American entertainment media brand owned by the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, a division of Eldridge Industries. It publishes pieces involving news, video, opinion, reviews, events, and style, and is also known for its music charts, including the Hot 100 and Billboard 200, tracking the most popular songs and albums in different genres. It also hosts events, owns a publishing firm, and operates several TV shows. Billboard was founded in 1894 by William Donaldson and James Hennegan as a trade publication for bill posters. Donaldson later acquired Hennegen's interest in 1900 for $500. In the early years of the 20th century, it covered the entertainment industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows, and also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.",
  "/wiki/Metamorphosis_(Hilary_Duff_album)": "Metamorphosis is the debut studio album by American actress and singer Hilary Duff. The album was released on August 26, 2003, by Hollywood Records as the follow-up to her Christmas album Santa Claus Lane (2002). According to Duff, the album incorporates elements of pop and rock music, and it represents changes that are specific to her life and that everyone experiences. Duff worked with several producers on the album such as The Matrix. Others who collaborated on the album include Chico Bennett, Matthew Gerrard, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi. The album coincided with other high-profile projects in which she was involved in other media. Metamorphosis received mixed reviews from music critics; some complimented it for being a modern-day bubblegum album, while others considered the album to be a promotional gimmick for Duff, lacking real substance. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 203,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest opening week sales figure for a debut album by a female artist in 2003. In the following week, the album rose to number one on the chart. It became the eighth best-selling album of 2003 in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan, selling 2.6 million copies in a period of five months. By late 2005, the album had sold five million copies worldwide. For Hollywood Records, Metamorphosis was the label's first high-seller in several years and led to the company's further successful cultivation of new artists and brands using the Disney Channel.",

  "/wiki/Hilary_Duff_(album)": "Hilary Duff is the self-titled second studio album by American singer Hilary Duff. It was released on September 28, 2004, by Hollywood Records. Duff cited the album as being more mature than her previous albums, stating Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore. The seventeen-track album saw Duff collaborating with the same producers she did on Metamorphosis, saying that it was more comfortable for her that way. Recording sessions for the album took place during May to August 2004, partially between filming of Raise Your Voice (2004) and The Perfect Man (2005), both in which Duff had starring roles. The album was a modest commercial success, and it received generally negative reviews from music critics, many of whom compared the album to the music of Avril Lavigne and Ashlee Simpson. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 192,000 copies in its first week. To date, Hilary Duff has sold 1,800,000 copies in the US, a disappointment compared to her debut album which sold 5 million copies. It became her second consecutive number one debut in Canada and produced two singles that were not major hits. It was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Hilary Duff was number sixty-five on Billboard magazine's year-end top albums chart in November 2005. The lead single from Hilary Duff, Fly premiered on August 26, 2004, on MTV's Total Request Live.",

  "/wiki/Most_Wanted_(Hilary_Duff_album)": "Most Wanted is the first compilation album by American actress and singer Hilary Duff. It was released on August 10, 2005, by Hollywood Records. The album comprises ten previously released tracks (three of which are in a remixed form), and three new recordings: Wake Up, Beat of My Heart, and Break My Heart. A deluxe edition of the album, subtitled The Collector's Signature Edition, was also released, containing additional remixes and another new recording Supergirl. At first, Duff was concerned about the reaction of fans to the new songs, since they carry a totally different sound and are more dance-oriented than her previous music. Following its release, Most Wanted received mostly negative reviews from critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff did not have enough material to warrant a compilation. However, the Dead Executives-produced tracks received favorable comments; critics wrote that they stood out from the rest of the album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Duff's second number one entry on the chart. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand. Four singles were released from the album. The lead single, Wake Up, was released in August 2005, and peaked within the top ten in countries including Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom.",
  "/wiki/Dignity_(Hilary_Duff_album)": "Dignity is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Hilary Duff. It was released on March 21, 2007, by Hollywood Records. After launching her third record Hilary Duff (2004), she experienced an eventful personal life, including a stalking incident, her parents getting divorced and breaking up with her boyfriend of two years Joel Madden. Consequently, Duff assumed an integral position in its production, co-writing almost every track with longtime collaborator Kara DioGuardi instead of her previously-limited involvement. Duff was musically inspired by indie rock band the Faint and pop singers Beyonc\u00e9 and Gwen Stefani. In contrast to the pop rock themes of her prior releases, Dignity takes on more of a dance sound, which she said was not her intention while writing the album. The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album's release, and the album's songs contain influences of rock and roll and hip hop music. Critical response was mostly positive; the album was praised for its songwriting and her new musical direction. Upon release, Dignity debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, a lower peak than Duff's previous albums and with lower sales, which Billboard attributed to the loss of fans during her musical evolution. Despite this, it produced Duff's highest-peaking single on US Billboard Hot 100 to date, With Love, which peaked at number twenty-four, and two number one club hits on US Hot Dance Club Play. The album has reached the top ten in several countries and was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). To promote the album, Duff embarked on her fourth concert tour, the Dignity Tour, between July 2007 and February 2008."
