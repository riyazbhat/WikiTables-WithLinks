  "/wiki/Call_signs_in_North_America": "Call signs are frequently still used by North American broadcast stations, in addition to amateur radio and other international radio stations that continue to identify by call signs around the world. Each country has a different set of patterns for its own call signs. Call signs are allocated to ham radio stations in Barbados, Canada, Mexico and across the United States. Many countries have specific conventions for classifying call signs by transmitter characteristics and location. The call sign format for radio and television call signs follows a number of conventions. All call signs begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union. For example, the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: AAA-ALZ, K, N, W. For a complete list, see international call sign allocations.",
  "/wiki/Frequency": "Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example: if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its period, T, - the time interval between beats - is half a second (60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio signals (sound), radio waves, and light.",

The station's studios are south of downtown near Philander Smith College, and the transmitter tower is located on Shinall Mountain, near the Chenal Valley neighborhood of Little Rock. On June 1, 1998, after a 10-day stunt with various genres of music, 101.1 FM signed on as modern rock-formatted Lick 101 KDRE. According to FCC filings, the station went silent sometime around November 1, 2008, as the licensee was unable to negotiate an extension of the contract with the owner of the transmitter location. The FCC granted permission to remain silent while the station's owner put together the paperwork to move the transmitter to a new location. Since then, the transmitter has moved to a different location, the call letters have changed from KWBF-FM to KZTS, and the format has changed from Rhythmic Oldies, to Adult Album Alternative, to the current Mainstream Urban format. With the exception of the station being the Little Rock affiliate for The Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the station had no on-air personalities. Under its previous format, KZTS' main competitor was longtime heritage urban contemporary outlet KIPR. On March 13, 2018, it was announced by media sources that Flinn Broadcasting Corporation would sell Urban KZTS to Salem Communications for $1.1 million plus a time brokerage agreement before closing.

Memphis is the seat of Shelby County, the most populous county in Tennessee. As one of the more historic and culturally significant cities of the southern United States, the city features a wide variety of landscapes and distinct neighborhoods. The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into the New World. The high Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish, French, and the English as Memphis took shape. Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans: John Overton, James Winchester, and future president Andrew Jackson. Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods, natural resources like lumber, and the American slave trade. After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton and lumber.
