  "/wiki/Panamanian_night_monkey": "The Panamanian night monkey or Chocoan night monkey (Aotus zonalis) is a species of night monkey formerly considered a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey of the family Aotidae. Its range consists of Panama and the Choc\u00f3 region of Colombia. There are also unconfirmed reports of its occurrence in Costa Rica, especially on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The species definitely occurs in the Atlantic lowlands of Panama close to the Costa Rica border. The exact classification of the Panamanian Night Monkey is uncertain. While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey, A. lemurinus, other authors follow a study by Thomas Defler from 2001, which concluded that it is a separate species, A. zonalis. The Panamanian night monkey is a relatively small monkey, with males weighing approximately 889 grams (31.4 oz) and females weighing about 916 grams (32.3 oz). The fur on the back ranges from grayish brown to reddish brown.",
  "/wiki/Gray-handed_night_monkey": "The gray-handed night monkey (Aotus griseimembra) is a species of night monkey formerly considered a subspecies of Gray-bellied night monkey of the family Aotidae. Its range consists of parts of Colombia and Venezuela. The exact classification of the gray-handed night monkey is uncertain. While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey, A. lemurinus, other authors consider it a separate species,  A. griseimembra. In Colombia, its range consists of the northern portion from the Sin\u00fa River (or perhaps further east) to the Venezuelan border, including the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Magdalena River, Cauca River and Sao Jorge River valleys. In Venezuela, it is found to the west and south of Maracaibo.

It was first described in 2007 by Thomas Defler and Marta Bueno. It has a gray neck and a white patch over each eye, separated by a black band. The fur on the chest, belly, lower arms and lower wrists is thick and white. It differs from other gray-necked night monkey species other than Brumback's night monkey in having 50 chromosomes. It is believed to live in Colombia on the western slopes and foothills of the Andes, between Quind\u00edo and Risaralda. It is possible that it occurs in Tatam\u00e1 Natural National Park. This range is currently also considered part of the range of the Panamanian night monkey.",

He is the author of many papers about primates and of the books Primates de Colombia (2003),  Primates of Colombia (2004) and Historia Natural de los Primates Colombianos (2010) . He also edited a monograph on woolly monkeys.

  "/wiki/Three-striped_night_monkey": "The three-striped night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), also known as northern night monkey or northern owl monkey, is one of several species of owl monkeys currently recognised. It is found in Venezuela and north-central Brazil. Until 1983, all the owl monkeys were regarded as subspecies of Aotus trivirgatus, and all were referred to as douroucoulis. The use of the name douroucouli exclusively for the three-striped night monkey is not universally accepted; some authors use it for the entire genus, or for the grey-necked group of species within it (to which A. trivirgatus belongs). Like other owl monkeys, the three-striped night monkey lives in woodlands including rain forest. It is mainly black, with striking white markings on its face. Its body size is 27\u201348 cm, and its tail is about the same length again. Adults weigh up to 1 kg.",

  "/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt": "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (14 September 1769 \u2013 6 May 1859) was a Prussian polymath, geographer, naturalist, explorer, and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science. He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography. Humboldt's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring. Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas, exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view. His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years. Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise, Kosmos, in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture.",
