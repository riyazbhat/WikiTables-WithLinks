  "/wiki/Bethel_Church_(Morning_Sun,_Iowa)": "Bethel Church is a historic church building in rural Morning Sun, Iowa, United States. The congregation was organized by the Wapello mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Iowa in 1854. In addition to the Morning Sun congregation, the Wapello mission included congregations in Concord, Long Creek, and two in Wapello. The property for the church building and its adjacent cemetery was donated by Merit Jamison. Members of the congregation built the building under the supervision of stonemason Francis McGraw. The limestone structure is a Vernacular form of Iowa folk architecture. The small cornice returns are influenced by the Greek Revival style. The plain interior features plastered walls, plank flooring and wood-carved furnishings from the church's early years. The iron fence that runs along the gravel road was added in 1861. The church is no used for regularly scheduled services. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_61": "U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 (US\u00a061) is a major United States highway which extends 1,400 miles (2,300\u00a0km) between New Orleans, Louisiana and the city of Wyoming, Minnesota. The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River, and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35). Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth and across the Canada\u2013U.S. border, near Grand Portage. Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (US 90). The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; the Mississippi Delta, and New Orleans.\nThe route was an important south-north connection in the days before the interstate highway system. Many southerners traveled north along US\u00a061 while going to St. Louis and Saint Paul.",

  "/wiki/County_Line_Bridge_(Columbus_Junction,_Iowa)": "County Line Bridge is a historic structure located in a rural area west of Columbus Junction, Iowa, United States. The Louisa County Board of Supervisors approved the petition of Thomas Anwyl in April 1893 to build a bridge over Long Creek on the Louisa-Washington county line. They awarded a $1,174 contract to the Gillette-Herzog Manufacturing Company of Minneapolis to build two bridges. The second span was the Gipple's Quarry Bridge over Buffington Creek in Elm Grove Township. The bridge span is supported by cast iron columns that were manufactured by the Cast Iron Pile and Bridge Company of Keosauqua, Iowa. The steel components were rolled by Carnegie, Gillette-Herzog in Pittsburgh. The pony truss bridge is typical of those built in the same era in Iowa, however, like Gipple's Quarry Bridge it has an unusual lower chord configuration with end panels that slope downward from the bearing shoes to the center panels. It has subsequently been abandoned. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.",
