  "/wiki/Thomas_Wassberg": "Thomas Lars Wassberg (born 27 March 1956) is a Swedish former cross-country skier. A fast skating style - push for every leg - is still called Wassberg after him in several countries. Wassberg's skiing idols when growing up were Sixten Jernberg and Oddvar Br\u00e5. He has described his mental strength and physical fitness as his greatest abilities as a skier, with his main weakness being a lack of sprinting ability. Wassberg won four Olympic gold medals: in 15 km (1980), 50 km (1984), and the 4 \u00d7 10 km relay (1984, 1988), and served as the Olympic flag bearer for Sweden in 1988. At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, he earned three golds (50 km: 1982, 30 km: 1987, and 4 \u00d7 10 km relay: 1987), three silvers (15 km: 1985, 1987; 50 km (1987), and one bronze (4 \u00d7 10 km relay: 1985). Additionally, Wassberg won the 50 km at the Holmenkollen ski festival three times (1980, 1982 and 1987) and the 15 km twice (1979, 1985). At the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, Wassberg edged out Finland's Juha Mieto by 0.01 seconds in the 15 km, the closest cross-country ski race in Olympic history. Wassberg subsequently suggested to Mieto that the gold medal should be split between them as one one-hundredth of a second is nothing in a 15-kilometer race. This incident led the International Ski Federation (FIS) to change their timing to the nearest one-tenth of a second. It also resulted in an apocryphal urban legend that Wassberg and Mieto's medals were cut in half and re-welded into half-gold, half-silver medals. At the 1984 Winter Olympics, Wassberg beat out fellow Swede Gunde Svan by 4.9 seconds in the 50 km, the closest margin of victory ever in that event until Giorgio Di Centa edged out Yevgeny Dementyev by 0.8 seconds at the 2006 Winter Olympics though the 2006 event was a mass start event while the 1984 event was an interval start event.",
