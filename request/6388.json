  "/wiki/Comic_Cuts": "Comic Cuts was a British comic book magazine. It was created by the reporter Alfred Harmsworth through his company Amalgamated Press (AP). It was published from 1890 to 1953, lasting for 3006 issues. In its early days, it inspired other publishers to produce rival comics. Its first issue was an assortment of reprints from American publications. During its lifetime, the comic merged with many others including Golden Penny (1928), Jolly Comic (1939) and Larks (1940). Comic Cuts finally disappeared in September 1953 when it was merged with Knockout. Comic Cuts held the record for the most issues of a British weekly comic for 46 years, until The Dandy overtook it in 1999. The comic is mentioned in G. K. Chesterton's 1905 book Heretics and in the1910 book Alarms and Discursions, and in a line of Cyril Tawney's song Chicken on a Raft - He's looking at me Comic Cuts again. It was also mentioned in Clive Dunn's 1971 hit record Grandad - Comic Cuts, all different things. The character Annie Twohig refers to it in Lennox Robinson's play Drama at Inish (Annie: I'll stay at home and read a magazine. Constance: Which magazine?",
  "/wiki/The_Dandy": "The Dandy was a British children's comic magazine published by the Dundee based publisher DC Thomson. The first issue was printed in December 1937, making it the world's third-longest running comic, after Il Giornalino (cover dated 1 October 1924) and Detective Comics (cover dated March 1937). From August 2007 until October 2010, it was rebranded as Dandy Xtreme. One of the best selling comics in the UK, along with The Beano, The Dandy reached sales of two million a week in the 1950s. The final printed edition was issued on 4 December 2012, the comic's 75th anniversary, after sales slumped to 8,000 a week. On the same day, The Dandy relaunched as an online comic, The Digital Dandy, appearing on the Dandy website and in the Dandy App. The digital relaunch was not successful and the comic ended just six months later.",
  "/wiki/The_Beano": "The Beano is the longest running British children's comic magazine, published by DC Thomson in Dundee, Scotland. The comic first appeared on 30 July 1938, and was published weekly. In September 2009, The Beano's 3,500th issue was published. One of the best selling comics in the UK, along with The Dandy, the weekly circulation of The Beano in April 1950 was 1,974,072. The Beano is currently edited by John Anderson. Each issue is published on a Wednesday, with the issue date being that of the following Saturday. The Beano reached its 4,000th issue on 28 August 2019. Its characters include Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx, The Bash Street Kids, The Numskulls, Roger the Dodger, Billy Whizz and Tricky Dicky. Earlier characters who have been phased out include Ball Boy, Les Pretend, Ivy the Terrible, The Three Bears and Pansy Potter. Some old characters, like Biffo the Bear, Lord Snooty, Baby Face Finlayson and Little Plum, have more recently made a return as funsize quarter-page strips. The style of Beano humour has shifted noticeably over the years, though the longstanding tradition of anarchic humour has remained. Historically, many protagonists were characterised by their immoral behaviour, e.g.",
  "/wiki/Eagle_(comic)": "Eagle was a British children's comics periodical, first published from 1950 to 1969, and then in a relaunched format from 1982 to 1994. It was founded by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called The Anvil, but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively. Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children's literature, he and Anvil artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values. Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on. Following a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of Eagle was released in April 1950. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included Riders of the Range and P.C. 49. Eagle also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale.",
  "/wiki/Lion_(comics)": "Lion was a weekly British comics periodical published by Fleetway (a subsidiary of IPC, the International Publishing Corporation) from 23 February 1952 to 18 May 1974. It lasted for 1,156 issues.",
  "/wiki/Bunty": "Bunty was a British comic for girls published by D. C. Thomson & Co. from 1958 to 2001. It consisted of a collection of many small strips, the stories typically being three to five pages long. As well as the weekly comic, Christmas and summer annuals were published. Bunty published 2,249 issues, and went monthly in 2001 before ceasing publication after a further 5 months. In contrast to earlier and contemporary comics, it was aimed primarily at working-class readers under the age of 14, and contained mostly fictional stories.",
  "/wiki/Buster_(comics)": "Buster was a British comic which began publication in 1960, originally published by IPC Magazines Ltd under the companies comic division Fleetway, then by Egmont UK Ltd under the same imprint until its closure in 2000. Despite missing issues due to industrial action during its run, the comic published 1,902 issues in total. The comic carried a mixture of humour and adventure strips, featuring the title character Buster and a host of other characters.",
  "/wiki/Valiant_(comics)": "Valiant was a British boys adventure comics anthology which ran from 1962 to 1976. It was published by IPC Magazines and was one of their major adventure titles throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.",
  "/wiki/Wham!_(comics)": "Wham! was a weekly British comic book magazine published by Odhams Press. It ran for 187 issues from 20 June 1964 to 13 January 1968, when it merged into its sister title Pow!. Although Wham! was superficially a typical British comic in the mould of The Beano, its later issues (under the Power Comics imprint) included short instalments of The Fantastic Four reprinted from American Marvel Comics. The initial success of Wham! prompted the creation of sister titles Pow! and Smash! with similar intent, and led to the formation of the Power Comics line. But as costs rose in 1968, the inevitable adjustment of content, followed by mergers of titles, made the Power Comics more like those they were attempting to replace. Created by Leo Baxendale, in its early issues Wham! presented both clear imitations of Beano strips, such as a clone of his Bash Street Kids in the shape of The Tiddlers, and new original strips such as Eagle Eye, Junior Spy and Georgie's Germs in which he attempted to break the mould of older strips by the use of bizarre humour, outrageous puns, and surreal plots.",
  "/wiki/Smash!_(comics)": "Smash! was a weekly British comic book, published in London by Odhams Press Ltd from 64 Long Acre and subsequently by IPC Magazines Ltd from (initially) 189 High Holborn and (latterly) Fleetway House in nearby Farringdon Street. It ran for 257 issues, between 5 February 1966 and 3 April 1971 (although, due to strikes and industrial disputes, publication was not continuous during that period). It then merged into Valiant. But the Smash! Annual, published mainly under the Fleetway imprint, continued to appear every year: the final Annual, cover-dated 1976, was published in the autumn of 1975. During 1967 and 1968 Smash! was part of Odhams' Power Comics line (from #44 to #143), absorbing its sister titles Pow! on 14 September 1968 (issue 137) and Fantastic on 2 November 1968 (issue 144). As Pow! and Fantastic had themselves already merged with Wham! and Terrific respectively, Smash!",
  "/wiki/Pow!_(comic)": "Pow! was a weekly British comic book published by Odhams Press in 1967 and 1968 from their headquarters at 64 Long Acre, London. Part of their Power Comics imprint, it was printed on newsprint stock, in black-and-white except for its colour front and back covers, and initially comprised 28 pages. Pow! first appeared on 21 January 1967. After 12 months, with its 53rd issue cover-dated 13 January 1968, it merged with its sister title Wham! to form Pow and Wham. The 86th and final issue appeared on 7 September 1968, after which it merged into Smash!, another of the Power Comics line.",
  "/wiki/Fantastic_(comics)": "Fantastic was a weekly British comic book magazine published by Odhams Press under the Power Comics imprint. It first appeared on 18 February 1967, and with its 52nd issue on 10 February 1968 it merged with its sister title Terrific. The 89th and final issue of Fantastic appeared on 7 September 1968, after which it was merged into Smash!. Fantastic was different from the earlier Power Comics such as Smash! and Pow!, which were essentially traditional Beano-style British comic papers supplemented by a small amount of material reprinted from Marvel Comics. In contrast, Fantastic (and later Terrific as well) were more American in appearance, resembling the black-and-white comic anthologies of the time such as Creepy and Eerie. However, they were aimed at a younger audience than such magazines (although an older audience than the Beano-style British fare).",
  "/wiki/Terrific_(comics)": "Terrific was a weekly British comic published by Odhams Press under the Power Comics imprint. It ran for 43 issues from 15 April 1967 until 3 February 1968, when it was merged with its sister title Fantastic. Terrific was very similar in format to Fantastic, which had started publication two months earlier. The two titles were quite unlike other British comics of the time, consisting mainly of material reprinted from American Marvel Comics. In this respect they can be considered a precursor of the Marvel UK weeklies, such as The Mighty World of Marvel, that appeared during the 1970s. The Marvel titles which were reprinted in Terrific included The Avengers, the Doctor Strange strips from Strange Tales, and the Sub-Mariner and Giant-Man strips from Tales to Astonish.",
  "/wiki/Action_(comics)": "Action is a controversial weekly British anthology comic that was published by IPC Magazines, starting on 14 February 1976. Concerns over the comic's violent content saw it withdrawn from sale on 16 October 1976. It reappeared the following month, in toned-down form, and continued publication until 12 November 1977, at which point it was merged with Battle Picture Weekly. Despite its short lifespan, Action was highly influential on the British comics scene, and was a direct forerunner of the long-running 2000 AD.",
  "/wiki/2000_AD_(comics)": "2000 AD is a weekly British science fiction-oriented comic magazine. As a comics anthology it serialises stories in each issue (known as progs)[note 1] and was first published by IPC Magazines in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its Fleetway comics subsidiary, which was sold to Robert Maxwell in 1987 and then to Egmont UK in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by Rebellion Developments. 2000 AD is most noted for its Judge Dredd stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, Grant Morrison, Brian Bolland and Mike McMahon. Other characters in 2000 AD include Rogue Trooper, Strontium Dog and the ABC Warriors.",
  "/wiki/Starlord_(comics)": "Starlord was a short-lived weekly British science fiction comic book magazine published by IPC in 1978 as a sister title to 2000 AD, which had been launched the previous year in anticipation of a science fiction boom surrounding Star Wars. Starlord was planned as a fortnightly title for older readers, with longer stories and higher production values than 2000 AD and the rest of the IPC boys' comics stable, but this proved too ambitious. Episodes were shortened, the number of colour pages was reduced, although the better quality paper and printing were retained, and Starlord was published weekly at a higher cover price than 2000 AD.",
  "/wiki/Tornado_(comics)": "Tornado was a short-lived weekly British comic magazine published for 22 issues by IPC Magazines between March 1979 and August 1979. After the cancellations of the Starlord and Action titles, IPC launched Tornado as a way to use up stories already commissioned for the other titles. Like Action it was a mixed title featuring war, detective, horror and science fiction stories. Its first editor was Kelvin Gosnell, who was followed by Dave Hunt. Tornado was printed on the low quality newsprint stock used by 2000 AD and also had five stories of four to six pages per issue. The title also had a 'superpowered' editor, like Tharg, 'Big E' who was portrayed in photo-strips by a rather portly Dave Gibbons.",
  "/wiki/Warrior_(comics)": "Warrior was a British comics anthology that ran for 26 issues between March 1982 and January 1985. It was edited by Dez Skinn and published by his company Quality Communications. It featured early work by comics writer Alan Moore, including V for Vendetta and Marvelman. This series of 26 issues in the 1980s was essentially a Volume #2; Skinn had edited/published #s 1-6 of a black-and-white fanzine version of Warrior (full title: Warrior: Heroic Tales Of Swords and Sorcery) in 1974-75, with reprint and new strips, art and writing from Steve Parkhouse, Dave Gibbons [designed logo], Michael Moorcock, Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence, Barry Windsor-Smith, et al. Rivalling 2000 AD, Warrior won 17 Eagle Awards during its short run (including nine Eagles in 1983 alone). Because of traditional distribution and its format, it was one of the comic books in the British market that didn't just rely upon distribution through then format-driven specialist shops and expensive subscriptions for its sales base.",
  "/wiki/Scream!_(comics)": "Scream! was a British weekly horror comic anthology that was published for 15 issues by IPC Magazines in 1984. Controversy over horror comics had led to the introduction of the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955, under which the first prosecution occurred in 1970. The editorial approach to Scream! was to de-emphasise the horror label and deliberately not repeat the style of its more controversial precursors, making it more tongue-in-cheek for younger readers, as evidenced by its coverline not for the nervous.",
  "/wiki/Oink!_(comics)": "Oink! was a British comic book magazine for children which was published from 3 May 1986 to 22 October 1988. It set out to be deliberately anarchic, reminiscent of Viz but for children. The creators also cited Mad magazine as a major influence. Part of its difference in the marketplace was that it attracted writers and cartoonists from a wide range of previous disciplines. It was devised, launched and edited by Patrick Gallagher, Private Eye regular contributor Tony Husband and Mark Rodgers, although within the fiction of the comic it was edited by a character called Uncle Pigg (similar to 2000 AD's Tharg the Mighty). The comic also followed 2000 AD's lead in crediting its contributors for their work, still a rarity in British comics at that time. Featured artists and writers included Husband's Private Eye colleague David Haldane, ex-The Fall member and future BBC Radio 1 radio host Marc Lard Riley, Malcolm Douglas, Brickman creator Lew Stringer, future Beano writer/artist Kev F Sutherland, future Marvel artist, writer and editor & current SpongeBob SquarePants Magazine editor David Leach, future Financial Times cartoonist Jeremy Banks, and satirical media commentator-to-be Charlie Brooker. Viz founders Davy Thorp and Chris Donald also contributed some one-off strips, as did The Beano's Tom Paterson and John Geering. Oink! proved somewhat controversial, with various conservative groups and a chain of newsagents branding it offensive and unsuitable for children. A notably controversial item was the story Janice and John and the Parachute Jump, a parody of the Janet and John readers which appeared in issue 7, which prompted an official complaint to the Press Council."
