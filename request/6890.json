  "/wiki/Finger_5": "Finger Five (\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc5, Fing\u0101 Faibu) was a Japanese pop group, composed of the four Okinawan Tamamoto brothers, Kazuo, Mitsuo, Masao, Akira, and sister Taeko. Their greatest hit was Koi No Dial 6700 (\u604b\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb6700 - Love Call 6700). The Okinawa-based group performed catchy songs, wore matching outfits and had choreographed dance routines. They even performed cover versions of Motown hits, including those of the Jackson 5. The band was formed in 1967 with only the three brothers Kazuo, Mitsuo and Masao, who performed as All Brothers. Conveniently their father owned a bar in Okinawa at which they performed. After winning a local talent contest it was decided that they could go farther if based in Tokyo, although at the time the eldest brother Kazuo was still only 14. The group, who were partly inspired by the Partridge Family TV show, struggled in the Tokyo area, often playing at venues that catered to US military, as they had done in Okinawa.",
