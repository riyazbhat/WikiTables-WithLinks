The team finished ninth in the Eastern Conference that year, failing to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second consecutive year, which was also the first time the team missed out on the playoffs in consecutive years since the 1960s. It was also the first full season the Bruins were without longtime team captain Ray Bourque since the 1979\u201380 season, who would win the Stanley Cup as a member of the Colorado Avalanche at season's end and subsequently retire from the NHL.\n The Bruins tied the Carolina Hurricanes in points for the regular season at 88. However, Carolina had two more wins than the Bruins, leaving the Bruins in the ninth position in the conference, narrowly missing the playoffs. Boston was without starting goaltender Byron Dafoe for much of the season, and the Bruins had to use five goaltenders throughout the season. The good news is that the Bruins saw some of their young core mature further, as Joe Thornton set a then-career high in goals with 37, and Jason Allison once again broke the 30-goal plateau.",

He was selected first overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft and went on to play seven seasons with the club, three as its captain.

Splitting the campaign between the two teams, he received the Art Ross and Hart Memorial Trophies as the league's leading point-scorer and most valuable player, respectively.\n Thornton's on-ice vision, strength on the puck, deft passing ability and power forward style of play have led to him becoming one of the league's premier top line centres. He is widely regarded as one of the best passers of all-time, and is one of only 13 players in history with 1,000 NHL assists. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, he received the nickname \"Jumbo Joe\" or \"Jumbo\" due to his size and Jumbo the elephant who was killed in 1885 in St. Thomas, Ontario, where Thornton was raised.",
