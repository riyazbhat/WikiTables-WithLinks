  "/wiki/Harvey_Kurtzman": "Harvey Kurtzman (/\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0rtsm\u0259n/; October\u00a03, 1924\u00a0\u2013 February\u00a021, 1993) was an American cartoonist and editor.  His best-known work includes writing and editing the parodic comic book Mad from 1952 until 1956, and illustrating the Little Annie Fanny strips in Playboy from 1962 until 1988.  His work is noted for its satire and parody of popular culture, social critique, and attention to detail.  Kurtzman's working method has been likened to that of an auteur, and he expected those who illustrated his stories to follow his layouts strictly.\n Kurtzman began to work on the New Trend line of comic books at EC Comics  in 1950.  He wrote and edited the Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat war comic books, where he also drew many of the carefully researched stories, before he created his most-remembered comic book, Mad, in 1952.  Kurtzman scripted the stories and had them drawn by top EC cartoonists, most frequently Will Elder, Wally Wood, and Jack Davis; the early Mad was noted for its social critique and parodies of pop culture.  The comic book switched to a magazine format in 1955, and Kurtzman left it in 1956 over a dispute with EC's owner William Gaines over financial control.  Following his departure, he did a variety of cartooning work, including editing the short-lived Trump and the self-published Humbug.  In 1959, he produced the first book-length work of original comics, the adult-oriented, satirical Jungle Book.  He edited the low-budget Help! from 1960 to 1965, a humor magazine which featured work by future Monty Python member Terry Gilliam and the earliest work of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton.  He brought Help! to an end after the success of the risqu\u00e9 Playboy feature Little Annie Fanny began to take up his time.  While Annie Fanny provided much of his income for the rest of his career, he continued to produce an eclectic body of work, including screenwriting the animated Mad Monster Party? in 1967 and directing, writing and designing several shorts for Sesame Street in 1969.\n From 1973, Kurtzman taught cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York.  His work gained greater recognition toward the end of his life, and he oversaw deluxe reprintings of much of his work.  The Harvey Award was named in Kurtzman's honor in 1988.  He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1989, and his work earned five positions on The Comics Journal's Top 100 Comics of the 20th Century.",

He had a feel for the kind of satire that eventually spread everywhere.\"\n Elder was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2003.

Rooney's story was inspired by sensationalistic media coverage of an American Motorcyclist Association motorcycle rally that got out of hand on the Fourth of July weekend in 1947 in Hollister, California. The overcrowding, drinking and street stunting were given national attention in the July 21, 1947, issue of Life, with a staged photograph of a wild drunken man on a motorcycle.

  "/wiki/Nautical_fiction": "Nautical fiction, frequently also naval fiction, sea fiction, naval adventure fiction or maritime fiction, is a genre of literature with a setting on or near the sea, that focuses on the human relationship to the sea and sea voyages and highlights nautical culture in these environments. The settings of nautical fiction vary greatly, including merchant ships, liners, naval ships, fishing vessels, life boats, etc., along with sea ports and fishing villages. When describing nautical fiction, scholars most frequently refer to novels, novellas, and short stories, sometimes under the name of sea novels or sea stories. These works are sometimes adapted for the theatre, film and television.\n The development of nautical fiction follows with the development of the English language novel and while the tradition is mainly British and North American, there are also significant works from literatures in Japan, France, Scandinavia, and other Western traditions. Though the treatment of themes and settings related to the sea and maritime culture is common throughout the history of western literature, nautical fiction, as a distinct genre, was first pioneered by James Fenimore Cooper (The Pilot, 1824) and Frederick Marryat (Frank Mildmay, 1829 and Mr Midshipman Easy 1836) at the beginning of the 19th century. There were 18th century and earlier precursors that have nautical settings, but few are as richly developed as subsequent works in this genre. The genre has evolved to include notable literary works like Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851), Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim (1899\u20131900), popular fiction like C.S. Forester's Hornblower series (1937\u201367), and works by authors that straddle the divide between popular and literary fiction, like Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series (1970\u20132004).\n Because of the historical dominance of nautical culture by men, they are usually the central characters, except for works that feature ships carrying women passengers. For this reason, nautical fiction is often marketed for men. Nautical fiction usually includes distinctive themes, such as a focus on masculinity and heroism, investigations of social hierarchies, and the psychological struggles of the individual in the hostile environment of the sea. Stylistically, readers of the genre expect an emphasis on adventure, accurate representation of maritime culture, and use of nautical language. Works of nautical fiction often include elements overlapping with other genres, including historical fiction, adventure fiction, war fiction, children's literature, fantasy stories, travel narratives (such as the Robinsonade), the social problem novel and psychological fiction.",

  "/wiki/Bob_Clarke_(illustrator)": "Robert J. \"Bob\" Clarke (January 25, 1926 \u2013 March 31, 2013) was an American illustrator whose work appeared in advertisements and MAD Magazine.  The label of the Cutty Sark bottle is his creation.  Clarke was born in Mamaroneck, New York. He resided in Seaford, Delaware.\n Clarke's style in MAD was distinctive, showing a mastery of line and an eye for the humorous side of things. \"I was known as the \"thing\" artist,\" said Clarke. \"Whether it was a telephone or a slot machine or whatever, I would draw the things.\"  MAD editor Al Feldstein called Clarke \"a singular valuable asset to MAD\u00a0... his arrival upon the scene was a godsend.\"  Feldstein's successor John Ficarra said of Clarke, \"He was a great designer, and he also was a terrific mimic of other people\u2019s styles... And if there was a problem you could give it to Bob, and he could usually solve it for you.\u201d\n Clarke's earliest professional job was at the age of 17, as an uncredited assistant on the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" comic strip. Ripley traveled the world collecting his fantastic trivia tidbits and sent them back to Clarke who drew them, captioned them and circulated them among the vast number of magazines and newspapers who carried the strip. Years later, he illustrated MAD's occasional \"Believe It or Nuts!\" parody.  After two years with Ripley, Clarke joined the army, where he worked for the European edition of Stars and Stripes and met his wife.  Clarke remained with Stars and Stripes after being discharged as a civilian contributor, before eventually returning to America and joining the advertising firm Geyer, Newell, and Ganger.  That job would prepare Clarke well for his MAD work: \"I learned about typefaces and layouts, how to prepare comps in the styles of many artists and cartoonists.\"  Clarke was among the GNG artists who designed the box for the children's game Candyland.\n Clarke was one of the artists who took up the slack after original editor Harvey Kurtzman left MAD, taking two of its three primary artists (Will Elder and Jack Davis) with him.  In his first year at MAD, Clarke illustrated 24 separate articles; he would eventually draw more than 600. Clarke was a mainstay of the magazine as it rose in circulation, being one of four general-purpose artists who took MAD through the late 1950s and earliest 1960s, the others being Wallace Wood, George Woodbridge and Joe Orlando (Jack Rickard's work appeared in mid-1961, while Don Martin, Mort Drucker and Dave Berg produced more specialized topics or features).\n Of the Wood-Orlando-Woodbridge-Clarke quartet, Bob Clarke had the most cartoon-like style.  This was exploited by the two circus panoramas that ran in MAD #41; the first depicted an old-time circus done by Wallace Wood, a breathtakingly elaborate vision of impossible spectacle.  The circus drawn by Clarke was simple and uncluttered, showing small routine acts.  The point of the article was the decline of the circus, and the artistic contrast sold the premise.\n But the versatile Clarke was also able to provide intricate detail.  In a 1999 interview, he remembered one challenging MAD assignment:",

  "/wiki/List_of_film_spoofs_in_Mad": "This list of film spoofs in Mad includes films spoofed (parodied) by the American comic magazine Mad. Usually, an issue of Mad features a spoof of at least one feature film or television program. The works selected by the staff of Mad are typically from cinema and television in the United States.\n The authors parody the original titles with puns or other wordplay. Characters are caricatured, and lampooned with joke names.\n These articles typically cover five pages or more, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader; in some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. This approach was also used for Mad's television parodies, and came to be identified with the magazine. The style was widely copied by other humor publications. In 1973, the promotional movie poster for Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye was designed in the introductory manner of a Mad parody, including the rectangular word balloons with self-referential dialogue; for verisimilitude, the poster was written and drawn by Mad regulars Frank Jacobs and Jack Davis.\n Many parodies end with the abrupt deus ex machina appearance of outside characters or pop culture figures who are similar in nature to the film or TV series being parodied, or who comment satirically on the theme. For example, Dr. Phil arrives to counsel the Desperate Housewives, or the cast of Sex and the City show up as the new hookers on Deadwood.\n The parodies frequently make comedic use of the fourth wall, breaking character, and meta-references. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to the technical aspects of filmmaking, the publicity, hype, or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles, any clich\u00e9s being used, and so on. In 2013, Film Comment wrote, \"While film studies majors gasp over the deconstruction of genre in the works of David Lynch and the meta-movies of Charlie Kaufman, 'the usual gang of idiots' over at MAD have been deconstructing, meta-narrativing, and postmodernizing motion pictures since the very first movie parody (Hah! Noon!) appeared in 1954.\" (However, Mad's first movie parody was actually Ping Pong.)\n Almost all of the parodies are of a single, particular film. However, Mad has occasionally done omnibus parodies of film series, such as the James Bond movies, the 1970s Planet of the Apes sequels, and the Twilight movies. It has also combined multiple mini-parodies of unrelated films into a single article. Some actors and directors have said that they regarded ridicule by Mad as an indication of major success in their careers.[citation needed]\n In recent years, the parodies and their creators have been available outside the pages of the regular magazine. The March/April 2013 issue of Film Comment (Film Society of the Lincoln Center) carried Grady Hendrix's historical survey of Mad's film parodies, titled \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9MAD\". In August 2016, four of Mad 's longtime contributors\u2014editor/artist Sam Viviano, writers Dick DeBartolo and Desmond Devlin, and artist Tom Richmond\u2014appeared at a public symposium in Nebraska to discuss their work in this particular medium. Mad has also published thematic collections of their past spoofs, from Oscar-winning films to superhero movies to gangster films."
