Originally established in Milan in 1925, Carrozzeria Touring became well known for both the beauty of its designs and patented superleggera construction methods. The business folded in 1966. In 2006 its brands and trademarks were purchased and a new firm established nearby to provide automotive design, engineering, coachbuilding, homologation services, non-automotive industrial design, and restoration of historic vehicles. Carrozzeria Touring was established on 25 March 1926 by Felice Bianchi Anderloni (1882\u20131948) and Gaetano Ponzoni. After achieving success through the middle of the 20th century, the business began to decline as automobile manufacturers replaced body-on-frame automobile construction with monocoque design and increasingly took coachbuilding in-house. After the original firm ceased production in 1966, Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni and Carrozzeria Marazzi preserved the Touring Superleggera trademark and used it on several occasions to support the company's heritage.

The Marzal remained a one-off, though the general shape and many of the ideas would later be used in the Lamborghini Espada. The Marzal design probably found wider recognition as a die-cast model, with both Dinky Toys and Matchbox making scale models, albeit in other colours such as orange, despite the original show car being painted silver. The Marzal appeared in action at a public event for the first time at the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix when Prince Rainier III, accompanied by his wife, Princess Grace, drove the car on his traditional parade lap before the start of the race.

The car was the first supercar with a rear mid-engined two-seat layout, although the concept was first pioneered by Ren\u00e9 Bonnet with the Matra Djet in 1964. This layout has since become the standard for high-performance sports and supercars. When released, it was the fastest production road car. The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini's engineering team, which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes of company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, who preferred powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car-derived machines produced by local rival Ferrari. The Miura's rolling chassis was presented at the 1965 Turin Auto Show, and the prototype P400 debuted at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show.

In 1987 it was considered for production as a companion car to the Bertone built Fiat X1/9. That Project 1 was, however, ended when Fiat stopped the production of the 1.5L SOHC engine and rear-mounted 5-speed transaxle.

The all-aluminium alloy engine was introduced as a 2.5-litre variant, displacing 2,463 cc (150.3 cu in), but was expanded, by increasing the piston stroke to a 3.0-litre variant for 1975 - now displacing 2,997 cc (182.9 cu in).\n A 2.0-litre reduced-stroke version was also introduced in 1975 for sale in Italy, displacing 1,994 cc (121.7 cu in), because of Italian legislation which imposed punitive taxes on cars whose engines displaced more than 2.0 litres.\n This V8 engine was also used in two other models, the Lamborghini Silhouette in 1976-1977 in which it kept the 3.0-litre displacement, and the slightly updated replacement in 1982, the Lamborghini Jalpa, which saw the engine increased in size to 3.5 litres, displacing 3,485 cc (212.7 cu in), for ease in meeting ever-tighter emissions requirements.",

The redesign used a tubular steel spaceframe and increased the overall weight by about 500 kg to 2,600 kg (5,732 lb). Moving the engine also freed up a large amount of space in the rear, which allowed for enough room to fit 6 more passengers, for a total of 11 occupants.

The wheels on the Marco Polo are standard DeLorean alloys covered by hubcaps. The Marco Polo is not a running prototype, rather the design is only a painted plastic model for aerodynamic research. The Lamborghini badge on the nose of the car was not to imply any design program undertaken with the factory but was a compliment paid by Giugiaro to the famous manufacturer that became noteworthy for pushing the limits of automotive design. Although Lamborghini has a more exciting image to its products, Giugiaro decided to give this study a less aggressive line, preferring instead to focus on aerodynamic efficiency in order to provide a quieter passenger compartment and higher speed while maintaining fuel consumption.",

  "/wiki/Diesel_engine": "The diesel engine (also known as a compression-ignition or CI engine), named after Rudolf Diesel, is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to the mechanical compression (adiabatic compression). This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine (gasoline engine) or gas engine (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol), which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. Diesel engines work by compressing only the air. This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites spontaneously. With the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion, the dispersion of the fuel is uneven; this is called a heterogeneous air-fuel mixture. The torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air-fuel ratio (\u03bb); instead of throttling the intake air, the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected, and the air-fuel ratio is usually high. The diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency (engine efficiency) of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air. A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared with two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust.",
