  "/wiki/Set_(mathematics)": "In mathematics, a set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.

Beginning in the late 19th century, this concept was generalized to infinite sets, allowing to distinguish several stages of infinity, and to perform arithmetic on them. There are two approaches to cardinality \u2013 one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.\nThe cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of size is possible.",

For example, if we consider the action of the special linear group SLn on the space of n by n matrices by left multiplication, then the determinant is an invariant of this action because the determinant of A X equals the determinant of X, when  A is in SLn.",

Conversely, a projective algebraic plane curve of homogeneous equation h(x, y, t) = 0 can be restricted to the affine algebraic plane curve of equation h(x, y, 1) = 0.
