  "/wiki/Second_Taranaki_War": "The Second Taranaki War is a term used by some historians for the period of hostilities between M\u0101ori and the New Zealand Government in the Taranaki district of New Zealand between 1863 and 1866. The term is avoided by some historians, who either describe the conflicts as merely a series of West Coast campaigns that took place between the Taranaki War (1860\u20131861) and Titokowaru's War (1868\u201369), or an extension of the First Taranaki War.\n The conflict, which overlapped the wars in Waikato and Tauranga, was fuelled by a combination of factors: lingering M\u0101ori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale land confiscation policy launched by the government in late 1863; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai Marire syncretic religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity. The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki M\u0101ori in the absence of individual M\u0101ori commanders.\n The style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860-61 conflict, in which M\u0101ori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest. From 1863 the army, working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery, systematically took possession of M\u0101ori land by driving off the inhabitants, adopting a \"scorched earth\" strategy of laying waste to M\u0101ori villages and cultivations, with attacks on villages, whether warlike or otherwise. As the troops advanced, the Government built an expanding line of redoubts, behind which settlers built homes and developed farms. The effect was a creeping confiscation of almost a million acres (4,000 km\u00b2) of land, with little distinction between the land of loyal or rebel M\u0101ori owners.\n The Government's war policy was opposed by the British commander, General Duncan Cameron, who clashed with Governor Sir George Grey and offered his resignation in February 1865. He left New Zealand six months later. Cameron, who viewed the war as a form of land plunder, had urged the Colonial Office to withdraw British troops from New Zealand and from the end of 1865 the Imperial forces began to leave, replaced by an expanding New Zealand military force. Among the new colonial forces were specialist Forest Ranger units, which embarked on lengthy search-and-destroy missions deep into the bush.\n The Waitangi Tribunal has argued that apart from the attack on Sentry Hill in April 1864, there was an absence of M\u0101ori aggression throughout the entire Second War, and that therefore M\u0101ori were never actually at war. It concluded: \"In so far as M\u0101ori fought at all \u2013 and few did \u2013 they were merely defending their kainga, crops and land against military advance and occupation.\"",
  "/wiki/Charles_Heaphy": "Charles Heaphy VC (1820 \u2013 3 August 1881) was an English-born New Zealand explorer and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest military award for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first soldier of the New Zealand armed forces to be awarded the VC. He was also a noted artist and executed several works of early colonial life in New Zealand.\n Born in England, Heaphy joined the New Zealand Company in 1839. He arrived in New Zealand later that year and was commissioned to create art for advertising the country to potential English migrants.  Much of the next two and half years was spent travelling and executing paintings of landscapes and life around the centre of the country. When his contract with the company ended in 1842, he lived in Nelson for several years and explored large parts of the West Coast. He later moved north to Auckland to take up employment as a surveyor.\n During the Invasion of the Waikato, his militia unit was mobilised and it was his conduct at Paterangi, where he rescued British soldiers under fire, that saw him awarded the VC. As well as being the first soldier of New Zealand armed forces to receive the VC, he was the first recipient to be a militiaman. After his military service ended, Heaphy served a term as Member of Parliament for Parnell. From 1870 to 1881, he held a variety of civil service positions. In his later years, his health declined and he retired from public service in May 1881. He moved to Queensland, in Australia, seeking a better climate in which to recover his health but died a few months after his arrival. He is buried at Toowong Cemetery in Brisbane.",
  "/wiki/Invasion_of_Waikato": "The Invasion of the Waikato was the biggest and most important campaign of the 19th century New Zealand Wars, fought in the North Island of New Zealand between the military forces of the colonial government and a federation of M\u0101ori tribes known as the \"Kingitanga Movement\". The Waikato is a territorial region with a northern boundary somewhat south of the city of Auckland.  Hostilities lasted for nine months, from July 1863 to April 1864. The invasion was aimed at crushing Kingite power, which was seen as a threat to British authority, and also at driving Waikato M\u0101ori from their territory in readiness for occupation and settlement by Europeans. The campaign was fought by a peak of about 14,000 Imperial and colonial troops and about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors drawn from more than half the major North Island tribal groups.\n Plans for the invasion were drawn up at the close of the First Taranaki War in 1861 but were opposed by the Colonial Office and New Zealand General Assembly and suspended by incoming Governor Sir George Grey in December of that year. Grey reactivated the invasion plans in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a violent raid on Auckland by Kingite M\u0101ori. Grey used as the trigger for the invasion Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all M\u0101ori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River. Troops crossed into Waikato territory three days later and launched their first attack on 17 July at Koheroa, but were unable to advance for another 14 weeks.\n The subsequent war included the Battle of Rangiriri\u2014which cost both sides more men than any other engagement of the New Zealand Wars\u2014and the three-day-long Battle of \u014cr\u0101kau, probably the best-known engagement of the New Zealand Wars and which inspired two films called Rewi's Last Stand. The campaign ended with the retreat of the Kingitanga M\u0101ori into the rugged interior of the North Island and the confiscation of about 12,000 km2 of M\u0101ori land.\n The defeat and confiscations left the King Movement tribes with a legacy of poverty and bitterness that was partly assuaged in 1995 when the government conceded that the 1863 invasion and confiscation was wrongful and apologised for its actions. The Waikato\u2013Tainui tribe accepted a compensation of cash and some government-controlled lands totalling about $171 million\u2014about 1 percent of the value of the lands confiscated in 1863\u2014and later that year Queen Elizabeth II personally signed the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995.

  "/wiki/First_Taranaki_War": "The First Taranaki War (also known as the North Taranaki War) was an armed conflict over land ownership and sovereignty that took place between M\u0101ori and the New Zealand Government in the Taranaki district of New Zealand's North Island from March 1860 to March 1861.\n The war was sparked by a dispute between the government and M\u0101ori landowners over the sale of a property at Waitara, but spread throughout the region. It was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia, as well as volunteer soldiers and militia, against M\u0101ori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500. Total losses among the imperial, volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238, while M\u0101ori casualties totalled about 200, although the proportion of M\u0101ori casualties was higher.\n The war ended in a ceasefire, with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other. Although there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result. Historian James Belich has claimed that the M\u0101ori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them, and had therefore been victorious. But he said the M\u0101ori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the Waikato.\n In its 1996 report to the Government on Taranaki land claims, the Waitangi Tribunal observed that the war was begun by the Government, which had been the aggressor and unlawful in its actions in launching an attack by its armed forces. An opinion sought by the tribunal from a senior constitutional lawyer stated that the Governor, Thomas Gore Browne, and certain officers were liable for criminal and civil charges for their actions. The term \"First Taranaki War\" is opposed by some historians, who refer only to the Taranaki Wars, rejecting suggestions that post-1861 conflict was a second war. The 1927 Royal Commission on Confiscated Land also referred to the hostilities between 1864 and 1866 as a continuation of the initial Taranaki war.",

  "/wiki/List_of_New_Zealand_Wars_Victoria_Cross_recipients": "The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 15 recipients for action during the New Zealand Wars. The VC is a military decoration awarded for valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The award was officially constituted when Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856, which was gazetted on 5 February 1856.  The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War.\n Originally, the VC was not available to colonial troops, even if under British command, but this changed in 1867. The extension was made following a recommendation for gallantry regarding colonial soldier Major Charles Heaphy for action in the land wars in 1864.  He was operating under British command and the VC was gazetted in 1867. Later that year, the Government of New Zealand assumed full responsibility for operations but no further recommendations for the Victoria Cross were raised for local troops who distinguished themselves in action. Following gallant actions by three New Zealand soldiers in November 1868 and January 1869 during the land wars, an Order in Council on 10 March 1869 created a \u201cDistinctive Decoration\u201d for members of the local forces without seeking permission from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Although the Governor was chided for exceeding his authority, the Order in Council was ratified by the Queen. The title \u201cDistinctive Decoration\u201d was later replaced by the title New Zealand Cross.\n The New Zealand Wars were a series of conflicts that took place in New Zealand between 1845 and 1872. The two conflicts where soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross were the First Taranaki War of 1860\u20131861 and the Waikato-Hauhau M\u0101ori War of 1863\u20131866. The First Taranaki War was fought over land rights on New Zealand's North Island. The local Colonial Governor had set up a policy whereby the British Government could buy local land, and anyone refusing to sell their land would be committing treason against the Crown. When the Te Atiawa refused to sell their land, the British Army attacked on 17 March 1860, starting the First Taranaki War. After a series of sieges by the British, a truce was signed with the M\u0101ori people in March 1861; the disputed land became British-owned territory but it remained in possession of the M\u0101ori people. The First Taranaki War ended in a stalemate over the one area of disputed land. By 1863 the influx of settlers and consequent demand for land led to further conflict. In July 1863, the British Army and the Auckland Militia launched the Invasion of Waikato against the forces of T\u0101whiao and the M\u0101ori King Movement. The British expelled the M\u0101ori people from their lands, swiftly moving south, culminating in the defeat and flight of T\u0101whiao at \u014cr\u0101kau in March 1864. The British pursued him across the country as far as the fourth Waikato defensive line, which later became the border of King Country."
