  "/wiki/Savage_Dragon": "Savage Dragon is a fictional superhero created by Erik Larsen, published by Image Comics and taking place in the Image Universe. The comic features the adventures of a superheroic police officer named the Dragon. The character first appeared as Dragon in Graphic Fantasy #1 (June 1982) and first appeared as the Savage Dragon in Megaton #3 (February 1986). The Dragon is a large, finned, green-skinned humanoid whose powers include super-strength and an advanced healing factor. He is also an amnesiac: his earliest memory is awakening in a burning field in Chicago, Illinois. Thus, for most of the series, the origins of his powers and appearance are a mystery to readers. At the beginning of the series, he becomes a police officer and battles the mutant criminal superfreaks that terrorize Chicago. Savage Dragon is one of only two Image Comics titles that debuted during the company's 1992 launch that continues to be published well into the late 2010s, and the only one of the two that for most of its run, has been written and drawn almost entirely by its creator (with the exception of one issue), for which Larsen has been lauded. Savage Dragon is the longest running American full-color comic book to feature a single artist/writer. [citation needed] The character was also adapted into an animated series, which ran for two seasons (26 episodes) on the USA Network beginning in 1995. Savage Dragon was listed by Wizard as the 116th-greatest comic book characters of all time.
