  "/wiki/NBA_Finals": "The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Eastern and Western conference champions play a best-of-seven game series to determine the league champion. The winners of the Finals are awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, which replaced the Walter A. Brown Trophy in 1983.\n The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949\u201350 season when the Basketball Association of America (BAA) merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the NBA. The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985, as well as a brief stint as the Showdown, before settling on NBA Finals in 1986. Since 2018, it has been officially known as the NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV for sponsorship reasons.\n The NBA Finals was initially structured in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format. In 1985, to ease the amount of cross-country travel, it was changed to a 2\u20133\u20132 format, where the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. In 2014, the 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format was restored. The first two games are played the higher-seeded team's home, the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team, and the remaining three are played at each team's home arena alternately.\n A total of 19 franchises have won the NBA Finals, with the Toronto Raptors winning in 2019. The Boston Celtics hold the record for the most victories, having won the competition 17 times, as well as the most consecutive titles, winning 8 times from 1959 to 1966. The Los Angeles Lakers have contested the NBA Finals the most times, with 31 appearances. The Eastern Conference has provided the most champions, with 38 wins from 10 franchises; the Western Conference has 32, from 9 franchises.",

In the 1972 NBA Draft, the Braves selected Bob McAdoo, who later won such awards as Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player.

In their 45-year history they have never been to a Western Conference Finals, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history.

After drafting Elvin Hayes first overall in the 1968 NBA Draft, they made their first appearance in the playoffs in 1969. After Hayes was traded, Moses Malone replaced him. Malone won two Most Valuable Player awards during his time in Houston, and led the Rockets to the 1977 Eastern Conference finals in his first year with the Rockets. He also led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, but they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics. Two years after advancing to the finals, the Rockets won a franchise-low 14 games.\n In 1984, the Rockets drafted future Hall-of-Famer Hakeem Olajuwon, who led them to the 1986 Finals in his second year, in which they lost again to Boston.

Going into the series the matchup was compared to the Bill Russell\u2013Wilt Chamberlain matchup of the 1960s.\n The Rockets became the first team in NBA history to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship. The Rockets would win a playoff-record nine road games in the 1995 playoffs. It was the second NBA Finals sweep in the 2\u20133\u20132 Finals format (after the Detroit Pistons did so against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1989). The Rockets also became the first repeat NBA Champion in history to keep the title with a sweep. In addition, the Rockets became the first team in NBA history to win the title without having home-court advantage in any of the four playoff rounds since the playoffs was expanded to a 16 team format in 1984. Coincidentally, this feat would also be achieved by the New Jersey Devils that same year, when they won the Stanley Cup over the Detroit Red Wings.\n The Orlando Magic (making their first ever NBA Finals appearance) began the 1995 NBA Finals at home, hosting the defending champion Houston Rockets.

The more experienced Rockets went on to win in overtime and eventually swept the Magic, winning their second consecutive NBA Championship. In achieving this, they earned the distinction of being the only team to win both championships during Michael Jordan's first retirement (although Jordan did return in the closing months of the 1994\u201395 season), as well as the only one outside Chicago to win multiple championships in the 1990s.\n The season-ending documentary Double Clutch by Hal Douglas, was released by NBA Entertainment to coincide with the Rockets' championship season.",

In 2000\u201301 the Iverson-led 76ers won fifty-six games and defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals to reach the 2001 Finals but lost to the Lakers four games to one in the best-of-seven series. The 76ers were a middle-of-the-road team on-court during the following dozen seasons, but by the early 2010s financial problems led incoming general manager Sam Hinkie to clean out any expensive players in order to save money and gain draft choices for the future. Lacking on-court talent, the 76ers set many records for ineptitude in the following three seasons, becoming the second NBA team after the 1995\u201396 to 1998\u201399 Grizzlies to suffer three consecutive seasons winning fewer than twenty games. In 2015\u201316 by going 10\u201372 the 76ers suffered the ignominy of having suffered the two all-time worst 82-game NBA season winning percentages.[note 1]",
  "/wiki/2001_NBA_Finals": "The 2001 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2000\u201301 season. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers took on the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers for the championship, with the Lakers holding home-court advantage in a best-of-seven format.\n The Lakers won the series 4 games to 1. Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal was named the Most Valuable Player of the series.\n Allen Iverson scored 48 points in his only NBA Finals victory, as the 76ers took Game 1 107\u2013101 in overtime, handing the Lakers their only loss of the playoffs. However, the Lakers went on to win the next four games, despite being out-shot and out-rebounded in the series. Los Angeles punished Philadelphia with their three-point shooting, which was the key to this series. In Game 3 Robert Horry hit a three-point shot in the last minute, and in the next two games the Lakers used hot 3-point shooting to build big leads and hold off late 76ers comeback attempts in games 4 and 5, pulling away for double-digit wins to win the title.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Brooklyn_Nets_seasons": "This is a list of seasons completed by the Brooklyn Nets professional basketball team. The Nets were founded as the New Jersey Americans in 1967, a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA). A year later, the team moved to Long Island, New York, and were renamed as the New York Nets. There, behind the play of Hall of Famer Julius Erving, the team won its only two ABA championships: in 1974 and 1976. After the 1975\u201376 season, the ABA merged with the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Nets were one of four franchises that joined the NBA. After a season of being the second team to represent the state of New York (the other being the New York Knicks), the team moved back to New Jersey as the New Jersey Nets.\n In the NBA, the Nets have experienced only one period of sustained success, from the 2001\u201302 season to the 2006\u201307 season, when led by Jason Kidd they played in the postseason every year and twice reached the NBA Finals, but lost to Shaquille O'Neal-led Los Angeles Lakers in 2002 and then to Tim Duncan-led San Antonio Spurs in 2003.

  "/wiki/2003_NBA_Finals": "The 2003 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2002\u201303 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs played the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets for the title, with the Spurs holding home court advantage. The series was played under a best-of-seven format. The Spurs defeated the Nets to win the series 4\u20132. Spurs' forward Tim Duncan was named the Most Valuable Player of the championship series. The series was broadcast on U.S. television on ABC, with Brad Nessler, Bill Walton, and Tom Tolbert announcing.\n The 2003 Finals documentary was narrated by Rodd Houston, who later narrated three other NBA Finals series.\n This was the first NBA Finals since 1995 to use the traditional script font in its logo; in the intervening years, a more contemporary all-gold logo had been used with the Larry O'Brien Trophy, as well as the year and the series' name encompassed by an oval on a black background.\n The series featured controversy about Tim Duncan getting a quadruple double in game 6.[citation needed] On Duncan's stat sheet, he had 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, and 8 blocks. However, in the third quarter, there were two instances of Duncan potentially getting a block but they were not called.[citation needed] The first instance was of Duncan blocking a shot before the ball traveled out of bounds before another player touched it.[citation needed] A block was not called. The second instance came just 2 minutes later, with Duncan blocking another shot, this time with the ball not going out of bounds.[citation needed] However, the block was credited to David Robinson.[citation needed] Looking at the video of the block, Duncan's hand appears to touch the ball before Robinson's.[citation needed] As of 2019[update], no change has been made to the stat sheet, and Duncan was not credited with a quadruple double.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/List_of_Detroit_Pistons_seasons": "This is a list of seasons completed by the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association. The franchise was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons in the National Basketball League and as the Fort Wayne Pistons joined the Basketball Association of America, which was the precursor to the NBA. However, the games won and lost in the NBL are not included in the franchise total.\n The Pistons have had three main periods of success. In the early years of the NBA the team reached the NBA Finals twice in consecutive years before falling to the Lakers and then to the St. Louis Hawks. Following an extended era of mediocrity the Pistons, led by the Hall of Fame backcourt of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and nicknamed the \"Bad Boys\" for their intimidating defence, posted winning records every seasons from 1983\u201384 to 1991\u201392, and after narrowly losing in 1988, ended the Lakers dynasty of the 1980s the following season and repeated the following year. The Pistons\u2019 third period of success, with former on-court star Dumars serving as general manager and building a top team from other franchises\u2019 discards, occurred between 2001\u201302 and 2007\u201308 when the team won fifty games or more during every season, including a third NBA title in 2003\u201304 and a franchise record total of wins two seasons later.\n The Pistons have experienced two major periods of failure. Between 1956\u201357 and 1982\u201383, the Pistons had just three winning seasons and overall had a winning percentage of .417, culminating in a combined record of 37\u2013127 (win percent .226) in the 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381 seasons, after which the drafting of Isiah Thomas completely revitalized the franchise. Since 2009\u201310, the Pistons have only once finished out of the bottom two in their division or had a winning record. In the six seasons starting in 2009\u201310 the franchise had an overall record of 172 wins from 476 games or a winning percentage of .361.",
  "/wiki/2005_NBA_Finals": "The 2005 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2004\u201305 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs.

  "/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_droughts": "This is a list of National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise post-season appearance droughts. This list includes the all-time and the active consecutive non-playoffs. Aside from the NBA playoff appearance droughts, this list also includes droughts of series wins, appearances in the NBA Finals and NBA championship wins. The oldest such franchise is the Suns (51 seasons), while the Royals/Kings and the Hawks have even longer championship droughts (68 and 61 seasons, respectively). Six franchises have never been to the NBA Finals, the highest number among the major North American sports. The oldest such team is the Braves/Clippers franchise (49 seasons); the Kings and the Hawks have appearance droughts that are even longer (69 and 59 seasons, respectively). The longest a franchise has gone without appearing in the playoffs at all is 15 seasons: the Braves/Clippers franchise from 1977 to 1991.\n Of the 19 franchises that have won an NBA championship, 8 have droughts of 36 seasons or more, which is to say that the past 36 championships have been shared among only 11 franchises: the Lakers (8), Bulls (6), Spurs (5), Celtics (3), Pistons (3), Heat (3), Warriors (3), Rockets (2), Mavericks (1), Cavaliers (1), and Raptors (1). By contrast, the other three major North American sports have each had at least 16 franchises become champions over the same period of time."
