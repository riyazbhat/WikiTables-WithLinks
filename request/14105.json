  "/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics": "The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event that was held from July 28 to August 12, 1984, in Los Angeles, California, United States (and other venues around the United States). This was the second time that Los Angeles had hosted the Games, the first being in 1932.\n California was the home state of then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who officially opened the Games. The logo for the 1984 Games, branded \"Stars in Motion\", featured red, white and blue stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks.\nThe official mascot of the Games was Sam the Olympic Eagle. These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch.\n The 1984 Games were boycotted by a total of fourteen Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union and East Germany, in response to the American-led boycott of the previous 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; Romania was the only Eastern Bloc nation that opted to attend the Games. Iran and Libya also chose to boycott the Games for unrelated reasons. Despite the field being depleted in certain sports due to the boycott, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time. The United States won the most gold and overall medals, followed by Romania and West Germany.\n The 1984 Summer Olympics are widely considered to be the most financially successful modern Olympics and served as an example of how to run the model Olympic Games. As a result of low construction costs, coupled with a reliance on private corporate funding, the 1984 Olympic Games generated a profit of more than $250\u00a0million.\n On July 18, 2009, a 25th anniversary celebration was held in the main Olympic Stadium. The celebration included a speech by the former president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, Peter Ueberroth, and a re-creation of the lighting of the cauldron. Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics for the third time in 2028.",
  "/wiki/Boxing_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics": "Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place in the Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California, United States. The boxing schedule began on July 29 and ended on August 11. Twelve boxing events were contested with the participation of 354 fighters from 81 countries.  A Soviet-led boycott resulted in the withdrawals of the Soviet Union, Cuba, East Germany, Bulgaria and other Eastern Bloc nations from boxing competitions.\n At the 1980 Summer Olympics, that was impacted by an American-led boycott, Cuban boxers won 10 medals, with 6 of them being gold, and had again been expected to do well. However, the nation withdrew from the games following the announcement of the Soviet boycott. Te\u00f3filo Stevenson, who was going to try for his fourth Olympic gold medal before the boycott was officially announced, had previously defeated Tyrell Biggs twice (one by knockout) and Hermenegildo B\u00e1ez had previously defeated Henry Tillman. Soviet Alexander Yagubkin defeated both Biggs and Tillman during the USA\u2013USSR duals. Cuban and Soviet boxers, however, were more seasoned than their American counterparts. While US athletes typically turned pro after the Olympics, while still in their early twenties, Cubans and the Soviets were not allowed to do so and stayed on in the amateurs, participating in multiple Olympic cycles. Journalist George Vecsey remarked after the conclusion of the games that \"Despite all the flag-waving euphoria in the United States over all those medals in Los Angeles, the Summer Games were a made-in-Disneyland reproduction of the Games because there were no Soviet runners, no Cuban boxers, no East German swimmers.\" Soviet runners and East German swimmers decades later were revealed to have been part of their respective nations' state-sponsored doping schemes.\nEvander Holyfield was controversially disqualified in the semifinals for punching Kevin Barry after what seemed to be a stop. However, on a replay it is seen that the referee stopped the bout after his punches. Under IABA health regulation Barry was not allowed to box for 28 days, so he scratched from the final. During the medal ceremony, gold medalist Anton Josipovi\u0107 shared the highest step of the podium with Holyfield and raised his hand, thus acknowledging that Evander deserved to be in the final.",

There were a total of 43 participating athletes. The three qualifying heats were held on August 5, followed by the two semi-finals on August 6. The final was held on August 8, 1992.\n This field was stacked with the world championship podium of Algerian Hassiba Boulmerka with Tetyana Dorovskikh and Lyudmila Rogachova, who had represented the Soviet Union, but after the demise of that political entity just over eight months earlier were representing the \"Unified Team.\"  Other key competitors look to be '84 silver medalist / 800 metre gold medalist Doina Melinte, and the wild card of 800 meter specialist Maria Mutola moving up in distance.  Another wild card were two young Chinese athletes, 21 year old Liu Li and 19 year old Qu Yunxia who had qualified for the final.  While the Soviet Union had virtually owned the event for the previous two decades, the Chinese had no history in this event.  In the World Championships the previous year, the only, token, Chinese representative finished dead last in her qualifying heat.\n This was not going to be a slow tactical final.  Rogachova went to the front, quickly marked by Melinte and a third former Soviet, double 1983 medalist Yekaterina Podkopayeva.  Left behind at the line, Liu rushed forward on the outside, chased by Boulmerka.  In dead last place, Qu had to work her way around PattiSue Plumer and Mutola who had dropped back expecting to pick up the pieces with her finishing kick.  Dorovskikh rushed to join the party at the front, followed by Qu who had a noticeably less refined running style, rocking from side to side, looking strained.  Boulmerka aggressively stuck behind Rogachova at the front, the only one to break up the Unified former Soviet bloc at the front of the pack.  700 metres into the race, Qu rocked her way past Melinte and Liu onto third place Podkopayeva's back.  As the two leaders started to break, Qu followed onto Boulmerka's back.  With a lap to go, the field had strung out.  Only the remaining green Unified team members were able to struggle to hold on to the three leaders with a gap back to Plummer and Mutola leading the second group.  As she was falling back through the field, Melinte walked off the track at the end of the third lap.  Mutola launched into what would be a long final kick, but after leaving Plummer, she wasn't making any headway.  Down the backstretch, Boulmerka made her one move, accelerating past Rogachova.  Rogachova couldn't answer, just holding her same speed.  Dorovskikh stuck to Qu's back and made her move for bronze off the final turn.  Qu looked at her and sprinted away gaining rapidly on Rogachova toward the finish.  Boulmerka celebrated, flexing her muscles while the rest of the field looked exhausted.  A little over a year later, Qu would set the world record that would last for 22 years.",

  "/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics": "The 1996 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, commonly known as Atlanta 1996, and also referred to as the Centennial Olympic Games, were an international multi-sport event that was held from July 19 to August 4, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. These Games, which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States, marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens\u2014the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games. They were also the first since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics, under a new  IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating, even-numbered years.\n More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports, including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball, mountain biking, and softball, as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing and women's football (soccer). 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debut in Atlanta, including eleven former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations. The hosting United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals, and the most gold (44) and silver (32) medals out of all countries. The U.S. topped the medal count for the first time since 1984, and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics. Notable performances during competition included those of Andre Agassi\u2014who became the first men's singles tennis player to combine a career Grand Slam with an Olympic gold medal, Donovan Bailey\u2014who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men's 100 meters, and Lilia Podkopayeva\u2014who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics.\n The festivities were marred by violence on July 27, when Eric Rudolph detonated pipe bombs at Centennial Olympic Park\u2014a downtown park that was built to serve as a public focal point for the Games' festivities, killing 1 and injuring 111. In 2003, Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related attacks on abortion centers and a gay bar, and was sentenced to life in prison. He claimed that the bombing was meant to protest the U.S. government's sanctioning of \"abortion on demand\".\n The Games turned a profit, helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights, and reliance on private funding (as opposed to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics), among other factors. The Games faced criticism for being overly commercialized, as well as other issues noted by European officials, such as the availability of food and transport. The event had a lasting impact on the city; Centennial Olympic Park led a revitalization of Atlanta's downtown area and has served as a symbol of the Games' legacy, the Olympic Village buildings have since been used as residence housing for area universities, and the Centennial Olympic Stadium has been re-developed twice since the Games\u2014first as the baseball park Turner Field, and then as the college football venue Georgia State Stadium.",

Approaching the bell at the end of the third lap, Morceli had moved into the lead with El Guerrouj sprinting up to his shoulder.  Morceli held him off with El Guerrouj having to cede position and move in behind Morceli squeezing in front of defending champion, master tactician Fermin Cacho who was perfectly positioned directly behind Morceli.   Two strides later El Guerrouj tripped and fell.  Morceli took off sprinting at the same moment the rest of the field had to evade El Guerrouj's body on the track.

This was the first time that China had hosted the Summer Olympics, but the third time that the Games had been held in East Asia, following the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and the Seoul 1988 Summer Olympics. These were the second summer Olympic Games staged in a Communist country, after the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics and the third in a developing country after the Mexico City 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union and the first overall Olympics to be hosted by a Communist state since the former Yugoslavia hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.\n Beijing was awarded the 2008 Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting. The Government of the People's Republic of China promoted the Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transport systems. A total of 37 venues were used to host the events, including twelve constructed specifically for the 2008 Olympics. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making this the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs.[c] The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.\n The official logo for the 2008 Games, titled \"Dancing Beijing\", featured a stylised calligraphic character j\u012bng (\u4eac, means capital) in reference to the host city. The Beijing Olympics was watched by 3,500,000,000 people worldwide and featured the longest distance for an Olympic Torch relay. The event sets numerous world and Olympics records in the history of sports, and is also the most expensive Summer Olympics of all time and second-most expensive overall, after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular and spellbinding, and by many accounts \"the greatest ever in the history of Olympics\".\n An unprecedented 87 countries won at least one medal during the Games. China won the most gold medals, with 48, and became only the seventh different team to top an overall Olympic medal tally, winning a total of 100 medals overall. The United States placed second in the gold medal tally but won the highest number of medals overall, with a total of 112. The third place in the gold medal tally was achieved by Russia.\n Beijing has been selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympics; it will become the first city ever to host both a Summer and Winter Games.",

Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.",

  "/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics": "The 2012 Summer Olympics, formally the Games of the XXX Olympiad and commonly known as London 2012, was an international multi-sport event that was held from 27 July to 12 August 2012 in London, United Kingdom. The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, followed by the opening ceremony on 27 July. 10,768 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated.\n Following a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city on 6 July 2005 during the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris. London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times, having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and in 1948.\n Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability. The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site at Stratford, East London. The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.\n The Games received general praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm praised particularly highly. The opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim throughout the world, particular praise from the British public and a minority of widely ranging criticisms from some social media sites. During the Games, Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, so that every currently eligible country has sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games. Women's boxing was included for the first time, thus the Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and host Great Britain. Several world and Olympic records were set at the games. Though there were several controversies, the 2012 games were deemed highly successful with the rising standards of competition amongst nations across the world, packed stadiums and smooth organisation. Furthermore, the focus on sporting legacy and post-games venue sustainability, much like the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, was seen as a blueprint for future Olympics.",

Men competed in 24 events and women in 23, of which 21 were the same for both.

The first race was the fastest, taking all but one of the time qualifiers into the semi-final.  Andrew Wheating's 3:40.92 in the second heat was the slowest time qualifier, though it was exactly equal to Nick Willis' winning time in the last race.  That race was broken up when Nixon Chepseba tripped sending several athletes scrambling to avoid the falling body.  Chepseba ultimately finished 9th but was awarded a place in the semi-final on appeal, though no offending athlete was disqualified.\n The first semi final was strategic from the start, when the sprinting started, Taoufik Makhloufi easily took the lead and held the position.  Since it was strategic, no time qualifiers came from this semi.  In the other semi, Chepseba took it out at a faster pace, to avoid getting caught in traffic.  At the 800 mark, Nathan Brannen fell flat and was not able to get back into contention.  When the sprinting started, Abdalaati Iguider looked to be the fastest.  The slowest time qualifier was almost 7 seconds faster than Makhloufi winning the first.\n Earlier on the day before the final, Makhloufi was also in an 800 metres qualifying round race, but he ran slowly and dropped out.  Because of the \"honest effort\" rule, he was disqualified from further competition in the Olympics.  It took an appeal by Algerian team officials to get him re-instated by claiming he had a known knee injury.\n In the final, Makhloufi made a miraculous recovery from the injury in order to run.  Kenyan Chepseba, and Kenyan born Bahraini Belal Mansoor Ali ran shoulder to shoulder until 600 to go when Chepseba then decided to take the lead solo.  Behind him runners were three abreast, with Makhloufi and Silas Kiplagat trading elbows to be in position for the final lap.  Another elbow just before 300 to go, and Makhloufi broke away with Kiplagat and Mekonnen Gebremedhin in hot pursuit.  With Makhloufi gone, 8 meters ahead, Gebremedhin took over second at the head of the stretch, Iguider sprinting a step behind.  Five meters further back, Leonel Manzano was starting to sprint around teammate Matthew Centrowitz, Jr..  As Iguider was edging ahead of Gebremedhin, Manzano was rocketing along the outside passing into second 30 meters from the finish.   Iguider just barely managed to finish a fraction ahead of the fast closing Centrowitz for the bronze medal.",

Great Britain finished second and became only the second country in modern Olympic history to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after it had been host nation. China finished third. Host country Brazil won seven gold medals, its largest tally at any single Summer Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place.
