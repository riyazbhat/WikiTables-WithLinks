  "/wiki/Christian_denomination": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organization, leadership and doctrine. The Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy, meaning the large majority, all self-describe as churches, whereas many Protestant denominations self-describe as congregations or  fellowships. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, ecclesiology, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations\u2014often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties\u2014are sometimes known as \"branches of Christianity\". These branches differ in many ways, especially through differences in practices and belief.",
