  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales, according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in. Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones, but some alternative scales also exist, such as accumulated cyclone energy, the Power Dissipation Index, the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index, and the Hurricane Severity Index.",
  "/wiki/1927_Pacific_typhoon_season": "In 1927, there were 27\u00a0tropical cyclones observed in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the 180th meridian. Many of these storms affected the Philippines, China, and Japan, collectively leaving 15,952\u00a0fatalities. The strongest storm of the year also had the lowest barometric pressure recorded in a tropical cyclone worldwide at the time. On August\u00a018, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded a barometric pressure of 886.7\u00a0millibar (26.185\u00a0inches of mercury) about 740\u00a0kilometres (460\u00a0miles) east of Luzon. This typhoon later struck near Hong Kong, where it halted transportation, wrecked buildings, and killed 15\u00a0people.",
  "/wiki/1949_Pacific_typhoon_season": "The 1949 Pacific typhoon season is an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season runs throughout 1949, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100\u00b0E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\u00a0(PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.",

  "/wiki/1951_Pacific_typhoon_season": "The 1951 Pacific typhoon season was a generally below average season with multiple tropical cyclones striking the Philippines. With the exception of January, each month saw at least one tropical system develop; October was the most active month with four tropical cyclones forming. Overall, there were 21\u00a0tropical depressions, of which 17\u00a0became named storms; of those, there were 16\u00a0typhoons.",

  "/wiki/Typhoon_Ida_(1958)": "Typhoon Ida, also known as the Kanogawa Typhoon (\u72e9\u91ce\u5ddd\u53f0\u98a8, Kanogawa Taif\u016b), was the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit Japan, as well as one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record. On September\u00a020, Ida formed in the Western Pacific near Guam. It moved to the west and rapidly intensified into a 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) typhoon by the next day. On September\u00a022, Ida turned to the north and continued its quick rate of intensification. Two days later, the Hurricane Hunters observed a minimum barometric pressure of 877\u00a0mb (25.9\u00a0inHg), as well as estimated peak winds of 325\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph). This made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone on record at the time, although it was surpassed by Typhoon June 17\u00a0years later. Ida weakened as it continued to the north-northeast, and made landfall in Japan on southeastern Honsh\u016b with winds of 80\u00a0mph on September\u00a026. It became extratropical the next day, and dissipated on the 28th to the east of the country. Ida caused torrential flooding to southeastern Japan, resulting in over 1,900\u00a0mudslides. Damage was estimated at $50\u00a0million, and there were 1,269\u00a0fatalities.",

The storm's intensity resulted in catastrophic damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country.",

The system possibly had the strongest winds ever measured in a tropical cyclone, tied with Hurricane Patricia of 2015.

  "/wiki/Typhoon_Karen": "Typhoon Karen was the most powerful tropical cyclone to strike the island of Guam, and has been regarded as one of the most destructive events in the island's history. It was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November\u00a06, 1962, well to the southeast of Truk. Over the following two days, the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified. Karen became a tropical storm late on November\u00a07, and within two days it explosively intensified into a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Turning westward, the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) on November\u00a011. Once clear of the island, it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November\u00a013 with winds of 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 894\u00a0mb (hPa; 26.40\u00a0inHg). The storm then gradually turned northward as it weakened, brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November\u00a015, before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific. Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November\u00a017 before losing its identity the following day between Alaska and Hawaii.",
  "/wiki/1964_Pacific_typhoon_season": "The 1964 Pacific typhoon season  was the most active tropical cyclone season recorded globally, with a total of 39 tropical storms forming.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.",
  "/wiki/List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones": "Winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds. However, variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult. In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damages, and tornadoes can vary significantly in storms with similar wind speeds. Pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because the measurements are easier and use consistent methodology. Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth. However, although there is a strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds, storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds, as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different."
