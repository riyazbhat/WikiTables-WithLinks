  "/wiki/Colby_College": "Colby College is a private liberal arts college in Waterville, Maine. Approximately 1,800 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually.  The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors. It was founded in 1813 as the Maine Literary and Theological Institution until it was renamed after the city it resides in with Waterville College. The donations of Christian philanthropist Gardner Colby saw the institution renamed again to Colby University before concluding on its final and current title, reflecting its liberal arts college curriculum.\n Located in central Maine, the 714-acre Neo-Georgian campus sits atop Mayflower Hill and overlooks downtown Waterville and the Kennebec River Valley. Along with fellow Maine institutions Bates College and Bowdoin College, Colby competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. Colby is ranked as the 11th best (tied) liberal arts in the country according to U.S. News & World Report and is ranked 61st among all institutions of higher learning according to Forbes.",
  "/wiki/Baptist": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and doing so by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or aspersion). Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency (the responsibility and accountability of every person before God), sola fide (salvation by faith alone), sola scriptura (scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice) and congregationalist church government. Baptists generally recognize two ordinances: baptism and communion.\n Diverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship.\n Historians trace the earliest \"Baptist\" church to 1609 in Amsterdam, Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have freedom of religion. Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States.   Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent.",

The sorority has initiated 172,000 members, has 122 collegiate chapters, and has over 110 alumnae chapters. It is officially partnered with the Maine Sea Coast Mission to raise money for the Mission's programs, and it also includes gerontology with an emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and research its other initiatives. \n The sorority is one of 26 members of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) of national women's fraternities, joining the conference in 1904.",

The five women were the only female students at Colby at that time. Colby was the first New England college to allow the admittance of women.\n Being the only women in the college, the five of them found themselves together frequently. In 1873-74, the five young women decided to form a literary and social society. They were instructed by the college administration that they would need to present a constitution and bylaws with a petition requesting permission to form Sigma Kappa Sorority. They began work during that year and on November 9, 1874, the five young women received a letter from the faculty approving their petition. They sought for and received permission to form a sorority with the intent for the organization to become national.\n Hoag was described as an only child, happy and joyous, who was very artistic and wrote musical plays. She lived with her widowed mother and her Quaker grandmother, who frequently found it necessary to say, \"Thee talks too much, Elizabeth.\" Since Hoag's mother was the organist for the village church, Mary Caffrey Low knew her prior to Colby. \n Born in 1857, she was 17 when she entered Colby College. She was a conscientious student who loved languages and literature but found math to be drudgery. She literally had to memorize her textbooks on that subject. Hoag designed the first Sigma Kappa emblem.\n Hoag had tuberculosis and during the winter of her sophomore year, she grew sicker. The four other founders knew she would not live long and worked hard to prepare for their first initiation on February 17, 1875 so that Hoag could see her cousin, Emily Peace Meader, initiated. (Meader wrote much of Sigma Kappa's initiation music.) Late in March, Louise Coburn received this little note: \"Adored Goody, I've gin' out. I shan't brighten our pleasant retirement with my presence this week anyway.\" It was signed, \"An Imp still.\" Hoag lingered through the spring and died June 8, 1875, at the age of 18. Elizabeth was mourned not only by her sorority sisters, but also by her whole class. They voted to wear mourning bands until the end of the school term in July. \n Sigma Kappa now celebrates Founders' Day every November 9, in honor of the five women who created the organization.",

Her brother Blin, upset that she would dare try to attend a men's school, refused to attend Colby if she went. Although Fuller men had always attended Colby, Blin went to Bowdoin College instead. At the college, Fuller found a natural set of friends with the only other women attending the school. She was said to contribute to the forming of Sigma Kappa with her practical ideas and nature.\n After leaving Colby in her junior year, Fuller went to Kansas to seek a drier climate.  In Kansas, she met and married Dr. Pierce. In later years, after his death, she became a successful businesswoman, founded a hotel for girls in Kansas City, and was vice-president of a bank.\n Fuller helped her niece Abby Fuller, Blin's daughter, to found the Xi chapter of Sigma Kappa at the University of Kansas. Both her nieces attended the University of Kansas, and Ida May served as the university Sigma Kappa chapter's housemother for several years.\n A loyal convention attender, Ida May was always willing to travel to Sigma Kappa functions and was present at the 1924 Golden Jubilee Convention.\n Fuller died September 26, 1930 and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Eureka, Kansas.",

She felt she needed better training for her profession. Hall was slightly older than the other women but was still in her early 20s.\n Having to go to chapel to get a mark, Hall was late one day and had to wait for all the men to come out. It was an embarrassing moment. Hall said afterwards, all she saw was the floor, but all one young man, George Washington Hall, saw was Frances. When his friends asked him what ailed him, he replied, \"I've just seen my wife.\" Frances had to leave college her junior year, as Ida Fuller did also, because of astigmatic headaches. She married George, and they went teaching together. Hall was the first Sigma Kappa to be married.\n Frances attended the 1928 Convention in Washington, D.C. and the Saranac Convention in 1933. At Saranac, she was a faithful attendant at all functions, even the Mission program which began at midnight.\n Reportedly, her last message before her death in 1935   was, \"Take my love to all the chapters.

  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches (also Congregationalist churches; Congregationalism) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance, in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs.\n Congregationalism, as defined by the Pew Research Center, is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism, as well as other Christian congregations. The report defines it very narrowly, encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom, which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants, Puritans, Separatists, Independents, English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War, and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed.\n Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and various island nations in the Pacific region. It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society. A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship.\n In the United Kingdom, many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582. Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s. Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches. In England, the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians, whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders. Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance, which is usually led by a bishop.\n Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England, who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others. Within the United States, the model of Congregational churches was carried by migrating settlers from New England into New York, then into the Old North West, and further. With their insistence on independent local bodies, they became important in many social reform movements, including abolitionism, temperance, and women's suffrage. Modern Congregationalism in the United States is largely split into three bodies: the United Church of Christ, the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches and the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, which is the most theologically conservative.",

Bishop's will established a trust called the \"Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate\" that is Hawai\u02bbi's largest private landowner. Originally established in 1887 as an all-boys school for native Hawaiian children, it shared its grounds with the Bishop Museum. After it moved to another location, the museum took over two school halls. Kamehameha Schools opened its girls' school in 1894. It became coeducational in 1965.

Since 1965 it has excluded all but two non-Hawaiians from being admitted. A lawsuit challenging the school's admission policy resulted in a narrow victory for Kamehameha in the Ninth Circuit Court; however, Kamehameha ultimately settled, paying the plaintiff $7 million.\n As of the 2011\u201312 school year, Kamehameha had an enrollment of 5,398 students at its three main campuses and 1,317 children at its preschools, for a total enrollment of 5,416.
