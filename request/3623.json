Construction of the dam, which began in 1956 and ended in 1958, was authorized by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The dam was constructed to raise the water level of the river because the upstream Hoover and Davis Dams blocked sediment, causing significant degradation of the riverbed that hampered water diversion.\n The dam diverts about 1,800 cubic feet (51 m3) of water per second to irrigate 121,000 acres (490 km2) of the Palo Verde Valley and mesa lands on the west side of the Colorado River in California. The headworks of the diversion canal consists of four 12 feet (3.7 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) pipes, while the spillway is a gated structure consisting of three 50 feet (15 m) long gates separated by 8 feet (2.4 m) thick piers.
