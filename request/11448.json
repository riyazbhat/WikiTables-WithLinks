He has total sales of over 21\u00a0million singles in the United Kingdom and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history, behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley.\n Richard was originally marketed as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Elvis Presley and Little Richard. With his backing group, the Shadows, Richard dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s to early 1960s. His 1958 hit single \"Move It\" is often described as Britain's first authentic rock and roll song; in the opinion of John Lennon of the Beatles, \"before Cliff and the Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music\". Increased focus on his Christianity and subsequent softening of his music led to a more middle-of-the-road image and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music.\n Over a career spanning 60 years, Richard has amassed many gold and platinum discs and awards, including two Ivor Novello Awards and three Brit Awards. More than 130 of his singles, albums and EPs have reached the UK Top 20, more than any other artist. Richard has had 67 UK top ten singles, the second highest total for an artist behind Elvis. Richard holds the record (with Elvis) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950s\u20132000s). He has achieved 14 UK number-one singles, and is the only singer to have had a number-one single in the UK in five consecutive decades.\n Richard has never achieved the same popularity in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles, including the million-selling \"Devil Woman\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore\". In Canada, he had a successful period in the early 1960s, and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with some releases certified gold and platinum. He has remained a popular music, film, and television personality in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Northern Europe and Asia, and retains a following in other countries. Richard has been a resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life, though in 2010, he confirmed that he had become a citizen of Barbados.

The Python parody song was part of the \"Europolice Song Contest\" sketch in the \"How To Recognize Different Parts of the Body\" episode in 1970.\n Lyrically, the song is a plea from the singer to her lover to \"cuddle me tight\". She then goes on to explain that \"my heart goes boom bang-a-bang boom bang-a-bang when you are near\", complete with appropriate musical accompaniment. The single made No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart and was a major hit throughout Europe.\n The song was succeeded as the winner in 1970 by Dana singing \"All Kinds of Everything\" for Ireland.\n Over two decades after its first release, the song was included on a blacklist of banned songs issued by the BBC during the 1991 Gulf War.\n \"Boom Bang-A-Bang\" was also the name of a BBC One 1-hour programme made to celebrate 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006.

Originally, as with 1973, Cilla Black's 1974 nine-part BBC series was scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe' process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series' run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show. This necessitated a truncating of the regularly established format of the chosen artist performing one song a week on the given series, so it was planned that Newton-John would perform two songs a week for three weeks once the series started. However, a BBC strike led to the cancellation of the first show, so another revision was needed and Olivia performed three songs a show over two programmes.

His choice was met with a negative response by the UK media, the song writing community and the general public. Members of the group were responsible for two of the six shortlisted songs, causing a further outcry from the music publishers associations. The Shadows performed one song a week for six weeks on the BBC1 TV series Lulu, hosted by 1969 Eurovision joint winner Lulu. Uniquely, although the group were seen performing weekly, in fact they only recorded one performance of each of the six songs in December 1974, for a special edition of the series broadcast on 15 February 1975. These performances were then shown individually for the six week period, before being shown back-to-back in the final, followed by an immediate repeat of all six. Viewers cast votes via postcard for their favourite song and the winning entry announced on 22 February was Let Me Be The One which received 17,477 votes, the lowest published figure known for a winning song in the UK finals that used either voting by mail or telephone. The choice of The Shadows led to calls from the Music Publishers Association for the songwriters and composers to be allowed to select the artist of their choice to perform the songs in future UK selections for Eurovision and the low postal vote persuaded the BBC that a new format was indeed needed. This was inaugurated in 1976. The winning song was written by Paul Curtis, who won the Song for Europe contest another three times, making him the most successful writer in the history of the UK selection process.

  "/wiki/UK_national_selection_for_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest": "Eurovision: You Decide is the most recent name of a BBC television programme that was broadcast annually to select the United Kingdom's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest. The show had previously gone under several other names, including Festival of British Popular Songs (1957), Eurovision Song Contest British Final (1959\u20131960), The Great British Song Contest (1996\u20131999), Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up (2004\u20132007), Eurovision: Your Decision (2008), and Eurovision: Your Country Needs You (2009\u20132010), but was known, for most of its history, as A Song for Europe (1961\u20131995, 2000\u20132003).\n The selection process, originally broadcast on BBC One, has varied between selecting both the performer and song, or just the song in some years. For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected.\n The most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would return and be called Eurovision: You Decide and broadcast on BBC Four.\n On 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that Eurovision: You Decide would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on BBC Two. The format returned in 2018 and 2019, again broadcast live on BBC Two. The national selection shows have been hosted by a variety of presenters over the years. Mel Giedroyc has hosted since its return in 2016, being joined by co-host M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w from 2018 onwards. The You Decide format was scrapped in September 2019 and an internal selection is to be used for the UK's 2020 participation, with BBC Studios and music company BMG collaborating in order to find the entry which will then be released and published by BMG."
