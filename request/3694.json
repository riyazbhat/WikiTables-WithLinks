  "/wiki/Bill_O'Reilly_(political_commentator)": "William James O'Reilly Jr. (born September 10, 1949) is an American journalist, author, and former television host. During the late 1970s and 1980s, he reported for local television stations in the United States and later for CBS News and ABC News. He anchored the tabloid television program Inside Edition from 1989 to 1995. O'Reilly joined the Fox News Channel in 1996 and hosted The O'Reilly Factor until 2017. The O'Reilly Factor was the highest-rated cable news show for 16 years, and he was described by media analyst Howard Kurtz as the biggest star in the 20 year history at Fox News at the time of his departure. He is the author of numerous books and hosted The Radio Factor (2002-2009). Since 2017, he has hosted the No Spin News podcast which he founded after being fired from Fox. O'Reilly is considered to be a conservative commentator. O'Reilly's media career took a major blow after several New York Times investigations revealed that he had paid six women nearly $50 million to settle various sexual harassment lawsuits. After the first New York Times investigation revealed that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five sexual harassment lawsuits totaling $13 million, Fox News terminated O'Reilly's employment in April 2017. In October 2017, The New York Times reported an additional settlement of $32 million that O'Reilly had paid to settle a sixth sexual harassment lawsuit which had been filed against him by former Fox News analyst Lis Wiehl because of the non-consensual sexual relationship she says O'Reilly initiated with her. The revelation of this sixth settlement caused O'Reilly to be dropped by the United Talent Agency.",

  "/wiki/Mad_Men": "Mad Men is an American period drama television series created by Matthew Weiner and produced by Lionsgate Television. The series ran on the cable network AMC from 2007 to 2015, lasting for seven seasons and 92 episodes. Its fictional time frame runs from March 1960 to November 1970. Mad Men is set initially at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, and later at the newly created firm of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (later named Sterling Cooper & Partners), located near the Time-Life Building at 1271 Sixth Avenue. According to the pilot episode, the phrase Mad men was a slang term coined in the 1950s by advertisers working on Madison Avenue to refer to themselves, Mad being short for Madison. (In reality, the only documented use of the phrase prior to the series may have been in the late-1950s writings of James Kelly, an advertising executive and writer.) The series' main character is the womanizing advertising executive Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm), who is initially the talented creative director at Sterling Cooper, and later a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. The plot tracks the people in his personal and professional lives. As the series progresses, it depicts the changing moods and social mores of the United States throughout the 1960s. Mad Men won critical acclaim for its writing, acting, directing, visual style, and historical authenticity; it won many awards, including 16 Emmys and 5 Golden Globes. The show was also the first basic cable series to receive the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning the award each year of its first four seasons (2008-2011).
