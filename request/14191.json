  "/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen": "The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, also called the Arab coalition (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u200e), is an intervention launched by Saudi Arabia in 2015, leading a coalition of nine countries from West Asia and Africa, in response to calls from the internationally recognized pro-Saudi president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi for military support after he was ousted by the Houthi movement due to economic and political grievances, and fled to Saudi Arabia. Code-named Operation Decisive Storm (Arabic: \u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0645\u200e Amaliyyat '\u0100\u1e63ifat al-\u1e24azm), the intervention is said to be in compliance with Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by the international community; but this has been contested by some academics. The intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign on Houthi rebels and later a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition has attacked the positions of the Houthi militia, and loyalists of the former President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, allegedly supported by Iran (see Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia proxy conflict). Fighter jets and ground forces from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Academi (formerly Blackwater) took part in the operation. Djibouti, Eritrea, and Somalia made their airspace, territorial waters, and military bases available to the coalition. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support, including aerial refueling and search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots. It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states and continued strikes against AQAP.",
  "/wiki/Al-Qaeda": "Al-Qaeda (/\u00e6l\u02c8ka\u026ad\u0259, \u02cc\u00e6lk\u0251\u02d0\u02c8i\u02d0d\u0259/; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629\u200e al-Q\u0101\u02bfidah, IPA: [\u00e6lq\u0251\u02d0\u0295\u026ad\u0250], translation: The Base, The Foundation, alternatively spelled al-Qaida and al-Qa'ida) is a militant Salafist Islamist multi-national organization founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and several other Arab volunteers during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists. The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and various other countries (see below). Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries, including the 1998 United States embassy bombings, the September 11 attacks, and the 2002 Bali bombings. The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror, which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies. The deaths of key leaders, including that of Osama bin Laden, have led al-Qaeda's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators. Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets. Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden, or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq or Sudan."
