  "/wiki/Spanish_solution": "In railway and rapid transit parlance, the Spanish solution is a station layout with two railway platforms, one on each side of the track.

  "/wiki/Paid_area": "In rail transport, the paid area is a dedicated \"inner\" zone in a railway station or metro station barriers, which visitor or passenger requires a valid ticket, checked smartcard or a pass to get in.

A paid area usually exists in rapid transit railway stations for separating the train platform from the station exit, ensuring a passenger has paid or prepaid before reaching the platform and using any transport service. Such design requires a well-organized railway station layout.",
