  "/wiki/KL_Sentral": "Kuala Lumpur Sentral (KL Sentral) or Stesen Sentral Kuala Lumpur is a transit-oriented development that houses the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Opened on 16 April 2001, KL Sentral replaced the old Kuala Lumpur railway station as the city's main intercity railway station. KL Sentral is the largest railway station in Malaysia.\n KL Sentral is designed as an intermodal transport hub. All of Kuala Lumpur's passenger rail lines except the Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines serve KL Sentral, while many intercity trains serving Peninsular Malaysia start there. All the railway components of the scheme have been completed, and NU Sentral shopping mall is located here. It was also designed to be a new business and financial hub for Kuala Lumpur.",
  "/wiki/Spanish_solution": "In railway and rapid transit parlance, the Spanish solution is a station layout with two railway platforms, one on each side of the track. This platform arrangement allows the separation of passenger streams by using one platform only for boarding and the other one only for alighting. The concept of separate platforms for boarding and alighting has been proven effective at stations with high passenger numbers.",
  "/wiki/Paid_area": "In rail transport, the paid area is a dedicated inner zone in a railway station or metro station barriers, which visitor or passenger requires a valid ticket, checked smartcard or a pass to get in. A system using paid areas is often called fare control. Passengers are allowed to enter or exit only through a faregate. A paid area usually exists in rapid transit railway stations for separating the train platform from the station exit, ensuring a passenger has paid or prepaid before reaching the platform and using any transport service. Such design requires a well-organized railway station layout. The paid area is similar in concept to the airside at an airport. However, in most cases entrance to the paid area requires only a valid ticket or transit pass. The exception is in certain cases of international rail travel, where passengers must also pass through immigration control and customs to enter the paid area.",
