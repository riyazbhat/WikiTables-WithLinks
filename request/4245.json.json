Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1961 after Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Royal Navy, leader of the Discovery expedition (1901\u201304) and the British Antarctic Expedition (1910-13), who lost his life on the return journey from the South Pole. Much of the early exploration of this coastline was accomplished by Scott and his colleagues, and many of the names in the region were bestowed by him.",
  "/wiki/Alph_River": "Alph River is a small river of Antarctica, running into Walcott Bay, Victoria Land. It is in an ice-free region at the west of the Koettlitz Glacier, Scott Coast. The Alph emerges from Trough Lake, and flows through Walcott Lake, Howchin Lake, and Alph Lake. It ends in a sub-glacial flow beneath Koettlitz Glacier to McMurdo Sound.",
  "/wiki/Don_Juan_Pond": "Don Juan Pond is a small and very shallow hypersaline lake in the western end of Wright Valley (South Fork), Victoria Land, Antarctica, 9 kilometres (5.6\u00a0mi) west from Lake Vanda. It is wedged between the Asgard Range to the south and the Dais Range to the north. On the west end is a small tributary and a rock glacier. With a salinity level of 33.8%, Don Juan Pond is the saltiest of the Antarctic lakes and the second saltiest body of water on earth behind the Gaet'ale Pond. This salinity allows the pond to remain liquid even at temperatures as low as \u221250\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221258\u00a0\u00b0F) due to the interference of salts with the bonding of water molecules.",

  "/wiki/Endorheic_lake": "An endorheic basin (also endoreic basin or endorreic basin) is a limited  drainage basin that normally retains water and allows no outflow to other external bodies of water, such as rivers or oceans, but converges instead into lakes or swamps, permanent or seasonal, that equilibrate through evaporation. Such a basin may also be referred to as a closed or terminal basin or as an internal drainage system or interior drainage basin.",

Hoare, a member of the VUWAE that examined lakes in Taylor, Wright, and Victoria Valleys.",
  "/wiki/Lake_Vanda": "Lake Vanda is a lake in Wright Valley, Victoria Land, Ross Dependency, Antarctica. The lake is 5\u00a0km long and has a maximum depth of 69\u00a0m. On its shore, New Zealand maintained Vanda Station from 1968 to 1995. Lake Vanda is a hypersaline lake with a salinity more than ten times that of seawater, more than the salinity of the Dead Sea, and perhaps even more than of Lake Assal (Djibouti), which is the world's most saline lake outside of Antarctica. (Previous sentence, however, is not true according to List of bodies of water by salinity). Lake Vanda is also meromictic, which means that the deeper waters of the lake don't mix with the shallower waters. There are three distinct layers of water ranging in temperature from 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) on the bottom to the middle layer of 7\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F) and the upper layer ranges from 4\u20136\u00a0\u00b0C (39\u201343\u00a0\u00b0F). It is only one of the many saline lakes in the ice-free valleys of the Transantarctic Mountains. The longest river of Antarctica, Onyx River, flows West, inland, into Lake Vanda. There is a meteorological station at the mouth of the river.",
