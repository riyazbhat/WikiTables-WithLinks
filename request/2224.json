With 72 years of radio and television runs, Guiding Light is the longest running soap opera, ahead of General Hospital, and is the fifth-longest running program in all of broadcast history; only the American country music radio program Grand Ole Opry (first broadcast in 1925), the BBC religious program The Daily Service (1928), the CBS religious program Music and the Spoken Word (1929), and the Norwegian children's radio program L\u00f8rdagsbarnetimen (1924-2010) have been on the air longer.[a]\nGuiding Light was created by Irna Phillips, and began as an NBC Radio serial on January 25, 1937. On June 2, 1947, the series was transferred to CBS Radio, before starting on June 30, 1952, on CBS Television. It continued to be broadcast concomitantly on radio until June 29, 1956.

  "/wiki/Island_City_(1994_film)": "Island City is a science fiction television pilot movie that was aired by Prime Time Entertainment Network in 1994. The film was produced by Lee Rich Productions in association with Lorimar Television. It is the last TV film to be produced by Lorimar after the company shut down in 1993.\n In the future, humanity develops a \"fountain of youth\" drug, but as many people around the world begin to take it, most begin to mutate into a barbaric proto-humanoid state. The few people immune to this side-effect of the drug band together and live in a futuristic city while the mutants live in the vast wasteland outside its gates. In an effort to save the human race and understand what went wrong, the city sends out research missions in fortified vehicles to bring back mutated humans for research, and to rescue healthy humans. The film focuses on one such squad of soldiers and scientists.\n During one of their missions into the wasteland, the team comes under attack and one of their own is captured by the mutants. The rest of the movie, which was meant to serve as an introductory episode of a series, deals with the main characters coping with the loss of their friend and organizing a search-and-rescue mission, while secondary characters allow the viewer to explore various facets of life in the city.\n The movie touches on many themes including genetic experimentation, virtual reality, and state-controlled marriages. Citizens of the city wear a colored crystal on their sternum based on the individual's genetic makeup, and can mate only with other citizens of the same color. Progeny resulting from people of two different colors would have the genetic mutation that, when combined with the \"fountain of youth\" drug, created the race of proto-humanoids.\n Another plot line focuses on the morality of a \"fountain of youth\" drug. One of the lead female roles is married to a man who did not take the drug because he believed it immoral. Her husband has aged normally into his 60s or 70s while his wife remains physically and visually in her mid 30s.\n The film features virtual reality goggles. The son of the missing soldier uses the goggles to study and do his history homework, and also to spend time fishing with his father. He also attempts to fulfill his sexual fantasies, but a parental block prevents his fantasy girl from removing her top.\n Due to low ratings and the high costs associated with producing a sci-fi television show, no other episodes were filmed.",

In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom, which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television, radio, and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n CBS formerly operated the CBS Radio network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with Entercom.

The series initially focuses on the three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano). Following Prue's death in the third-season finale, their long-lost half sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan) assumes her place within the \"Power of Three\" from season four onwards.\n Charmed achieved a cult following and popularity on The WB with its first episode \"Something Wicca This Way Comes\" garnering 7.7\u00a0million viewers, breaking the record for the network's highest-rated debut episode. The show's ratings, although smaller than rival shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB network.
