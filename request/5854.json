However, both Kerry and Cavan were disqualified for fielding illegal players. This meant that Mayo were declared champions without the need for a final. However, in the meantime, Galway had defeated Mayo in the Connaught final and this put the GAA in a bind. They withdrew their nomination of Mayo to represent Connaught, and chose Galway as rightful Connaught champions. Thus, Galway became All-Ireland champions.\n However, this was deemed unsatisfactory by all. The GAA Central Council organised a substitute competition, with Galway taking the rightful place of Connaught champions. However, Kerry complained that their semi-final victory over Cavan should stand in this new competition.
