  "/wiki/1964%E2%80%9365_Yugoslav_First_League": "The 1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League had an odd number of teams because FK Vardar was allowed to compete in the top league despite getting relegated the previous season.

The thinking was that having a team in top-flight would boost the citizens' morale.",

  "/wiki/NK_Zagreb": "Nogometni klub Zagreb (English: Zagreb Football Club), commonly known as NK Zagreb or simply Zagreb (pronounced\u00a0[z\u00e2\u02d0\u0261reb]), is an amateur Croatian football club based in the Croatian capital city of Zagreb, currently playing in the \u010cetvrta HNL Center, which is a fourth tier league competition in the Croatian football league system. The club was founded in 1908 as H\u0160K Zagreb, meaning Hrvatski \u0160portski Klub Zagreb (English: Croatian Athletic Club Zagreb). In 2018 after managing Stadion Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva as their home ground since 1946 for 72 years, NK Zagreb was denied of new managing contract by the city's officials which in the end led to eviction from the venue in October 2018. So, as of 2018\u201319 season NK Zagreb is using their training camp ZAGREBello venue as a home ground for its official fixtures which is located in Vesla\u010dka street. The team's traditional home colours are white shirts, shorts and socks which is the reason why they are referred to as Bijeli in Croatian, meaning \"The Whites\". Another popular nickname of the club is \"The Poets\", Pjesnici in Croatian, due to their former location of home ground at Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva street which is named after Croatian poet Silvije Strahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107.",
