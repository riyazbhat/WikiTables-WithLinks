  "/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes": "Country calling codes or country dial-in codes are telephone number prefixes for reaching telephone subscribers in the networks of the member countries or regions of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The codes are defined by the ITU-T in standards E.123 and E.164. The prefixes enable international direct dialing (IDD), and are also referred to as international subscriber dialing (ISD) codes.\n Country codes are a component of the international telephone numbering plan, and are necessary only when dialing a telephone number to establish a call to another country. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which also indicates to the subscriber that the local international call prefix must first be dialed. For example, the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the North American Numbering Plan is 011, while it is 00 in most European, Asian and African countries. On GSM (cellular) networks, the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign.",
  "/wiki/List_of_international_call_prefixes": "An international call prefix or dial out code is a trunk prefix used to select an international telephone circuit for placing an international call. It is now called an IDD prefix (international direct dialing) \u2013 a country will typically have an NDD prefix as well (national direct dialing). The international dialing prefix must be dialed before the country calling code and the destination telephone number. It is synonymous with international access code or exit code. The international call prefix is part of the telephone numbering plan of a country for calls to another country. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommends the sequence 00 as a standard for an international call prefix, and this has been implemented by most countries, but not all of them. Some countries use the 00 prefix which is followed by the international carrier code. When phone numbers are published for use abroad, they typically show a plus sign (+) prefix in place of any international call prefix, to signify that the caller should use the prefix code appropriate for their country.",
