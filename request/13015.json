  "/wiki/Ketch": "A ketch is a two-masted sailboat whose mainmast is taller than the mizzen mast (or aft-mast),  generally in a 40-foot or bigger boat. The name ketch is derived from catch. The ketch's main mast is usually stepped in the same position as in a sloop. \n Its sail-plan is similar to that of a yawl, on which the mizzen mast is smaller and set further back. The addition of headsails can makes a cutter-ketch.  \nIn New England, in the 1600s the ketch was a small coastal craft. In the 1700s it disappeared from contemporary records, apparently replaced by the schooner.\n A ketch rig has an advantage over a sloop downwind, and in heavy winds where it has more variety of setups than a sloop, but is less efficient than a sloop upwind. Staysails can also be hoisted between the top of the mizzen mast and base of the main mast to help downwind performance, and in heavy winds the mainsail can be dropped altogether leaving the boat stable under foresail and mizzen alone. Dropping the mainsail and operating under mizzen and foresail or even mizzen alone, leaves the central area of the boat free for working without intrusion of the mainsail boom.",

  "/wiki/Trial_Bay": "Trial Bay is a broad bay on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia.  The bay faces northwards and extends from Laggers Point in the east around to Grassy Head to the west, past the town of South West Rocks and the Macleay River mouth.\n The bay is named after the brig Trial which was shipwrecked there in 1816.\n In 1820 John Oxley explored the area.  He reported Port Macquarie as more favourable for settlement than Trial Bay, though Trial Bay might offer an anchorage while waiting for favourable winds to cross the bar at Port Macquarie.\n Trial Bay has a northerly facing and is sheltered from the predominant southerly swells.  There have been various plans over the years to make it a full harbour, protected in all conditions.  Its location in between other sheltered waters of Moreton Bay and Port Stephens recommended such a project.  In the 1880s through to 1900s an attempt at a breakwater was made off Laggers Point.  In the 1960s an oil terminal established near South West Rocks reignited interest in a harbour, but the Department of Public Works concluded the cost would not be warranted. Ships moored in the bay and delivered oil via a pipeline extending approximately 2\u00a0km to the terminal operated by Caltex. The terminal is noted as decommissioned in 2003.\n It was also a major internment camp during WWI.<OutBack Australia Issue 122 Dec 2018/Jan 2019>",

  "/wiki/Cutter_(boat)": "A cutter is generally a small to medium-sized vessel, depending on its role and definition.  Historically, it was a smallish single- or double-masted, decked sailcraft designed for speed rather than capacity.  As such, it was gaff-rigged, with two or more headsails and often a bowsprit of some length, with a mast sometimes set farther back than on a sloop.  While historically a workboat, as used by harbor pilots, the military, and privateers, sailing cutters today are most commonly fore-and-aft rigged private yachts.\n Powered cutters vary in size depending on their function, with small boats for ferrying passengers between larger craft and shore sometimes referred to as cutters, rugged smallish vessels serving the traditional role of delivering harbor pilots, and large ocean-going U.S. Coast Guard or UK Border Force ships referred to as cutters by tradition.\n Open oared cutters were carried aboard 18th century naval vessels and rowed by pairs of men sitting side-by-side on benches.

  "/wiki/HMAS_Adelaide_(FFG_01)": "HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) was the lead ship of the Adelaide class of guided missile frigates built for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), based on the United States Navy's Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates. She was built in the United States and commissioned into the RAN in 1980.\n During her career, Adelaide was part of Australian responses or contributions to the 1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat, the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, the Indonesian riots of May 1998, the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, the War in Afghanistan, and the United States-led invasion of Iraq. In 1997, the frigate rescued two competitors in the 1996\u201397 Vend\u00e9e Globe solo, round-the-world yacht race. In 2001, a boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants was intercepted by Adelaide; the events of this interception became the centre of the Children overboard affair.\n In 2008, Adelaide was the second ship of the class to be decommissioned, in order to offset the cost of an upgrade to the other four vessels. This ship was to be sunk off Avoca Beach, New South Wales as a dive wreck on 27 March 2010, until an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by protest groups led to a postponement of the scuttling until additional cleanup work was completed. Despite further attempts to delay or cancel the scuttling, Adelaide was sunk off Avoca on 13 April 2011.",

The first four vessels were built in the United States, while the other two were constructed in Australia.\n The first ship entered service in November 1980. Canberra and Adelaide were paid off in 2005 and 2008 respectively, and later sunk as dive wrecks: their decommissioning was to offset the cost of a A$1 billion weapons and equipment upgrade to the remaining four ships. Sydney was decommissioned in late 2015, after spending most of the year as a moored training ship. Darwin was decommissioned in late 2017, Newcastle in June 2019 and Melbourne the last in October 2019. The Hobart-class air-warfare destroyers progressively replaced the last four frigates from 2016 onwards.",
  "/wiki/Frigate": "A frigate (/\u02c8fr\u026a\u0261\u0259t/) is a type of warship, having various sizes and roles over time.\n In the 17th century, a frigate was any warship built for speed and maneuverability, the description often used being \"frigate-built\". These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted guns on a single deck or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel). The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the line of battle, although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed.\n In the 18th century, frigates were full-rigged ships, that is square-rigged on all three masts, they were built for speed and handiness, had a lighter armament than a ship of the line, and were used for patrolling and escort. In the definition adopted by the British Admiralty, they were rated ships of at least 28 guns, carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck \u2013 the upper deck \u2013 while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns.\n In the late 19th century (beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies), the armoured frigate was a type of ironclad warship that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat. The term \"frigate\" was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck.\n In modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships, especially as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant convoys. Ship classes dubbed \"frigates\" have also more closely resembled corvettes, destroyers, cruisers and even battleships. Some European navies such as the Dutch, French, German or Spanish ones use the term \"frigate\" for both their destroyers and frigates.[citation needed] The rank \"frigate captain\" derives from the name of this type of ship.",

  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is a type of steam-powered vessel, typically ocean-faring and seaworthy, that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move  (turn) propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s; however, there were exceptions that came before. Steamships usually use the prefix designations of \"PS\" for paddle steamer or \"SS\" for screw steamer (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, \"SS\" is assumed by many to stand for \"steamship\". Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as \"MV\" for motor vessel, so it is not correct to use \"SS\" for most modern vessels.\n As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns, new trade routes opened up. The steamship has been described as a \"major driver of the first wave of trade globalization (1870\u20131913)\" and contributor to \"an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history\".",
