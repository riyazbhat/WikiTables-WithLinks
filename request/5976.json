  "/wiki/Nori": "Nori (\u6d77\u82d4) is the Japanese name for edible seaweed (a sea vegetable) species of the red algae genus Pyropia, including P. yezoensis and P. tenera. It has a strong and distinctive flavor. It is used chiefly in Japanese cuisine as an ingredient to wrap rolls of sushi or onigiri, in which case the term refers to the dried sheets. The finished dried sheets are made by a shredding and rack-drying process that resembles papermaking. They are sold in packs in grocery stores for culinary purposes. Since nori sheets easily absorb water from the air and degrade, a desiccant is needed when storing nori for any significant time.",

Hiroshige is best known for his horizontal-format landscape series The Fifty-three Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d and for his vertical-format landscape series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo. The subjects of his work were atypical of the ukiyo-e genre, whose typical focus was on beautiful women, popular actors, and other scenes of the urban pleasure districts of Japan's Edo period (1603-1868). The popular series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai was a strong influence on Hiroshige's choice of subject, though Hiroshige's approach was more poetic and ambient than Hokusai's bolder, more formal prints. Subtle use of color was essential in Hiroshige's prints, often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and with extensive use of bokashi (color gradation), both of which were rather labor-intensive techniques. For scholars and collectors, Hiroshige's death marked the beginning of a rapid decline in the ukiyo-e genre, especially in the face of the westernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Hiroshige's work came to have a marked influence on Western painting towards the close of the 19th century as a part of the trend in Japonism. Western artists, such as Manet and Monet, collected and closely studied Hiroshige's compositions. Vincent van Gogh even went so far as to paint copies of two of Hiroshige's prints from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo.",

  "/wiki/Bodhidharma": "Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century.

According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the monks of Shaolin Monastery that led to the creation of Shaolin kungfu. In Japan, he is known as Daruma. Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details. [note 1]\n According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a Persian Central Asian or a South Indian [.] the third son of a great Indian king. [note 2]\nThroughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill-tempered, profusely-bearded, wide-eyed non-Chinese person. He is referred as The Blue-Eyed Barbarian (Chinese: \u78a7\u773c\u80e1; pinyin: B\u00ecy\u01cenh\u00fa) in Chan texts. Aside from the Chinese accounts, several popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma's origins. [note 4]\n The accounts also differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Liu Song dynasty (420-479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the Liang dynasty (502-557).

Zen master Fuke) - allegedly ca. 770-840 or 860), also called P'u-k'o, and best known by his Japanese name, Fuke, was a potentially mythical Chinese Ch\u00e1n (Zen) master, monk-priest, wanderer and eccentric, whose existence and many affairs were advanced by the now defunct Fuke Zen or Hotto-ha sect, or sub-sect, of Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism in the 17th or 18th century with the publication of the later-disconfirmed document, the Kyotaku Denki (\u865a\u9438\u4f1d\u8a18), probably first published around 1640. For the komus\u014d (\u865a\u7121\u50e7) monks of the Fuke sect, he was considered the traditional antecedent - at least in spiritual or philosophical terms - of their order, which was formally established in Edo Japan. It is more likely that the ideological roots of the sect derived from the Rinzai poet and iconoclast Ikky\u016b and the monk Shinchi Kakushin (\u5fc3\u5730\u89ba\u5fc3) who traveled to and from China and Japan in the 13th century. Still according to some accounts the sect is simply a more direct derivative of the Rinzai school and its teachings. The few records of Puhua's life and affairs are those accounted, if only briefly, in several East Asian religious or historical references. One of the only credible sources on his life is to be found in the Tang Dynasty Record of Linji, wherein he is portrayed as an obscure student and eventual dharma heir of Panshan Baoji, as well as a friend, colleague, student and/or contemporary of Linji Yixuan, who founded the Linji (\u81e8\u6e08\u5b97 Rinzai) sect in China. This implies that he may have been a real individual, although the legends surrounding him in the Kyotaku Denki which connect him to the Fuke sect have been proven as fabrications created to further the komus\u014ds' benefits under the Tokugawa shogunate. The legends surrounding Puhua were more recently mentioned in the Monumenta Nipponica, R.H. Blyth's A History of Haiku (published in 1963) as well as some of the writings of Osho, along with later publications concerning the Fuke-sh\u016b, the shakuhachi and related topics.
