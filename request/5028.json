In 1930, Ernest Lawrence invented the cyclotron at Berkeley, based on which UC Berkeley researchers along with Berkeley Lab have discovered or co-discovered 16 chemical elements - more than any other university. During the 1940s, Berkeley physicist J. R. Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb, led the Manhattan project to create the first atomic bomb. In the 1960s, Berkeley was particularly noted for the Free Speech Movement as well as the anti-Vietnam War movement led by its students.
