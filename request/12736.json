  "/wiki/Adelaide": "Adelaide (/\u02c8\u00e6d\u0259le\u026ad/ (listen) AD-\u0259-layd) is the capital city of the state of South Australia, and the fifth-most populous city of Australia. The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide.\n Adelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its metropolitan area extends 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches 96\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south.\n Named in honour of Queen Adelaide, consort to King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens, in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga (\"place of the red kangaroo\"). Light's design, now listed as national heritage, set out the city centre in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands.\n Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. Until the post-war era, it was Australia's third-largest city. It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the \"City of Churches\" due to its diversity of faiths. Today, Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. Adelaide's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century.\n As South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of North Terrace and King William Street.",

Carrapateena represents one of the largest copper reserves in Australia and in the world having estimated reserves of 292 million tonnes of ore grading 1.31% copper and 3.64 million oz of gold. It was discovered by explorer and metallurgist Rudie Gomez in 2005. The project was acquired by OZ Minerals in 2011, and the project was referred to the EPBC Act for Federal environmental approval in 2012. Construction of the decline to access the mine commenced in 2016. The mining technique used to extract the ore is sub-level caving.\n The Tjati decline was officially opened in November 2016. The company expected that it would take two years to complete excavation of the decline which is 7.5 kilometres (4.7\u00a0mi) long and descends 600 metres (2,000\u00a0ft). The mine owners also have a signed agreement with the traditional owners of the land, the Kokatha people. The company announced board approval for continued development on 24 August 2017, expecting to spend A$916 million on development before the mine would begin to produce ore in late 2019. The first copper concentrate was produced in December 2019, by which time the mine had cost between $950 million and $980 million.\n Mine life is forecast to be about twenty years. During the construction time for the decline, surface construction continued. This included an accommodation village and airstrip in 2017-2018. They were followed by processing plant, access road and electricity infrastructure from mid-2018 and installation of underground materials handling. The mine site is on Pernatty Station with other infrastructure on Oakden Hills Station. \n Construction of the airstrip was completed in July 2018 with the village providing 550 accommodation rooms completed about a month later.
