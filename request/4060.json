  "/wiki/Accra_Academy": "The Accra Academy was the first private academy to be established in the Gold Coast, present-day Ghana. The academy is one of the foremost secondary educational institutions in Ghana and  operates as a non-denominational day and boarding boys' school, located at Bubuashie, near Kaneshie in the Greater Accra Region. The academy runs courses in business, science, general arts, general agric and visual arts, leading to the award of a West African Senior School Certificate. The academy' s founders provided tuition to students who wanted a secondary-grade education but who did not have financial support to enable them do so. Dr. Kofi Konuah periodically travelled to some of the major towns in each region of the country to organise entrance examinations for students, so as to offer the brilliant but needy among them the opportunity of education in the Accra Academy. The academy does not offer special admission to brilliant but needy students but, as per a 2005 directive from the Ghana Education Service, admits its students through a school selection placement system. The academy admits both local and foreign students. The academy was established as a private secondary educational institution in 1931 and gained the status of a Government-Assisted School in 1950.",
  "/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)": "State schools, called public schools in North America and many other countries,[note 1] are generally primary or secondary schools mandated for or offered to all children without charge, funded in whole or in part by taxation.\n While such schools are to be found in virtually every country, there are significant variations in their structure and educational programs. State education generally encompasses primary and secondary education (kindergarten to twelfth grade, or equivalent), as well as post-secondary educational institutions such as universities, colleges, and technical schools that are funded and overseen by government rather than by private entities. The position before there were government-funded schools varied: in many instances there was an established educational system which served a significant, albeit often elite, sector of the population; these systems were often funded by religious institutions. The introduction of government-organised schools was in some cases able to build upon this established system, and often both systems have continued to exist, sometimes in a parallel and complementary relationship and other times less harmoniously.",
  "/wiki/Single-sex_education": "Single-sex education, also known as single-gender education and gender-isolated education, is the practice of conducting education with male and female students attending separate classes, perhaps in separate buildings or schools. The practice of single-sex schooling was common before the 20th century, particularly in secondary and higher education. Single-sex education in many cultures is advocated on the basis of tradition as well as religion, and is practiced in many parts of the world. Recently, there has been a surge of interest and establishment of single-sex schools due to educational research. Single-sex education is practiced in many Muslim majority countries; while in other parts of the world it is most popular in Chile, Israel, South Korea, and English-speaking countries such as Singapore, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Australia. In the Western world, single sex education is primarily associated with the private sector, with the public (state) sector being overwhelmingly mixed sex; while in the Muslim world the situation is the opposite: public schools are usually single sex, while many private schools are mixed sex. Motivations for single sex education range from religious ideas of sex segregation to beliefs that the sexes learn and behave differently, and, as such, they thrive in a single sex environment. In the 19th century, in Western countries, single sex girls' finishing schools, and women's colleges offered women a chance of education at a time when they were denied access to mainstream educational institutions.",

  "/wiki/Accra": "Accra (/\u0259\u02c8kr\u0251\u02d0/;Akuapem & Asante Twi: Nkran) is the capital of Ghana covering an area of 225.67 km2 (87.13 sq mi) with an estimated urban population of 2.27 million as of 2012[update]. It is organized into 12 local government districts \u2013 11 municipal districts and the Accra Metropolitan District, which is the only district within the capital to be granted city status. \"Accra\" usually refers to the Accra Metropolitan Area, which serves as the capital of Ghana, while the district which is within the jurisdiction of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly is distinguished from the rest of the capital as the \"City of Accra\". In common usage, however, the terms \"Accra\" and \"City of Accra\" are used interchangeably. The intersection of the Lafa stream and Mallam junction serves as the western border of Accra, the Great Hall of the University of Ghana forms Accra's northern border, while the Nautical College forms the eastern border. The Gulf of Guinea forms the southern border. Formed from the merger of distinct settlements around British Fort James, Dutch Fort Cr\u00eavecoeur (Ussher Fort), and Danish Fort Christiansborg as Jamestown, Usshertown, and Christiansborg respectively, Accra served as the capital of the British Gold Coast between 1877 and 1957 and has since transitioned into a modern metropolis. The capital's architecture reflects this history, ranging from 19th-century colonial architecture to modern skyscrapers and apartment blocks.",

  "/wiki/Boarding_school": "A boarding school provides education for pupils who live on the premises, as opposed to a day school. The word \"boarding\" is used in the sense of \"room and board\", i.e. lodging and meals. As they have existed for many centuries, and now extend across many countries, their function and ethos varies greatly. Traditionally, pupils stayed at the school for the length of the term; some schools facilitate returning home every weekend, and some welcome day pupils. Some are for either boys or girls while others are co-educational. In the United Kingdom, which has a more extensive history of such schools, many independent (private) schools offer boarding, but likewise so do a few dozen state schools, many of which serve children from remote areas. In the United States, most boarding schools cover grades seven or nine through grade twelve\u2014the high school years.",

  "/wiki/Private_school": "An independent school is independent in its finances and governance. Also known as private schools, non-governmental, privately funded, or non-state schools, they are not administered by local, state or national governments. They are usually not dependent upon national or local government to finance their financial endowment. They are typically governed by a board of governors which is elected independently of government, and has a system of governance that ensures its independent operation. Children who attend private schools may be there because they are dissatisfied with public schools in their area. They may be selected for their academic prowess, or prowess in other fields, or sometimes their religious background. Private schools retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students for tuition, rather than relying on taxation through public (government) funding; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship, lowering this tuition fee, dependent on a student's talents or abilities (e.g. sport scholarship, art scholarship, academic scholarship), need for financial aid, or tax credit scholarships that might be available.",

  "/wiki/Mixed-sex_education": "Mixed-sex education, also known as mixed-gender education, co-education or coeducation (abbreviated to co-ed or coed), is a system of education where males and females are educated together. Whereas single-sex education was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate. The world's oldest co-educational school is thought to be Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School, Croydon, established in 1714 in the United Kingdom, which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards. This has always been a day school only. The world's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is Dollar Academy, a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland, United Kingdom.
