  "/wiki/Brooke_Site": "The Brooke Site (designated 33DE3) is an archaeological site in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located south of the city of Defiance in Defiance County, the site encompasses approximately 1 acre (0.40 ha) at the bottom of a ravine, along the Auglaize River.  It was occupied by Late Woodland peoples of the Ontario and Younge Traditions.\n Archaeology students from Defiance College took part in field schools at the site during the summers of 1968 through 1973.  Excavations conducted by these field schools resulted in the discovery of a wide range of artifacts, such as bits of flint, bone, and pottery, a midden, fire pits, and a piece of copper.  Although only half of the site was excavated by these field schools, the knowledge gained was significant because it highlighted the connection between the different peoples who occupied the site, and because the excavations revealed the inhabitants' varying seasonal uses of the site.\n In 1976, the Brooke Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance.",
  "/wiki/Auglaize_River": "The Auglaize River (Shawnee: Kathinakithiipi) is a 113-mile-long (182 km) tributary of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio in the United States. It drains a primarily rural farming area in the watershed of Lake Erie. The name of the river comes from the French word for glaise (clay). The French called it \"rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 la Grande Glaize\" (river of Great Clay).\n It rises in southeastern Allen County, approximately 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Lima and 12 miles (19 km) north of Indian Lake. It flows southwest to Wapakoneta, then generally north in a zigzag course, past Delphos, Fort Jennings and Oakwood. It joins the Maumee from the south at Defiance, approximately 2 miles (3 km) east of the mouth of the Tiffin River at 41\u00b017\u203213\u2033N 84\u00b021\u203223\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff41.286893\u00b0N 84.356527\u00b0W\ufeff / 41.286893; -84.356527.\n It receives the Ottawa River from the southeast in western Putnam County, northwest of Lima. It also receives the Blanchard River in western Putnam County. It receives the Little Auglaize River from the south in eastern Paulding County. It receives Flatrock Creek from the west in northeastern Paulding County.\n During the days of the Ohio Country in the 18th century, the area around the river was inhabited by the Ottawa. During the mid-1790's the area near the mouth of the Auglaize surpassed Kekionga to the west as the center of Indian influence. Fort Defiance was constructed in 1794 near the confluence of the Auglaize and the Maumee by General Mad Anthony Wayne. Fort Amanda, constructed along the river southwest of Lima in 1812, was an important American outpost during the War of 1812.",

  "/wiki/Dey_Road_Bridge": "The Dey Road Bridge is a historic truss bridge that spans the Tiffin River near the city of Defiance, Ohio, United States.  Built in the 1900s, it has been designated a historic site.\n In 1835, an early toll bridge across the Tiffin was built at the nearby community of Brunersburg, but it was soon destroyed by a flood.  The current bridge is a Pratt through truss bridge that was manufactured by the Massillon Bridge Company and built in 1906.  Built on concrete supports, it is constructed primarily of iron.  In 1907, it became a local landmark for surveying purposes when a USGS surveyor placed a benchmark on its northwestern abutment.\n In 1999, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant engineering.  By that time, the bridge was vacant and not in use.  Now known as the \"Old Dey Bridge\", the bridge is closed to road traffic, although pedestrians are still permitted to use it.  The bridge is one of several locations included as points of interest on a proposed Defiance city strategic plan.",

  "/wiki/Fort_Defiance_(Ohio)": "Fort Defiance was built by General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne in the second week of August 1794 at the confluence of the Auglaize and Maumee rivers. It was the one of a line of defenses constructed by American forces in the campaign leading to the Northwest Indian War's Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.\n Work began on August 9, 1794 and was completed by August 17. The name was derived from a declaration by Charles Scott, who was leading a band of Kentucky militiamen in support of Wayne, that: \"I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils of hell to take it.\"  The post was considered one of the strongest fortifications built in that period.\n Following the Battle of Fallen Timbers, Wayne ordered the destruction of all Native American villages and their crops within a 50-mile (80 km) radius of the fort. Under terms of the Treaty of Greenville, signed on August 3, 1795, the native nations ceded six square miles around the fort and allowed the Americans to maintain a trading post there, even though it was within the area of land defined by the \"Greenville Treaty Line\", beyond which Americans had agreed not to settle. The fort was abandoned in 1796.\n Fort Winchester was constructed on a nearby site in 1812 by Gen. William Henry Harrison.\n The city of Defiance, Ohio, was founded at the fort's location in 1822. In 1904, the site of the fort was chosen for the Defiance Public Library.\n Fort Defiance served as a reference point for defining the boundary line of land cession in the Treaty of Detroit in 1807.  This north-south line would be used again as the Michigan Meridian in the survey of lands in Michigan.\n Today, a park occupies the site of the fort, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.",
