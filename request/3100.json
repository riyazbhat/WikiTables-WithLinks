  "/wiki/Nicholas_and_Alexandra": "Nicholas and Alexandra is a 1971 British biographical film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and written by James Goldman, based on Robert K.

  "/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin": "Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (/r\u00e6\u02c8spju\u02d0t\u026an/; Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0415\u0444\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d [\u0261r\u02b2\u026a\u02c8\u0261or\u02b2\u026aj j\u026a\u02c8f\u02b2im\u0259v\u02b2\u026at\u0255 r\u0250\u02c8sput\u02b2\u026an]; 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869 \u2013 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916) was a Russian mystic and self-proclaimed holy man who befriended the family of Emperor Nicholas II, the last monarch of Russia, and gained considerable influence in late imperial Russia.\n Rasputin was born to a peasant family in the Siberian village  of Pokrovskoye in the  Tyumensky Uyezd of Tobolsk Governorate (now Yarkovsky District of Tyumen Oblast). He had a religious conversion experience after taking a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897. He has been described as a monk or as a \"strannik\" (wanderer or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. He traveled to St. Petersburg in 1903 or the winter of 1904\u201305, where he captivated some church and social leaders. He became a society figure and met the Tsar in November 1905.\n In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a healer for the only son of Tsar Nicholas II, Alexei, who suffered from hemophilia. He was a divisive figure at court, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The high point of Rasputin's power was in 1915 when Nicholas II left St. Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting World War I, increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin's influence. Russian defeats mounted during the war, however, and both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative noblemen who opposed his influence over Alexandra and the Tsar.\n Historians often suggest that Rasputin's terrible reputation helped discredit the tsarist government, and thus helped precipitate the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty which happened a few weeks after he was assassinated. Accounts of his life and influence were often based on hearsay and rumor.",

  "/wiki/Pope_Leo_X": "Pope Leo X (11 December 1475 \u2013 1 December 1521), born Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, was pope and ruler of the Papal States from 9 March 1513 to his death in 1521.\n Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence, Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489. Following the death of Pope Julius II, Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College. Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, but struggled to implement the reforms agreed. In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino, but which reduced papal finances.\n In Protestant circles, Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter's Basilica, a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther's 95 Theses. He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation, and his Papal Bull of 1520, Exsurge Domine, condemned Martin Luther's condemnatory stance, rendering ongoing communication difficult.\n He borrowed and spent money without circumspection and was a significant patron of the arts. Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Leo also reorganised the Roman University, and promoted the study of literature, poetry and antiquities. He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. He was the last pope not to have been in priestly orders at the time of his election to the papacy.",

The plot centres on the pilgrim's failed attempts to gain entry to the castle by any means possible, and the lengths the lord will go to in order to stop him.  In one memorable scene once the assailant has gained entry the lord brandishes an aerosol can labelled \"Knight-Rid\" to stop the pilgrim in his tracks\n Further filming at Hever was planned May 1984 as filmmaker Charles Wallace intended to expand the film using Beryl Reid to play Eric\u2019s mother, and another damsel in the cast.

The film was released with the James Bond movie Octopussy and WarGames (see production company website movingimageco.com).  It was later shown on numerous cable TV channels and was released in 1994 on VHS at a time of resurgence in interest in the work of Morecambe and Wise, the BBC having screened a three (late expanded to five) part tribute to mark the tenth anniversary of his death.
