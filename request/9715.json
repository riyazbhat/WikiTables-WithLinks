He made primarily shomin-geki (working-class drama) films with female protagonists, portrayed by actresses such as Hideko Takamine, Kinuyo Tanaka, and Setsuko Hara. Because of his focus on family drama and the intersection of traditional and modern Japanese culture, his films are frequently compared with the works of Yasujir\u014d Ozu. His reputation is just behind Akira Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Ozu in Japan and internationally; his work remains less well known outside Japan than theirs.\n Among Naruse's most revered films are Late Chrysanthemums (1954), Floating Clouds (1955), and When a Woman Ascends the Stairs (1960). Akira Kurosawa referred to Naruse's style of melodrama as like a great river with a calm surface and a raging current in its depths.",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television, drama is a genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone. Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre, such as police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical period drama, domestic drama, teen drama or comedy-drama. These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods.\n All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent (mimesis) characters. In this broader sense, drama is a mode distinct from novels, short stories, and narrative poetry or songs. In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television, drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy. It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted. Radio drama has been used in both senses\u2014originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.",

  "/wiki/The_Loyal_47_Ronin": "The revenge of the forty-seven r\u014dnin (\u56db\u5341\u4e03\u58eb, Yon-j\u016b-Nana-shi, forty-seven samurai), also known as the Ak\u014d incident (\u8d64\u7a42\u4e8b\u4ef6, Ak\u014d jiken) or Ak\u014d vendetta, is an 18th-century historical event in Japan in which a band of r\u014dnin (leaderless samurai) avenged the death of their master. The incident has since become legendary. The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless after their daimy\u014d (feudal lord) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform seppuku (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka, whose title was K\u014dzuke no suke. After waiting and planning for a year, the r\u014dnin avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. They were then themselves obliged to commit seppuku for the crime of murder. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity. Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the forty-seven r\u014dnin are known as Ch\u016bshingura.",
