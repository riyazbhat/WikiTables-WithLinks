  "/wiki/A_Hard_Day's_Night_(song)": "\"A Hard Day's Night\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney, it was written by John Lennon, with some collaboration from Paul McCartney. It was released on the film soundtrack of the same name in 1964. It was also released in the UK as a single, with \"Things We Said Today\" as its B-side.\n The song featured prominently on the soundtrack to the Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night, and was on their album of the same name. The song topped the charts in both the United Kingdom and United States when it was released as a single. The American and British singles of \"A Hard Day's Night\" as well as both the American and British albums of the same title all held the top position in their respective charts for a couple of weeks in August 1964, the first time any artist had accomplished this feat.",
  "/wiki/A_Hard_Day's_Night_(album)": "A Hard Day's Night is the third studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 10 July 1964, with side one containing songs from the soundtrack to their film of the same name. The American version of the album was released two weeks earlier, on 26 June 1964 by United Artists Records, with a different track listing. In contrast to the Beatles' first two albums, all 13 tracks on A Hard Day's Night were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, showcasing the development of their songwriting partnership. The album includes the song \"A Hard Day's Night\", with its distinctive opening chord, and \"Can't Buy Me Love\", both transatlantic number-one singles for the band. Several of the songs feature George Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar, a sound that was influential on the Byrds and on other groups in the folk rock movement. The title of the album was the accidental creation of drummer Ringo Starr. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: \"I was going home in the car and [film director] Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo.",

It is on the National Register of Historic Places, and the interior has been designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.",
  "/wiki/And_Your_Bird_Can_Sing": "\"And Your Bird Can Sing\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on their 1966 album Revolver, apart from in the United States and Canada, where it instead appeared on Yesterday and Today. The song was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Paul McCartney stated that he helped on the lyrics and attributed the song \"80\u201320\" to Lennon. The working title was \"You Don't Get Me\". The song is notable for its extended dual-guitar melody, played by George Harrison and Paul McCartney. Lennon was later dismissive of the track, as he was of many of his compositions at the time, referring to it as \"another of my throwaways ... fancy paper around an empty box\".",
  "/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content. The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. The songs reflect the group's interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its innovative tracks are the psychedelic \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", recorded using tape loops controlled on several machines simultaneously; \"Eleanor Rigby\", a meditation on loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and \"Love You To\", a foray into Hindustani classical music.",
  "/wiki/Nippon_Budokan": "Nippon Budokan (\u65e5\u672c\u6b66\u9053\u9928, Nippon Bud\u014dkan), often shortened to simply Budokan, is an indoor arena located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. Budokan was originally built for the judo competition in the 1964 Summer Olympics, hence its name, which translates in English as Martial Ways Hall. Its primary purpose is to host martial arts contests and for a time was a popular venue for Japanese professional wrestling. It has hosted numerous other sporting events such as the 1967 Women's Volleyball World Championship and other events such as musical concerts. A number of famous rock music acts have played at Budokan, such as Tina Turner in 1985. The Beatles were the first rock group to play there, in a series of concerts held between June 30 and July 2, 1966. Another big act to enter the stage at Budokan were ABBA. They ended their last tour there, ABBA: The Tour.",
  "/wiki/Back_in_the_U.S.S.R.": "\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that opens their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as the \"White Album\"). It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. The song is a rock and roll parody of Chuck Berry's \"Back in the U.S.A.\" and the Beach Boys' \"California Girls\". Its lyrics transpose Berry's patriotic sentiments about the United States to Communist Russia, as the narrator expresses his relief at returning home to the Soviet Union, or more formally the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The Beatles recorded \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" as a three-piece after Ringo Starr temporarily left the group, out of protest at McCartney's criticism of his drumming and the tensions that typified the sessions for the White Album. Instead, the other Beatles created a composite drum track from numerous takes. McCartney's singing was based on Jerry Lee Lewis, while the bridge features a Beach Boys-style celebration of girls from various locations in the USSR. The track opens and closes with a tape loop of an aircraft landing on a runway.",
  "/wiki/The_Beatles_(album)": "The Beatles, also known as the White Album, is the ninth studio album and only double album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 1968. Its plain white sleeve has no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed,[a] which was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, British blues, ska, music hall and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as among the greatest albums of all time. Most of the songs on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation, relative to all their releases since 1966's Revolver.",
  "/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios": "Abbey Road Studios (formerly EMI Recording Studios) is a recording studio at 3 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, City of Westminster, London, England. It was established in November 1931 by the Gramophone Company, a predecessor of British music company EMI, which owned it until Universal Music took control of part of EMI in 2013.\n Abbey Road's most notable client was the Beatles, who used the studio \u2014 particularly its Studio Two room \u2014 as the venue for many of the innovative recording techniques that they adopted throughout the 1960s. In 1970, the studio was renamed from EMI in honour of the group's 1969 album Abbey Road.\n In 2009, Abbey Road came under threat of sale to property developers. In response, the British Government protected the site, granting it English Heritage Grade II listed status in 2010, thereby preserving the building from any major alterations.",
  "/wiki/Birthday_(Beatles_song)": "\"Birthday\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\"). Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, it is the opening track on the third side of the LP (or the second disc in CD versions of the record).

It was recorded more than two years later by the Beatles and included on their first album released in the United Kingdom, Please Please Me (1963).",
  "/wiki/Please_Please_Me": "Please Please Me is the debut studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Produced by George Martin, it was released on EMI's Parlophone label on 22 March 1963 in the United Kingdom, following the success of the band's singles \"Please Please Me\" and \"Love Me Do\", which reached number 1 on the NME and Melody Maker charts and number 17 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively. The album topped Record Retailer's LP chart for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement for a pop album at that time.\n Besides their already released singles, the Beatles recorded the majority of Please Please Me in one long recording session at EMI Studios on 11 February 1963; overdubs were later added by Martin to \"Misery\" and \"Baby It's You\" on 20 February. Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by Lennon\u2013McCartney (originally credited \"McCartney\u2013Lennon\"). Rolling Stone magazine later cited these original compositions as early evidence of the Beatles' \"[invention of] the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments\". In 2012, Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It was voted number 622 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).",

The club became closely associated with the Merseybeat music genre and, famously, regularly played host to The Beatles in their early years.\n The Cavern Club closed and opened in a new site on March 1973 and was filled in during construction work on the Merseyrail underground rail loop. It would later be excavated and reopened on 26 April 1984.",

The song was then released on the group's third UK album A Hard Day's Night. In September 2015, the Beatles donated the use of their recording of the song to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for a television commercial.",
  "/wiki/Come_Together": "\"Come Together\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney.

  "/wiki/Abbey_Road": "Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. Named after the location of EMI Studios in London, the cover features the group walking across the street's zebra crossing, an image that became one of the most famous and imitated in popular music. The album's initially mixed reviews were contrasted by its immediate commercial success, topping record charts in the UK and US. Lead single \"Something\" / \"Come Together\" was released in October and topped US charts. The album incorporates genres such as blues, rock and pop, and makes prominent use of Moog synthesizer, sounds filtered through a Leslie speaker, and tom-tom drums. It is their only album recorded exclusively through a solid-state transistor mixing desk, which afforded a clearer and brighter sound compared to the group's previous records. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece. The sessions also produced a non-album single, \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" backed with \"Old Brown Shoe\".",
  "/wiki/Day_Tripper": "\"Day Tripper\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double A-side single with \"We Can Work It Out\" in December 1965. Written primarily by John Lennon, it was credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. Both songs were recorded during the sessions for the band's Rubber Soul album. The single topped charts in Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. In the United States, \"Day Tripper\" peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and \"We Can Work It Out\" held the top position. \"Day Tripper\" is a rock song based around an electric guitar riff and was included in the Beatles' concert set-list for about a year until their retirement from live performances in late August 1966. The single was the first example of a double A-side in Britain. Its success popularised the format and, in giving equal treatment to two songs, allowed recording artists to show their versatility.",
  "/wiki/Dear_Prudence": "\"Dear Prudence\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\"). The song was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. Written in Rishikesh during the group's trip to India in early 1968, it was inspired by actress Mia Farrow's sister, Prudence Farrow, who became obsessive about meditating while practising with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Her designated partners on the meditation course, Lennon and George Harrison, attempted to coax Farrow out of her seclusion, which led to Lennon writing the song. Lennon wrote \"Dear Prudence\" using a finger-picking guitar technique that he learned from singer-songwriter Donovan. Its lyrics are simple and innocent and celebrate the beauty of nature. The Beatles recorded the song at Trident Studios in late August 1968 as a three-piece after Ringo Starr temporarily left the group out of protest at McCartney's criticism of his drumming on \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" and the tensions that typified the sessions for the White Album. The final recording also features contributions from Mal Evans, Jackie Lomax and John McCartney.",
  "/wiki/Dig_a_Pony": "\"Dig a Pony\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, originally released on their 1970 album Let It Be. It was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney.

  "/wiki/Let_It_Be_(Beatles_album)": "Let It Be is the twelfth and final studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, almost a month after the group's break-up, in tandem with the motion picture of the same name. Like most of the band's previous releases, the album topped record charts in many countries, including both the US and the UK. However, the critical response was generally unfavourable, and Let It Be came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums ever. Rehearsals began at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969 as part of a planned documentary showing the Beatles' return to live performance. Paul McCartney conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the band by returning to simpler rock and roll configurations. The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling, leading to George Harrison's temporary departure from the group. As a condition of his return, the members reconvened at their own Apple Studio with guest keyboardist Billy Preston.",

Joined by keyboardist Billy Preston, the band played a 42-minute set before the Metropolitan Police asked them to reduce the volume.\n Although the concert was conceived just days before, the Beatles were planning a return to live performances throughout the early sessions for their album Let It Be (1970). They performed nine takes of five songs as crowds of onlookers, many of whom were on their lunch break, congregated in the streets and on the roofs of local buildings.  The concert ended with the conclusion of \"Get Back\", with John Lennon joking, \"I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we've passed the audition.\"\n Footage from the performance was used in the 1970 documentary film Let It Be. The first performance of \"I've Got a Feeling\" and single takes of \"One After 909\" and \"Dig a Pony\" were also featured on the accompanying album.",
  "/wiki/Do_You_Want_to_Know_a_Secret": "\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" is a song by English rock group the Beatles from their 1963 album Please Please Me, sung by George Harrison.

It was first released on the British version of the band's 1965 album Rubber Soul; it also appeared in North America on the Yesterday and Today collection. The upbeat, lighthearted \"Drive My Car\" was used as the opening track for both albums. Over the years the song has been covered by many artists such as former Spice Girls member Melanie C and Lulu, and the US band Breakfast Club, the latter which was featured in the 1988 film License to Drive, that was played over the opening credits.",
  "/wiki/Rubber_Soul": "Rubber Soul is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 3 December 1965 in the United Kingdom, on EMI's Parlophone label, accompanied by the non-album double A-side single \"Day Tripper\" / \"We Can Work It Out\". The original North American version of the album, issued by Capitol Records, contained ten of the fourteen songs and two tracks withheld from the band's Help! album. Rubber Soul met with a highly favourable critical response and topped sales charts in Britain and the United States for several weeks. The recording sessions took place in London over a four-week period beginning in October 1965. For the first time in their career, the band were able to record an album free of concert, radio or film commitments. Often referred to as a folk rock album, particularly in its Capitol configuration, Rubber Soul incorporates a mix of pop, soul and folk musical styles.",

The song was released in the United Kingdom in December 1964 on the album Beatles for Sale. In the United States, it was first issued as a single in February 1965 before appearing on the North American release Beatles VI.

The Beatles recorded \"Eight Days a Week\" at EMI Studios in London in October 1964. The track opens with a fade-in, marking the first time that this technique had been used on a pop studio recording.",
  "/wiki/Beatles_for_Sale": "Beatles for Sale is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI's Parlophone label. The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterised the Beatles' previous work, partly due to the band's exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. Beatles for Sale was not released in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was standardised for release on CD. Instead, eight of the album's fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records' concurrent release, Beatles '65, issued in North America only. The Beatles recorded the album at EMI Studios in London in between their touring and radio engagements. The songs introduced darker musical moods and more introspective lyrics, with John Lennon adopting an autobiographical perspective in compositions such as \"I'm a Loser\" and \"No Reply\". The album also reflected the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan, whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964.",

Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom[nb 1] and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour. In August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept.",
  "/wiki/Good_Morning_Good_Morning": "\"Good Morning Good Morning\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Inspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes. Another reference to contemporary television was the lyric \"It's time for tea and Meet the Wife\", referring to the BBC sitcom.",
  "/wiki/Hello,_Goodbye": "\"Hello, Goodbye\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Backed by John Lennon's \"I Am the Walrus\", it was issued as a non-album single in November 1967, the group's first release since the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. The single was commercially successful around the world, topping charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and several other countries. McCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song originated when, in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for \"I Am the Walrus\" to be the single's A-side, before reluctantly accepting that \"Hello, Goodbye\" was the more commercial-sounding of the two sides. The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America.",
  "/wiki/Magical_Mystery_Tour": "Magical Mystery Tour is a record by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double EP in the United Kingdom and an LP in the United States. It includes the soundtrack to the 1967 film of the same name. The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the Parlophone label, while the Capitol Records LP release in the US occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year. It was not released as an eleven-track LP in the UK until 1976. In their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since Revolver (1966). Paul McCartney led the project and contributed three songs, while John Lennon and George Harrison contributed \"I Am the Walrus\" and \"Blue Jay Way\", respectively. The sessions were often characterised as aimless and undisciplined, including by producer George Martin, whose input on the band's recordings began to wane.",
  "/wiki/Helter_Skelter_(song)": "\"Helter Skelter\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\"). It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The song was a product of McCartney's attempt to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible. The Beatles' recording has been noted for its \"proto-metal roar\" and is considered by music historians to be a key influence in the early development of heavy metal. In 1976, the song was released as the B-side of \"Got to Get You into My Life\" in the United States, to promote the Capitol Records compilation Rock 'n' Roll Music. Along with other tracks from the White Album, \"Helter Skelter\" was interpreted by cult leader Charles Manson as a message predicting inter-racial war in the US. Manson titled his vision of this uprising \"Helter Skelter\" after the song. Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Helter Skelter\" 52nd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs\".",
  "/wiki/Here_Comes_the_Sun": "\"Here Comes the Sun\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1969 album Abbey Road. It was written by George Harrison and is one of his best-known compositions for the Beatles. Harrison wrote the song in early 1969 at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton, where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation. The lyrics reflect his relief at the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band's business affairs. As of September 2019, it was the most streamed Beatles song in the United Kingdom, with over 50 million plays. The Beatles recorded \"Here Comes the Sun\" at London's EMI Studios in the summer of 1969. Led by Harrison's acoustic guitar, the track features Moog synthesizer, which he had introduced to the band's sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California. Reflecting the continued influence of Indian classical music on Harrison's writing, the composition includes several time signature changes.",
  "/wiki/List_of_songs_in_The_Beatles:_Rock_Band": "The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts, in association with Apple Corps. It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series and is available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii consoles. The game allows one to six players to simulate the performance of songs by the Beatles by providing the players with peripherals modelled after musical instruments (a guitar peripheral for lead guitar and bass gameplay, a drum peripheral, and a microphone). The gameplay mechanics of the game are similar to those found in other Rock Band games, in which players use the instrument controllers to match scrolling on-screen notes in time to the music to score points.\n The 45-song selection of the Beatles' music on the game's disc was praised by critics, considering the list to be emotional, sentimental and a good cross-section of the band's catalogue. Compared to other music video games released previously, the number of tracks in The Beatles: Rock Band was considered small, and the inclusion of certain lesser-known songs, and the exclusion of more popular ones, was considered confusing. In addition to the on-disc songs, The Beatles: Rock Band features downloadable content, in the form of both singles and full albums (excluding those songs already on disc), allowing players to play through the album in a single session, once the album has been obtained."
