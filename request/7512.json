The country fielded thirty-two athletes in cross-country skiing, biathlon, and alpine skiing. Russia placed first overall in the total medal count, winning thirty-eight medals overall.\n Russia's success at the Vancouver Paralympics stood in sharp contrast with its disappointing performance at the Vancouver Olympics the previous month, attracting media attention. The Moscow Times noted the irony in the fact that there had been high hope for Russia's Winter Olympians, while fairly little attention had been paid to its Paralympians, until their performance stood out with a crop of medals. While the Moscow Times focused on the difficulties faced by the country's Paralympians in their everyday life, however, the Vancouver Sun remarked: \"Unlike Canada and other countries where almost all Paralympians must have jobs, Team Russia's competitors are akin to 'sports professionals'. Most don't work so they can focus solely on their training, which is funded by the state and individual sponsors\".\nWith Sochi being the host city of the 2014 Winter Paralympics, a Russian segment was performed at the closing ceremony."
