Following the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917-1922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds; however, after World War II (1939-1945), attendance at the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting Communist ideals. The Olympic Committee of the USSR was formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951).
