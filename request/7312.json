  "/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse": "The Uffington White Horse is a prehistoric hill figure, 110\u00a0m (360\u00a0ft) long, formed from deep trenches filled with crushed white chalk. The figure is situated on the upper slopes of White Horse Hill in the English civil parish of Uffington (in the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire and historic county of Berkshire), some 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) east of Swindon, 8\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) south of the town of Faringdon and a similar distance west of the town of Wantage; or 2.5\u00a0km (1.6\u00a0mi) south of Uffington. The hill forms a part of the scarp of the Berkshire Downs and overlooks the Vale of White Horse to the north. The best views of the figure are obtained from the air, or from directly across the Vale, particularly around the villages of Great Coxwell, Longcot and Fernham. The site is owned and managed by the National Trust and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The Guardian stated in 2003 that \"for more than 3,000 years, the Uffington White Horse has been jealously guarded as a masterpiece of minimalist art.\" The Uffington Horse is by far the oldest of the white horse figures in Britain and is of an entirely different design from the others inspired by it.",

Located on the edge of Bratton Downs and lying just below an Iron Age hill fort, it is the oldest of several white horses carved in Wiltshire. It was restored in 1778, an action which may have obliterated another horse that had occupied the same slope. A contemporary engraving from the 1760s appears to show a horse facing in the opposite direction that was rather smaller than the present figure. There is, however, no documentation or other evidence for the existence of a chalk horse at Westbury before 1742.",
