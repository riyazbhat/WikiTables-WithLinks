Between 2006 and 2011 the island was run by Tribewanted, a self-described unique community tourism project. During this time, the island and the project received extensive media coverage, including a five-part BBC documentary called Paradise or Bust. In 2012, the Mali community began a partnership with Bridge the Gap, a non-governmental organization that assists communities with sustainable community development. Bridge the Gap partners with Vorovoro in the planning and execution of Vorovoros community development goals and to bolster Vororovos global outreach opportunities while maintaining the integrity of the tribes rich cultural heritage and working to protect the local natural environment. The partnership uses a multipronged approach for reaching these development goals. This approach includes business mentorship programs, sustainable agricultural training, infrastructure support, and networking with various international organizations. However, the most unique approach may be the formation of a Fijian-run eco-tourism business; facing pressures to develop Vorovoro island into a profitable tourism enterprise owned and managed by foreign investors, Vorovoro leadership had wanted a way to retain control of their traditional community home. By opening their home to a limited number of (predominately student) visitors each year, Vorovoro has been able to take control of tourism on their land while creating a source of income for the Mali community. In collaboration with Bridge the Gap, Vorovoro has formed a partnership with the Auburn University College of Human Sciences to develop and offer a unique, accredited study abroad program focused on cultural immersion, environmental awareness, and global sustainability.",
