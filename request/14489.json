  "/wiki/Elvis_Presley": "Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935\u00a0\u2013 August 16, 1977), also known simply as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"The King\".\n Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial.\n In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.\n Presley is the best-selling solo music artist of all time. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds the records for the most RIAA certified Gold and Platinum albums. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",

While most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band in high school.

The tune peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the number 8 single of 1961 according to Billboard. The track reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.\n The tune was composed as \"Tell the World\" by Stephens and Torres of the String-A-Longs, who were then called the Leen Teens.  When this was recorded at Norman Petty's studio, the song was backed by Petty's composition entitled \"Wheels\".  But when the single was issued by Warwick Records the labels for the two sides were switched and so \"Tell the World\" became \"Wheels\".  When it became a hit, Petty claimed the composing credit, as shown by the label.  In 1964, the parties agreed to share the credit and so the Broadcast Music copyright agency recorded all three as the composers.\n Another version of the origin of 'Wheels' is that Norman Petty had written the hit instrumental while the String-A-Longs had composed a boogie instrumental they had titled as 'Wheels'. Petty's instrumental was initially called 'Tell the World'. When the record was pressed, the labels were reversed. This listed Torres and Stephens as the writers of Petty's instrumental. Petty was credited as the writer on the flip-side in error also. It seems that Petty was able to claim a credit for writing Wheels, but the confusion has never really ended. However, since Stephens and Torres were never eliminated completely as 'co-writers' of the song, it seems possible that they did compose some part of the song, while recording it. Keith McCormack one of the band members stated that he got too hoarse to sing another song they'd brought from Plainview to Clovis to record on that day, so they instead recorded Petty's instrumental which became the hit.\n In Britain later the same year the tune was revived by the Joe Loss Orchestra as \"Wheels Cha Cha\"; it reached #21.
