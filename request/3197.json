  "/wiki/Metre_per_second": "The metre per second  is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second.\n The SI unit symbols are m/s, m\u00b7s\u22121, m s\u22121, or m/s, sometimes (unofficially) abbreviated as mps.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/Speed": "In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position); it is thus a scalar quantity. The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero.\n Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second, but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour. For air and marine travel the knot is commonly used.\n The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second (approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.",
  "/wiki/Velocity": "The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60 km/h to the north). Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.\n Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI (metric system) as metres per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m\u22c5s\u22121). For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar, whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration.",
  "/wiki/Metre_per_second_squared": "The metre per second squared is the unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI). As a derived unit, it is composed from the SI base units of length, the metre, and time, the second. Its symbol is written in several forms as m/s2, m\u00b7s\u22122 or m s\u22122, or less commonly, as m/s/s.\n As acceleration, the unit is interpreted physically as change in velocity or speed per time interval, i.e. metre per second per second and is treated as a vector quantity.",
  "/wiki/Acceleration": "In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.\nAccelerations are vector quantities (they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object.  The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's Second Law., is the combined effect of two causes:",
  "/wiki/Jerk_(physics)": "In physics, jerk (also known as jolt) is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time. Jerk is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction), and can be expressed in m/s3 (in SI units) or in standard gravities per second (g/s). Jerk is the time derivative of acceleration, the second derivative of velocity, and the third derivative of position. Jounce, also known as snap, is the fourth derivative of position and the first derivative of jerk.",
  "/wiki/Jounce": "In physics, jounce, also known as snap, is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, or the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time. Equivalently, it is the second derivative of acceleration or the third derivative of velocity.\nJounce is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions:",
  "/wiki/Radian_per_second": "The radian per second (symbol: rad\u00b7s\u22121 or rad/s) is the SI unit of rotational speed (angular velocity), commonly denoted by the Greek letter \u03c9 (omega). The radian per second is also the unit of angular frequency.\nThe radian per second is defined as the change in the orientation of an object, in radians, every second.",
  "/wiki/Angular_velocity": "In physics, angular velocity refers to how fast an object rotates or revolves relative to another point, i.e. how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point object revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. Spin angular velocity is independent of the choice of origin, in contrast to orbital angular velocity  which depends on the choice of origin. In general, angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time, e.g.",
  "/wiki/Radian_per_second_squared": "Angular acceleration is the time rate of change of angular velocity. In three dimensions, it is a pseudovector. In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s2), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (\u03b1). Just like angular velocity, there are two types of angular acceleration: spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration, representing the time rate of change of spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity respectively. Unlike linear acceleration, angular acceleration need not be caused by a net external torque. For example, a figure skater can speed up her rotation (thereby obtaining an angular acceleration) simply by contracting her arms inwards, which involves no external torque.",

  "/wiki/Frequency_drift": "In electrical engineering, and particularly in telecommunications, frequency drift is an unintended and generally arbitrary offset of an oscillator from its nominal frequency. Causes may include component aging, changes in temperature that alter the piezoelectric effect in a crystal oscillator, or problems with a voltage regulator which controls the bias voltage to the oscillator. Frequency drift is traditionally measured in Hz/s. Frequency stability can be regarded as the absence (or a very low level) of frequency drift. On a radio transmitter, frequency drift can cause a radio station to drift into an adjacent channel, causing illegal interference. Because of this, Frequency allocation regulations specify the allowed tolerance for such oscillators in a type-accepted device. A temperature-compensated, voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (TCVCXO) is normally used for frequency modulation. On the receiver side, frequency drift was mainly a problem in early tuners, particularly for analog dial tuning, and especially on FM, which exhibits a capture effect.",
  "/wiki/Cubic_metre_per_second": "A cubic metre per second (m3s\u22121, m3/s, cumecs or cubic meter per second in American English) is a derived SI unit of volumetric flow rate equal to that of a stere or cube with sides of one metre (~39.37 in) in length exchanged or moving each second. It is popularly used for water flow, especially in rivers and streams, and fractions for HVAC values measuring air flow.\n The term cumec is also used, as shorthand for \"Cubic metres per second\", with the plural form cumecs also common in speech.[citation needed] It is commonly used between workers in the measurement of water flow through natural streams and civil works, but rarely used in writing.  Data in units of cumec are used along the y-axis or vertical axis of a flow hydrograph, which describes the time variation of discharge of a river (the mean velocity multiplied by cross-sectional area).  A moderately sized river discharges in the order of 100 cumecs.",
  "/wiki/Volumetric_flow": "In physics and engineering, in particular fluid dynamics and hydrometry, the volumetric flow rate (also known as volume flow rate, rate of fluid flow or volume velocity) is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time; usually represented by the symbol Q (sometimes V\u0307). The SI unit is cubic metres per second (m3/s). Another unit used is standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm).\n In US customary units and imperial units, volumetric flow rate is often expressed as cubic feet per second (ft3/s) or gallons per minute (either US or imperial definitions).\n Volumetric flow rate should not be confused with volumetric flux, as defined by Darcy's law and represented by the symbol q, with units of m3/(m2\u00b7s), that is, m\u00b7s\u22121. The integration of a flux over an area gives the volumetric flow rate.",
  "/wiki/SI_derived_unit": "SI derived units are units of measurement derived from the seven base units specified by the International System of Units (SI). They are either dimensionless or can be expressed as a product of one or more of the base units, possibly scaled by an appropriate power of exponentiation. \n The SI has special names for 22 of these derived units (for example, hertz, the SI unit of measurement of frequency), but the rest merely reflect their derivation: for example, the square metre (m2), the SI derived unit of area; and the kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3 or kg\u22c5m\u22123), the SI derived unit of density. \n The names of SI derived units, when written in full, are always in lowercase. However, the symbols for units named after persons are written with an uppercase initial letter. For example, the symbol for hertz is \"Hz\", but the symbol for metre is \"m\"."
