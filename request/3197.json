  "/wiki/Metre_per_second": "The metre per second  is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second.",
  "/wiki/Speed": "In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position); it is thus a scalar quantity. The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero.",
  "/wiki/Velocity": "The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60\u00a0km/h to the north). Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.",
  "/wiki/Metre_per_second_squared": "The metre per second squared is the unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI). As a derived unit, it is composed from the SI base units of length, the metre, and time, the second. Its symbol is written in several forms as m/s2, m\u00b7s\u22122 or m\u00a0s\u22122, or less commonly, as m/s/s.",
  "/wiki/Acceleration": "In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.\nAccelerations are vector quantities (they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object.  The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's Second Law., is the combined effect of two causes:",
  "/wiki/Jerk_(physics)": "In physics, jerk (also known as jolt) is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time. Jerk is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction), and can be expressed in m/s3 (in SI units) or in standard gravities per second (g/s). Jerk is the time derivative of acceleration, the second derivative of velocity, and the third derivative of position. Jounce, also known as snap, is the fourth derivative of position and the first derivative of jerk.",
  "/wiki/Jounce": "In physics, jounce, also known as snap, is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, or the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time. Equivalently, it is the second derivative of acceleration or the third derivative of velocity.\nJounce is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions:",
  "/wiki/Radian_per_second": "The radian per second (symbol: rad\u00b7s\u22121 or rad/s) is the SI unit of rotational speed (angular velocity), commonly denoted by the Greek letter \u03c9 (omega). The radian per second is also the unit of angular frequency.\nThe radian per second is defined as the change in the orientation of an object, in radians, every second.",
  "/wiki/Angular_velocity": "In physics, angular velocity refers to how fast an object rotates or revolves relative to another point, i.e. how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point object revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin.  Spin angular velocity is independent of the choice of origin, in contrast to orbital angular velocity  which depends on the choice of origin.",
  "/wiki/Radian_per_second_squared": "Angular acceleration is the time rate of change of angular velocity. In three dimensions, it is a pseudovector. In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s2), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (\u03b1). Just like angular velocity, there are two types of angular acceleration: spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration, representing the time rate of change of spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity respectively. Unlike linear acceleration, angular acceleration need not be caused by a net external torque. For example, a figure skater can speed up her rotation (thereby obtaining an angular acceleration) simply by contracting her arms inwards, which involves no external torque.",

  "/wiki/Frequency_drift": "In electrical engineering, and particularly in telecommunications, frequency drift is an unintended and generally arbitrary offset of an oscillator from its nominal frequency.  Causes may include component aging, changes in temperature that alter the piezoelectric effect in a crystal oscillator, or problems with a voltage regulator which controls the bias voltage to the oscillator. Frequency drift is traditionally measured in Hz/s. Frequency stability can be regarded as the absence (or a very low level) of frequency drift.",
  "/wiki/Cubic_metre_per_second": "A cubic metre per second (m3s\u22121, m3/s, cumecs or cubic meter per second in American English) is a derived SI unit of volumetric flow rate equal to that of a stere or cube with sides of one metre (~39.37 in) in length exchanged or moving each second. It is popularly used for water flow, especially in rivers and streams, and fractions for HVAC values measuring air flow.",
  "/wiki/Volumetric_flow": "In physics and engineering, in particular fluid dynamics and hydrometry, the volumetric flow rate (also known as volume flow rate, rate of fluid flow or volume velocity) is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time; usually represented by the symbol Q (sometimes V\u0307). The SI unit is cubic metres per second (m3/s). Another unit used is standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm).",
  "/wiki/SI_derived_unit": "SI derived units are units of measurement derived from the seven base units specified by the International System of Units (SI). They are either dimensionless or can be expressed as a product of one or more of the base units, possibly scaled by an appropriate power of exponentiation."
