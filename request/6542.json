A mid-tempo pop punk song, it was written by Hoppus based on personal experience. It was originally titled \"Peter Pan Complex\", an allusion to the pop-psychology concept, but MCA Records forced the band to retitle the song, as the label found it too obscure of a reference. It was the first Blink-182 single to feature drummer Travis Barker. It became Blink-182\u2019s second hit single, peaking at number two on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart for ten weeks.",
  "/wiki/Blink-182": "Blink-182 (often stylized in all lowercase as blink-182), is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bass guitarist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Bassist Mark Hoppus is the only constant band member. In its early years, Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band's debut, Cheshire Cat (1995). The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album, Dude Ranch (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker.

  "/wiki/Adam's_Song": "\"Adam's Song\" is a song recorded by the American rock band Blink-182 for its third studio album, Enema of the State (1999). It was released as the third and final single from Enema of the State on September 5, 2000 through MCA Records. \"Adam's Song\" shares writing credits between the band's guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus, but Hoppus was the primary composer of the song. The track concerns suicide, depression and loneliness. It incorporates a piano in its bridge section and was regarded as one of the most serious songs the band had written to that point. Hoppus was inspired by the loneliness he experienced while on tour; while his bandmates had significant others to return home to, he was single. He was also influenced by a teen suicide letter he read in a magazine. The song takes the form of a suicide note, and contains lyrical allusions to the Nirvana song \"Come as You Are\".",

Many critics described his music as operatic, nicknaming him \"the Caruso of Rock\" and \"the Big O\". While most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses. Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band in high school. He was signed by Sam Phillips, of Sun Records, in 1956, but his greatest success came with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the Billboard Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"Only the Lonely\" (1960), \"Running Scared\" (1961), \"Crying\" (1961), \"In Dreams\" (1963), and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964).

It also reached number three on the UK Singles Chart in early 1989, posthumously released after Orbison's heart attack on December 6, 1988. Although it is an Orbison solo single, Orbison's fellow Traveling Wilburys bandmates, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, co-wrote the song and played instruments on the record. According to Riesco, the song was recorded at guitarist Mike Campbell's garage in Los Angeles, California and mixed at Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, England.
