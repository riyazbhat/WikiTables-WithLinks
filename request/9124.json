  "/wiki/\u00d6sters_IF": "\u00d6sters Idrottsf\u00f6rening, commonly known as \u00d6sters IF or simply \u00d6ster, is a Swedish sports club located in V\u00e4xj\u00f6, specializing in football, and playing in the second tier of Swedish football, Superettan. The club has previously also competed in ice hockey (see separate article), bandy, and bowling. \u00d6ster was formed on 20 April 1930 as \u00d6sters Fotbollf\u00f6rening, before adopting the name \u00d6sters IF in 1932. The club is affiliated to the Sm\u00e5lands Fotbollf\u00f6rbund. In 1968, their first season in Allsvenskan, \u00d6ster became the first team ever to win the national title at their first attempt (newly-promoted IF Elfsborg won the league in 1961 but had played in, and been winners of, the championship in the past). This win ignited the team's 'golden age' which lasted until the early 1980s and saw them win a total of four Swedish championships. On 31 March 2011, \u00d6ster broke ground on their new arena, Myresj\u00f6hus Arena, which was inaugurated in August 2012. The arena hosted four games of the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 tournament.",
