The new bridge was originally called Bradley's Bridge because it was close by John Bradley's mill. The covered bridge was built in the Howe style, a type of construction, which introduced iron rods into the bridge trusses. That popular design served as a transition from wooden bridges to those built of iron and steel. The bridge was 30 feet high and spanned 163 feet over Long Cane Creek. It rested on two stone abutments with four supporting piers in the creek bed. The bridge consisted of thirteen boxed X-panel trusses with stabilizing iron turnbuckles.

  "/wiki/Lattice_truss_bridge": "A lattice bridge is a form of truss bridge that uses many small, closely spaced diagonal elements forming a lattice. The lattice Truss Bridge was patented in 1820 by architect Ithiel Town. Originally a design to allow a substantial bridge to be made from planks employing lower-skilled labor, rather than heavy timbers and more expensive carpenters, this type of bridge has also been constructed using many relatively light iron or steel members. The individual elements are more easily handled by the construction workers, but the bridge also requires substantial support during construction. A simple lattice truss will transform the applied loads into a thrust, as the bridge will tend to change length under load. This is resisted by pinning the lattice members to the top and bottom chords, which are more substantial than the lattice members, but which may also be fabricated from relatively small elements rather than large beams."
