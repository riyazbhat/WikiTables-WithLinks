Produced by Thames Television for the ITV Network, the series first ran from 30 April 1973 to 19 February 1979.

She has often played characters who fell into the trope of a dumb blonde with a high-pitched voice in the UK, notably in the Birds Eye Beefburger TV advertisements, directed by Alan Parker, in the early 1970s.

  "/wiki/LWT": "London Weekend Television (LWT) was the ITV network franchise holder for Greater London and the Home Counties at weekends, broadcasting from Fridays at 5.15 pm (7:00 pm from 1968 until 1982) to Monday mornings at 6:00. From 1968 until 1992, when LWT's weekday counterpart was Thames Television, there was an on-screen handover to LWT on Friday nights (there was no handover back to Thames on Mondays, as from 1968 to 1982 there was no programming in the very early morning, and from 1983, when a national breakfast franchise was created, LWT would hand over to TV-am at 6:00am, who would then hand over to Thames at 9:25am). From 1993 to 2002, when LWT's weekday counterpart was Carlton Television, the transfer usually occurred invisibly during a commercial break, as Carlton and LWT shared studio and transmission facilities (although occasionally a Thames to LWT-style handover would appear). Like most ITV regional franchises, including Carlton's, the London weekend franchise is now operated by ITV plc. The London Weekend franchise was renewed by Ofcom in 2015 for a further ten years and is still separately licensed, but it is no longer distinguished on air in any way at all. LWT is now managed with Carlton Television as a single entity (ITV London), and the legal name for LWT is now ITV London (Weekends). London Weekend Television Ltd is now (along with most other former regional companies owned by ITV plc) listed at Companies House as a dormant company.",
  "/wiki/All_Creatures_Great_and_Small_(TV_series)": "All Creatures Great and Small is a British television series based on the books of the British veterinary surgeon Alf Wight, who wrote under the pseudonym James Herriot. In early 1977, the BBC tasked producer Bill Sellars with the creation of a television series from Herriot's first two novels, If Only They Could Talk and It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet, using the title of the 1975 film adaptation. It is part of a series of movies and television series based on Herriot's novels. The Herriot novels were written in an episodic style, with each chapter generally containing a short story within the ongoing narrative of Herriot's life. This format greatly facilitated their adaptation for a television series. The series had two runs: the original (1978 to 1980, based directly on Herriot's books) was for three series; the second (1988 to 1990, filmed with original scripts) for four. A total of ninety episodes were broadcast. Set in the Yorkshire Dales beginning in the mid-1930s, it stars Christopher Timothy as Herriot, Robert Hardy as Siegfried Farnon (based on Donald Sinclair), the proprietor of the Skeldale House surgery, and Peter Davison as Siegfried's little brother, Tristan (based on Brian Sinclair). Herriot's wife, Helen (based on Joan), is played by a different actress in each of the series' runs: Carol Drinkwater originally, then Lynda Bellingham for the revival. The supporting cast, both recurring and one-offs, numbers over 600, most of whom appear as farmers or clients of the surgery.",

His girlfriend, Sonia, is a very serious minded young woman who is passionate only about things like vegetarianism and ecology. When Brian's younger brother, Steve, arrives in London looking for somewhere to stay, his lazy, cynical, noisy Northern lout attitude disrupts Brian's already messy life. Like Only Fools and Horses, Sink or Swim was filmed in Bristol doubling for London. It ran for three series between 4 December 1980 and 14 October 1982 and was written by Alex Shearer, who later wrote the Nicholas Lyndhurst sitcom The Two of Us for LWT from 1986 to 1990.
