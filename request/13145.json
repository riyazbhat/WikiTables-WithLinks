  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine": "Doctor of Medicine (abbreviated M.D., from the Latin Medicinae Doctor) is a medical degree, the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions. In the United States, Canada and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a professional graduate degree awarded upon graduation from medical school. In the United States, this generally arose because many in 18th century medical professions trained in Scotland, which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate, higher doctorate, honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D.",

He shared the prize with Andrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin.",
  "/wiki/James_Watson": "James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist. In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material. Watson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (BS, 1947) and Indiana University (PhD, 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. From 1968 he served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world leading research center in molecular biology.",
  "/wiki/George_Beadle": "George Wells Beadle (October 22, 1903 \u2013 June 9, 1989) was an American geneticist. In 1958 he shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward Tatum for their discovery of the role of genes in regulating biochemical events within cells. He also served as the 7th President of the University of Chicago.\n Beadle and Tatum's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold Neurospora crassa to x-rays, causing mutations.  In a series of experiments, they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways.  These experiments led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the One gene-one enzyme hypothesis.",
  "/wiki/Edward_Tatum": "Edward Lawrie Tatum (December 14, 1909 \u2013 November 5, 1975) was an American geneticist. He shared half of the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 with George Beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in metabolism. The other half of that year's award went to Joshua Lederberg. Beadle and Tatum's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold Neurospora crassa to x-rays, causing mutations. In a series of experiments, they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. These experiments, published in 1941, led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the one gene, one enzyme hypothesis. Tatum went on to study genetics in bacteria. An active area of research in his laboratory was to understand the basis of Tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.",

He invented the first perfusion pump with Charles A. Lindbergh opening the way to organ transplantation. His positive description of an allegedly miraculous healing he witnessed during a pilgrimage earned him scorn of some of his colleagues. This prompted him to relocate to the United States, where he lived most of his life. He had a leading role in implementing eugenic policies in Vichy France .\n A Nobel Prize laureate in 1912, Alexis Carrel was also elected twice, in 1924 and 1927, as an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_affiliated_with_the_University_of_Chicago": "This list of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Chicago comprehensively shows the alumni, faculty members as well as researchers of the University of Chicago who were awarded the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes, established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, are awarded to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. An associated prize, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics), was instituted by Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in 1968 and first awarded in 1969.\n As of October 2019[update], 100 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University of Chicago. Among the 100 laureates, 95 are the laureates of the scientific Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Prize in Economics; 34 are UChicago alumni (graduates and attendees) and 48 have been long-term academic members of the university; and, subject-wise, 33 have won the Nobel Prize in Economics, more than any other subject (for verification, see Summary). This list considers Nobel laureates as equal individuals and does not consider their various prize shares or if they received the prize more than once."
