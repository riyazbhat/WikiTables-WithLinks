It was written soon after the annexation to salvage Arakanese history after most of Mrauk-U's historical records were burned down by Konbaung forces in 1785. Rakhine Sayadaw, a Buddhist monk, tried to piece together the portions that escaped the indiscriminate destruction, and completed it in 1788. According to G.E. Harvey, a British colonial period historian, the chronicle may not be as reliable as it is a third-hand piece of work. The chronicle covers from c. 825 BCE from the reign of legendary King Kanyaza Gyi to the Konbaung annexation in 1785. Like most Arakanese chronicles, this chronicle provides a short account of legendary kings, and starts a more detailed coverage with King Sanda Thuriya (146-198). It also contains many homilies and wise counsels on good governance given to various kings by wise men and ministers. It provides the most detailed accounts, starting with King Pa-Gyi (Min Bin) to the last king of Arakan, Maha Thammada.",

It was written in 1823 by Ne Myo Zeya Kyawhtin, the Konbaung governor of Sandoway (Thandwe), who was born to a Rakhine (Arakanese) father and a Bamar (Burman) mother of Ava royalty. The chronicle consists of three sections. Section I covers the Arakanese/Rakhine resistance from 1785 to 1795, and how it was crushed. Section II covers Chin Byan's rebellion from 1798 to 1811. Part III covers the mission sent by King Bodawpaya to India to collect ancient religious manuscripts as well as to collect intelligence on the British expansion in India. It includes royal orders of Bodawpaya in connection with the mission, records about an Indian princess and her retinue sent to the king, and a royal order to widen the road between Thandwe and Pyay. Historian Yi Yi does not consider this a full-fledged chronicle, pointing out that the author himself had termed it sadan (treatise).",
