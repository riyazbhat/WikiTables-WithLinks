  "/wiki/Schenectady,_New_York": "Schenectady  (/sk\u0259\u02c8n\u025bkt\u0259di/) is a city in Schenectady County, New York, United States, of which it is the county seat. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 66,135. The name Schenectady is derived from a Mohawk word, skahn\u00e9htati, meaning beyond the pines. Schenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many from the Albany area. They were prohibited from the fur trade by the Albany monopoly, which kept its control after the English takeover in 1664. Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river. Connected to the west via the Mohawk River and Erie Canal, Schenectady developed rapidly in the 19th century as part of the Mohawk Valley trade, manufacturing and transportation corridor. By 1824 more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade, and the city had a cotton mill, processing cotton from the Deep South.",

At one time, NY 146 had three spur routes; only one\u2014NY 146A\u2014still exists. NY 146 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the time, NY 146 began at modern NY 443 in Berne and followed what is now NY 156 northeast to Altamont while modern NY 146 west of Altamont was part of NY 156. The alignments of the two routes were flipped in the late 1930s.",
