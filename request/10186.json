It is controlled by the Portuguese Football Federation, the governing body for football in Portugal. Portugal's first participation in a major tournament finals was at the 1966 World Cup, which saw a team featuring Ballon d'Or winner Eus\u00e9bio finish in third place.

Portugal also made it to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 1984 final tournament, losing 3\u20132 after extra time to the hosts and eventual winners France. During this time, Portugal was not part of a group of teams that were candidates to win titles, but from 2000 until this present day, the team evolved, being present in all the final stages of major tournaments, due to the presence of several world-class players such as Lu\u00eds Figo, Rui Costa, Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who were dubbed as Portugal's golden generation, who were considered as the best of the world at their time and among the best in history. Portugal's golden generation helped Portugal reach the semi-finals of Euro 2000, losing 2\u20131 after extra time to eventual winners France, securing the second place at Euro 2004 Final after losing to Greece on home soil, as well reaching the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup losing to finalist France, after a penalty, leading Portugal to secure the fourth place in the tournament, after losing to 3\u20131 to hosts Germany, thus being the best result since the 1966 World Cup. Despite losing many players of the golden generation, new players such as F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Nani and Pepe helped the Portuguese reach the semi-finals of Euro 2012, losing to Spain in penalties, with Cristiano Ronaldo finishing as joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals.",
