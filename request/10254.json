  "/wiki/Free_Will_Baptist_Church_of_Auburn": "The Auburn Free Will Baptist Church is a historic former Baptist church building in Auburn Township, Geauga County, Ohio, United States.  Constructed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, it is no longer home to the congregation that built it, but it remains a significant component of the area's built environment, and it has been named a historic site.\n The Auburn Free Will Baptist Church was formed in 1839 or 1840, led by an Elder Miller as the first pastor.  The congregation was able to build a church building by the end of 1840, but forty years later the congregation remained weak enough that they were forced to share their pastor with another church.:218  Before the building was finished, the church often worshipped in a schoolhouse or in a barn belonging to farmer Richard Slitor.:463  After its construction, it was used both by Baptists and by the Methodists for most of the rest of the century, and the Baptists continued worshipping in it until the era of the Second World War.\n Built with clapboarded walls on a foundation of sandstone, the church is most distinctive for its roofline and the roof's structural support.  From the outside, the roof resembles an ordinary gable roof, but an unusual system of trusses and diagonal bracing supports the underside of the roof.  Local historians have deemed this construction style particularly rare in the Connecticut Western Reserve.  With this exception, it is typical of the region's vernacular Greek Revival churches; three windows appear on the sides and on the second story of the front, while the main entrance is centered between a window on each side of the front's first floor.  A tower once sat atop the front of the building.\n In May 1976, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically distinctive architecture and because of its place in local history.  It is the only National Register-listed location in Auburn Township, and one of three Geauga County churches with this designation, along with the Claridon Congregational Church in Claridon Township and the South Newbury Union Chapel in Newbury Township.",

The fellow founder of Columbia and pioneer, soldier, and legislator Ephraim Kibbey (1756-1809) is memorialized here on the monument \"To the First Boat-load\" erected in 1879.\n Frederick L. Payne, then Supervising Horticulturalist for the Park Board, began a restoration project in 1967 for the cemetery.\n The cemetery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under its historic name of \"Columbia Baptist Cemetery\".\n Since 1958, the Pioneer Cemetery has been known as an archaeological site \u2014 in that year, evidence was discovered that the terrace upon which the cemetery lies was once a Native American village site.  Due to the presence of the cemetery, no excavation has ever been conducted there; consequently, all that is known about the village is that it was inhabited during the Woodland period.",
  "/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio": "Cincinnati (/\u02ccs\u026ans\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6ti/ SIN-sih-NAT-ee) is a major city in the U.S. state of Ohio, and is the government seat of Hamilton County. Settled in 1788, the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers, the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky. The city is the economic and cultural hub of the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the fastest growing economic power in the Midwestern United States based on increase of economic output, which had a population of 2,190,209 as of the 2018 census estimates. This makes it Ohio's largest metropolitan area and the nation's 29th-largest. With a city population estimated at 302,605, Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and 65th in the United States. Cincinnati is also within a day's drive of 49.70% of the United States populace, the most of any  city in the United States.\n In the 19th century, Cincinnati was an American boomtown in the middle of the country. Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by New Orleans and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the sixth-biggest city for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the American Revolution, as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n Cincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly Chicago, which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and St. Louis, which for decades after the Civil War served as the gateway to westward migration.\n Cincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball; the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League; and  FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer.  The city's largest institution of higher education, the University of Cincinnati, was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States. Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years. In the late 1800s, Cincinnati was commonly referred to as the \"Paris of America\", due mainly to such ambitious architectural projects as the Music Hall, Cincinnatian Hotel, and Shillito Department Store. Cincinnati is the birthplace of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States.",

One of the oldest black churches in the city, it has been active since the 1860s, and its 1920s building has been named a historic site.\n Built of brick on a concrete foundation, the Gothic Revival church features limestone details and is covered with an asphalt roof.  The major part of the church is on the second story, sitting above a basement with windows at ground level; the main part of the building is entered through large doors atop a flight of exterior stairs.  Squat rectangular towers with pyramidal roofs sit on the front corners of the building, with simple rectangular windows above small doorways.  The plan partially reflects traditional ecclesiastical architecture, with a gabled roof being interrupted by cross gables on the sides.  Many of the windows, as well as the doorways, are wide ogive arches.\n Shiloh Baptist Church was formed by a group of former members of the city's Second Baptist Church.  Seeing the city's black population increasing rapidly, especially on the near east side, Second Baptist leaders asked for volunteers to leave and form a new church; these volunteers formed the entire charter membership of the new Shiloh church.  From their first meeting in 1869 until 1871, they worshipped in a rented property at Gay and Fourth Streets downtown, after which they moved a few blocks eastward to Cleveland Avenue and Long Street.  The congregation again moved in 1923 upon the completion of the present building on Mount Vernon Avenue, significantly farther east than the previous houses of worship.  A minister, James Burks, was responsible for the design, with additional work being performed by the A.O. Day Construction Company.  The congregation came close to losing the building during the Great Depression, due to its inability to pay the mortgage, but was delivered by an unexpected act of mercy: upon obtaining title through foreclosure, the bank promptly contracted to return the property to the church.  Since that time, the building has become recognized as one of the premier components of the surrounding neighborhood, Mount Vernon.\n As the third oldest black church in Columbus, younger only than the parent church and a congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the congregation has long played a significant part in the life of Mount Vernon.  In recognition of its significance in local history, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  The congregation remains active in the wider Baptist community as a part of the Eastern Union Missionary Baptist Association.",
