  "/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese": "Mandarin (/\u02c8m\u00e6nd\u0259r\u026an/ (listen); simplified Chinese: \u5b98\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u5b98\u8a71; pinyin: Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0; literally: 'speech of officials') is a group of related Sinitic languages spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin. Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects (\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd; b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0). Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly a billion).",
