  "/wiki/2007\u201308_ECHL_season": "The 2007\u201308 ECHL season was the 20th season of the ECHL. Two teams suspended operations at the end of the 2006\u201307 season, the Long Beach Ice Dogs and the Toledo Storm. Toledo's suspension was granted after Toledo Arena Sports, Inc. acquired the Storm and requested a suspension of the team for two years in order to allow a new arena to be built in downtown Toledo to open in 2009 in time for the team to return to play. The league officially welcomed back the Mississippi Sea Wolves, who had to suspend operations for two seasons (2005\u201307) because of damage to the Mississippi Coast Coliseum caused by Hurricane Katrina. The Elmira Jackals also joined the ECHL after being in the United Hockey League for their previous existence. Another established team, the Trenton, New Jersey franchise, entered its ninth season with a new name. The team, now owned by the NHL New Jersey Devils, adopted the Devils nickname. Before the start of the season, the league announced that it would hand out a new award to honor on-ice referees for their dedication and contribution to the league, through the Ryan Birmingham Memorial Award.",
