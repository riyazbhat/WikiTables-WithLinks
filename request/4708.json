  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome (Latin and Italian: Roma [\u02c8ro\u02d0ma] (listen)) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy (named Comune di Roma Capitale). Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region. With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's most populated comune. It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents, thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states.\nRome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city  successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Citt\u00e0 Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called \"Caput Mundi\" (Capital of the World). After the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447\u20131455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. In this way, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Italian Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.\n As of 2019, Rome is ranked as an Alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. In 2019, Rome was the 11th most visited city in the world, third most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy. Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  Host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialized agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many international business companies such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo S.p.A., and national and international banks such as Unicredit and BNL. Rome's EUR business district is the home of many companies involved in the oil industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and financial services.

It is bordered by Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland and Italy to the east, and Andorra and Spain to the south. The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The country's 18 integral regions (five of which are situated overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and a total population of 67.02 million (as of July 2019[update]). France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice. France, including its overseas territories, has the most number of time zones of any country, with a total of 12.\n During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476, who formed the Kingdom of Francia. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia. West Francia, which became the Kingdom of France in 987, emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, following its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453). During the Renaissance, French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world. The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV. In the late 18th century, the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy, establishing one of modern history's earliest republics and drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day.\n In the 19th century, Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire. His subsequent Napoleonic Wars (1803\u201315) shaped the course of continental Europe. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870. France was a major participant in World War I, from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allies in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis powers in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains today. Algeria and nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s, with most retaining close economic and military connections with France.\n France has long been a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the leading tourist destination, receiving around 83 million foreign visitors annually, but if it counted the nights spent by non-residents tourist, France become the sixth country in world with 138 millions of nights, behind United States, China, Spain, Italy and United Kingdom. France is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP, and tenth-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world. France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development.

These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. They adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary, among many others.[failed verification] \n Francis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a new religious order.  The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the Pope did not allow ownership of property, requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching.  The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.  Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets, while staying in church properties.  Saint Clare, under Francis's guidance, founded the Poor Clares (Order of Saint Clare) in 1212, which remains a Second Order of the Franciscans.\n The extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the Rule in 1223.  The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order, resulting in numerous secessions. The Order of Friars Minor, previously known as the \"Observant\" branch, is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church, the others being the \"Conventuals\" (formed 1517) and \"Capuchins\" (1520).  The Order of Friars Minor, in its current form, is the result of an amalgamation of several smaller orders completed in 1897 by Pope Leo XIII.  The latter two, the Capuchin and Conventual, remain distinct religious institutes within the Catholic Church, observing the Rule of Saint Francis with different emphases.

Caetani was of baronial origin with family connections to the papacy.\nHe succeeded Pope Celestine V, a Benedictine, who had resigned from the papal throne. Boniface spent his early career abroad in diplomatic roles. In the College of Cardinals, he discriminated not only against the Benedictines but also members of the Colonna family, some of whom had contested the validity of the 1294 papal conclave that elected him following the unusual resignation of Pope Celestine V. The dispute resulted in battles between troops of Boniface and his adversaries and the deliberate destruction and salting of the town of Palestrina, despite the pope's assurances that the surrendering city would be spared.\n Boniface VIII put forward some of the strongest claims of any pope to temporal as well as spiritual power. He involved himself often with foreign affairs, including in France, Sicily, Italy and the First War of Scottish Independence. These views, and his chronic intervention in \"temporal\" affairs, led to many bitter quarrels with Albert I of Germany, Philip IV of France, and Dante Alighieri, who wrote his treatise De Monarchia to dispute Boniface's claims of papal supremacy and placed the pope in the Eighth Circle of Hell in his Divine Comedy, among the simoniacs.\n Boniface systematized canon law by collecting it in a new volume, Liber Sextus (1298), which continues to be important source material for canon lawyers. He organized the first Catholic \"jubilee\" year to take place in Rome in order to gain political clout over Philip IV of France or make up for loss of funds from him. Boniface had first entered into conflict with Philip IV of France in 1296 when the latter sought to reinforce the nascent nation state by imposing taxes on the clergy and barring them from administration of the law. The conflict escalated when the French arrested and convicted papal legate Bernard Saisset for insurrection. The pope issued a bull, Ausculta Fili, in which he declared that both spiritual and temporal power were under the pope's jurisdiction, and that kings were subordinate to the power of the Roman pontiff. Philip disobeyed and had Ausculta Fili publicly burnt in Paris in 1302. Boniface excommunicated Philip and all others who prevented French clergy from traveling to the Holy See, after which the king sent his troops to attack the pope's residence in Anagni on 7 September 1303 and capture him. Boniface was held for three days and beaten badly.\n Boniface died a month later, on 11 October 1303, of high fever and was buried in a special chapel. Philip IV pressured Pope Clement V of the Avignon Papacy into staging a posthumous trial of Boniface. He was accused of heresy and sodomy. Pope Clement V referred the process to the 1311 Council of Vienne, where two knights challenged the claim to a trial by combat. With no one willing to fight them, the Council declared the matter closed.

  "/wiki/Cr\u00e9cy": "The Battle of Cr\u00e9cy took place on 26 August 1346 in north-east France between a French army commanded by King Philip VI and an English army led by King Edward III. The French attacked the English while they were traversing northern France during the Hundred Years' War resulting in an English victory and heavy loss of life among the French.\n The English army had landed in the Cotentin Peninsula on 12 July. It had burnt a path of destruction through some of the richest lands in France to within 2 miles (3 km) of Paris, sacking many towns on the way. The English then marched north, hoping to link up with an allied Flemish army which had invaded from Flanders. Hearing that the Flemish had turned back, and having temporarily outdistanced the pursuing French, Edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu. Late on 26 August the French army, which greatly outnumbered the English, attacked.\n During a brief archery duel a large force of French mercenary crossbowmen was routed by Welsh and  English longbowmen. The French then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted knights. These were disordered by their impromptu nature, by having to force their way through the fleeing crossbowmen, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attacks were further broken up by the effective fire from the English archers, which caused heavy casualties. By the time the French charges reached the English men-at-arms, who had dismounted for the battle, they had lost much of their impetus. The ensuing hand-to-hand combat was described as \"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible\". The French charges continued late into the night, all with the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French repulse.\n The English then laid siege to the port of Calais. The battle crippled the French army's ability to relieve the siege; the town fell to the English the following year and remained under English rule for more than two centuries, until 1558. Cr\u00e9cy established the effectiveness of the longbow as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield.",

  "/wiki/Guillaume_de_Ferri\u00e8res_(cardinal)": "Guillaume de Ferri\u00e8res (Latin: Guilelmus de Ferrariis, de Fornariis) (born in Provence, at a date unknown; died 7 September 1295 in Perpignan) was a Proven\u00e7al French bureaucrat in the service of King Charles II of Naples, and a Roman Catholic Cardinal.\n Guillaume held the academic rank of Magister. He was Professor of Law at the University of Toulouse, ca. 1284.\n He was Provost of the Church of  Marseille, 1289-1295, and papal Chaplain.  He also held the titles of Consiliarius and Familiaris of King Charles.\n He was Vice-Chancellor of King Charles II of Naples, 1290-1295, in Provence. In a letter written at Aix-en-Provence on 24 November 1290, the Provost Guillaume states that he was operating with the authority of the King by virtue of a special commission.\n On the request of King Charles II, Guillaume de Ferri\u00e8res was created cardinal-priest by Pope Celestine V at a Consistory held at L'Aquila on 18 September 1294; Guillaume was assigned the titular Church of San Clemente in Rome.\n He participated in the Conclave of 1294, following the resignation of Pope Celestine V on 13 December 1294.  On 24 December, the cardinals elected Benedetto Caetani, Cardinal Priest of SS. Silvestro e Martino, who took the name Boniface VIII.\n Cardinal Guillaume was appointed Legate of Boniface VIII on 30 June 1295, and sent to France to de-fuse a quarrel which was beginning between Philip IV of France, Charles II of Sicily, and Charles of Alen\u00e7on and Valois. He was then sent on to Spain to confirm the peace between Charles II of Sicily and King James II of Aragon, and to carry out the investiture for the Kingdom of Valencia and the Kingdom of Aragon. Useful details of the mission are provided by the Register of Guillaume de Mandagot, Archbishop of Embrun. Mandagot had just been consecrated a bishop by Boniface VIII himself on Easter Day, 1295, and he headed north very soon thereafter.  He was in Embrun in the third week of June, where he was received, installed, and offered homage. He then immediately held a synod. But he received a special order from the Pope to proceed to Catalonia, with Cardinal Guillaume de Ferrieres and King Charles II of Naples.  He wound up his affairs and on 30 July set off to meet the party travelling north from Rome.  The party proceeded to Catalonia, joined by the Archbishop of Arles, Rostagne de Capre.  The party met with King James, and the negotiations were concluded.  The agreement was later sealed by the marriage of King James II with the daughter of King Charles II, Blanche of Anjou, on 29 October or 1 November 1295, in the Catalan town of Vilabertran.\n Business concluded, the party began its return journey. Cardinal Guillaume only got as far as Perpignan where he fell ill, and died on 7 September 1295. He was buried in the Franciscan church in that city.  Unaware as yet of his death, Pope Boniface wrote a letter to Cardinal Guillaume on 19 September, in which he remarks on Guillaume's illness and his frustration that the negotiations with King James of Aragon were being delayed.\n On 25 November 1295,  the Treasury of the College of Cardinals paid out to the estate of Cardinal Guilelmus de Fornariis his share of a donation made by the Abbot of the Monastery of S. Giorgio in Venice.  The estate did not, however, share in the distribution of money from the Rector of the Comtat Venaissin because Cardinal Guillaume had died before Michaelmas.  The estate was still receiving distributions from money owed during Cardinal Guillaume's lifetime but not paid until well after his death; on 12 March 1296, he received money given by the Abbot of Cluny, and at Eastertide money given by the Archbishop of Tours.",

It largely corresponds with the modern administrative region of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur and includes the departments of Var, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, as well as parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille.\n The Romans made the region the first Roman province beyond the Alps and called it Provincia Romana, which evolved into the present name. Until 1481 it was ruled by the Counts of Provence from their capital in Aix-en-Provence, then became a province of the Kings of France. While it has been part of France for more than five hundred years, it still retains a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, particularly in the interior of the region.",
  "/wiki/Crown-cardinal": "A crown-cardinal (Italian: cardinale della corona) was a cardinal protector of a Roman Catholic nation, nominated or funded by a Catholic monarch to serve as their representative within the College of Cardinals and, on occasion, to exercise the right claimed by some monarchs to veto a candidate for election to the papacy. More generally, the term may refer to any cardinal significant as a secular statesman or elevated at the request of a monarch.\n Francis Burkle-Young defines a crown cardinal as one \"elevated to the cardinalate solely on the recommendation of the European kings and without, in many cases, having performed any service at all for the advance of the Church.\"\n According to conclave historian Frederic Baumgartner, the crown-cardinals \"rarely came to Rome except for the conclaves, if then, and they were largely unknown to the majority of the College. Usually unable to take part in the pratiche, they were not papabili and rarely received more than one or two votes\". Crown-cardinals generally opposed the election of crown-cardinals from other kingdoms, although they tended to unite against the election of cardinal-nephews.\n Opposition to national cardinal protectors arose in the fifteenth century due to the perceived conflict of interest, and Pope Martin V attempted to forbid them entirely in 1425. A reform of Pope Pius II dated 1464 regards national cardinal protectors as generally inconsistent with curial responsibility, with several exceptions. Such protectorships were first openly permitted by popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI, both of whom required the explicit written consent of the pontiff for a cardinal to take up a \"position of service to a secular prince\". An unnamed cardinal even suggested elevating national cardinal protectors to a full and official position in the Roman Curia, equivalent to an ambassador.",

He was the son of Charles I of Anjou\u2014one of the most powerful European monarchs in the second half of the 13th century\u2014and Beatrice of Provence. His father granted Charles the Principality of Salerno in the Kingdom of Sicily (or Regno) in 1272 and made him regent in Provence and Forcalquier in 1279.\n After the uprising known as the Sicilian Vespers against Charles' father, the island of Sicily became an independent kingdom under the rule of Peter III of Aragon in 1282. A year later, his father made Charles regent in the mainland territories of the Regno (or the Kingdom of Naples). Charles held a general assembly where unpopular taxes were abolished and the liberties of the noblemen and clerics were confirmed. He could not prevent the Aragonese from occupying Calabria and the islands in the Gulf of Naples. The Sicilian admiral, Roger of Lauria, captured him in a naval battle near Naples in 1284. As he was still in prison when his father died on 7 January 1285, his realms were ruled by regents.",

By virtue of his marriage with Joan I of Navarre, he was also King of Navarre as Philip I from 1284 to 1305, as well as Count of Champagne. Although Philip was known as handsome, hence the epithet le Bel, his rigid and inflexible personality gained him (from friend and foe alike) other nicknames, such as the Iron King (French: le Roi de fer). His fierce opponent Bernard Saisset, bishop of Pamiers, said of him: \"he is neither man nor beast. He is a statue.\"[a]\n Philip relied on skillful civil servants, such as Guillaume de Nogaret and Enguerrand de Marigny, to govern the kingdom rather than on his nobles. Philip and his advisors were instrumental in the transformation of France from a feudal country to a centralized state. The king, who sought an uncontested monarchy, compelled his vassals by wars and restricted feudal usages. His ambitions made him highly influential in European affairs. His goal was to place his relatives on foreign thrones. Princes from his house ruled in Naples and Hungary. He tried and failed to make another relative the Holy Roman Emperor.  He began the long advance of France eastward by taking control of scattered fiefs.\n The most notable conflicts of Philip's reign include a dispute with the English over King Edward I's fiefs in southwestern France, and a war with the Flemish, who had rebelled against French royal authority and humiliated Philip at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302 but resulted with Philip's ultimate victory with which he received a significant portion of Flemish cities that were added to the crown lands along with a vast sum of money. In 1306, Philip expelled the Jews from France, and in 1307 he annihilated the order of the Knights Templar. He was in debt to both groups and saw them as a \"state within the state\". To further strengthen the monarchy, Philip tried to take control of the French clergy, leading to a violent conflict with Pope Boniface VIII. This conflict resulted in the transfer of the papal court to the  enclave of Avignon in 1309.\n His final year saw a scandal amongst the royal family, known as the Tour de Nesle affair, in which Philip's three daughters-in-law were accused of adultery. His three sons were successively kings of France, Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV. Their deaths without surviving sons of their own would compromise the future of the French royal house, which until then seemed secure, precipitating a succession crisis that would eventually lead to the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453).",

His ecclesiastical career lasted 57 years, 54 of them as a cardinal, and included six conclaves.\n Born in Rome to Rinaldo Orsini, Lord of Monterotondo and of Marino, son of Matteo Rosso Orsini 'il Grande'; and Ocilenda, perhaps the daughter of Stefano II Conti, perhaps of a member of the house of Boveschi.  Rinaldo was a brother of Pope Nicholas III and of Cardinal Giordano Orsini.  Napoleone took holy orders in 1285 and was named a papal sub-chaplain by Honorius IV.  He is attested as Papal Chaplain on February 18, 1286.   He rose quickly in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and in a Consistory held by Pope Nicholas IV  on 16 May 1288, he was appointed a Cardinal Deacon and assigned the Deaconry of  S. Adriano.\n During the pontificate of Boniface VIII his gift for diplomacy was put to wide use and he was named legate to Spoleto and Ancona on 27 May 1300. In this capacity, in 1301, he retook the city of Gubbio, which had rebelled against the Papal State. An opponent of the Colonna family, he was a supporter of Boniface' Italian crusades.\n From 1303 to 1341 Cardinal Napoleone was Prebend of Sutton cum Buckingham in the diocese of Lincoln. He was appointed Canon and Prebend of Suthcave in the Church of York (before September 21, 1304), a benefice which he held until 1342.\n In 1305, after the Conclave of 1304-1305 and two weeks after his coronation, the new Pope, Clement V, made him Archpriest of S.

There was, to be sure, a long intermission in the proceedings, caused by multiple forces which began with dissensions among the retinues of the cardinals, included an attempt to set fire to the Conclave, and the direct involvement of the Royal family of France. The Conclave finally elected a Gascon, Cardinal Jacques Du\u00e8se on 7 August 1314.  He was crowned in the Cathedral of S. Etienne in Lyon on 5 September 1316.\n Immediately after the election, even before the Coronation,  Cardinal Napoleone managed to obtain from the new Pope for the benefit of his cousin Paul de Comite, a Papal Chaplain, the reversion of a canonry and prebend in the Church of Lichfield; and for the benefit of another cousin Peter de Comite the confirmation of a Canonry and prebend in the Church of London.\n In the Conclave of 1334, following the death of Pope John XXII, he participated as senior Cardinal Deacon, prior Diaconum. The Conclave began on 13 December 1334 in the Apostolic Palace in Avignon with twenty-four cardinals in attendance.  On the evening of 20 December 1334, they chose Cardinal Jacques Fournier, O.Cist., of Savardun near Toulouse, in the Diocese of Pamiers, who adopted the name Benedict XII.
