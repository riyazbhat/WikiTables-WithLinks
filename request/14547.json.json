  "/wiki/Rockville_Stone_Chapel": "An outgrowth of local camp meetings, Rockville Stone Chapel was constructed in the Fall of 1856, in use by Christmas of that year, and dedicated in February 1857.  Divisions in the congregation over slavery soon split the congregation, with the Northern faction splitting off at Christmas Eve 1863 to form their own church.  Attendance at the chapel slowly declined, with the last resident pastor leaving in 1895.  Although services continued sporadically, the building fell into disrepair and, in 1929, the chapel was donated to the County of Solano.  With the onset of the Great Depression that year, restoration did not occur for another decade, with the WPA finally accomplishing a full renovation in the Spring of 1940.  Declared a State Historical Landmark in October 1962, the chapel continues in use today (2019), serving as the sanctuary for the local Church of Christ congregation and also hosting weddings and funerals.",
