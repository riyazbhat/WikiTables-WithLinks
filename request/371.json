Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos (\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) \"end\" and mer\u03bfs (\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, root: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1-) \"part\". For vertebrates, the sequence of nucleotides in telomeres is AGGGTT, with the complementary DNA strand being TCCCAA, with a single-stranded TTAGGG overhang. This sequence of TTAGGG is repeated approximately 2,500 times in humans. In humans, average telomere length declines from about 11 kilobases at birth to fewer than 4 kilobases in old age, with the average rate of decline being greater in men than in women.",
