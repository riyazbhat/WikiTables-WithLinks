Bernard began operating a ferry at the site in 1884. He opened a road, utilizing the ferry, between mining town of Silver City and the Oregon Short Line railhead at Caldwell. A hotel and horse barn at this site were built to serve the stagecoach and freight lines which used the road and ferry. Bernard's ventures were successful until a bridge was built at Walter's Ferry in 1920. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

  "/wiki/Snake_River": "The Snake River is a major river of the greater Pacific Northwest region in the United States. At 1,078 miles (1,735 km) long, it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River, in turn the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Snake River rises in western Wyoming, then flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho,  the rugged Hells Canyon on the Oregon\u2013Idaho border and the rolling Palouse Hills of Washington, emptying into the Columbia River at the Tri-Cities, Washington. The Snake River drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states and is known for its varied geologic history. The Snake River Plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath the Snake River headwaters in Yellowstone National Park. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out canyons, cliffs and waterfalls along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events, the Missoula Floods and Bonneville Flood, significantly affected the river and its surroundings. Prehistoric Native Americans lived along the Snake starting more than 11,000 years ago.",
