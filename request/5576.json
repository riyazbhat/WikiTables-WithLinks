  "/wiki/Hartford_City,_Indiana": "Hartford City is a city in the U.S. state of Indiana, and the county seat of Blackford County. Located in the northeast central portion of the state, the small farming community experienced a 15-year boom beginning in the late 1880s. The Indiana Gas Boom was caused by the discovery of natural gas in the area, and it caused the community to transition from an agricultural economy to one that also included manufacturing. The boom brought residents, retail establishments, and craftspeople. The increased population meant construction of new roads, schools, and churches. After the boom came a long period of growth and stability. Agriculture (and agricultural trade) remained as the fundamental industry. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Hartford City continued to thrive. Agricultural automation and consolidation of small farms into industrial-size farms started a decline in the population as the small farmer became unable to compete and fewer people were required as laborers. Some workers turned to the manufacturing and construction sectors for employment in\nnearby cities. However, manufacturing hubs like Muncie and Marion saw the collapse of their economies when large factories closed. Despite the decline, Hartford City was able to retain its paper company, 3M.",

River access assisted heavy industrial development such as that of the Studebaker Corporation, the Oliver Chilled Plow Company, and other large corporations. The population of South Bend declined after 1960, when it had a peak population of 132,445. This was chiefly due to migration to suburban areas as well as the demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry. Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, small business, and tourism. Remaining large corporations include Crowe, Honeywell, and AM General. Recently, the city population has begun to grow for the first time in nearly fifty years."
