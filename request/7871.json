  "/wiki/Fiscal_year": "A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes budget year)  is used in government accounting, which varies between countries, and for budget purposes. It is also used for financial reporting by businesses and other organizations. Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis, but generally do not require the reporting period to align with the calendar year (1 January to 31 December). Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes. The calculation of tax on an annual basis is especially relevant for direct taxation, such as income tax. Many annual government fees\u2014such as Council rates, license fees, etc.\u2014are also levied on a fiscal year basis, while others are charged on an anniversary basis. Some companies\u2014such as Cisco Systems\u2014end their fiscal year on the same day of the week each year, i.e. the day that is closest to a particular date (for example, the Friday closest to 31 December).",
