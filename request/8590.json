  "/wiki/Rock_Around_the_Clock": "\"Rock Around the Clock\" is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers (the latter being under the pseudonym \"Jimmy De Knight\") in 1952. The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954 for American Decca. It was a number one single on both the United States and United Kingdom charts and also reentered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s.\n It was not the first rock and roll record, nor was it the first successful record of the genre (Bill Haley had American chart success with \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" in 1953, and in 1954, \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" sung by Big Joe Turner reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart). Haley's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and is widely considered to be the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world. The song is ranked No. 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n Although it was first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20, 1954, Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but, for various reasons, Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12, 1954.\n The original full title of the song was \"We're Gonna Rock Around the Clock Tonight!\". This was later shortened to \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\", though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others (including Sonny Dae) shorten this title further to \"Rock Around the Clock\".\n In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\"",

From late 1954 to late 1956, the group placed nine singles in the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten. The single \"Rock Around the Clock\" became the biggest selling rock and roll single in the history of the genre.\n Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country music performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats \"Rocket 88\", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock and roll.\n Although several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star. With his spit curl and the band's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior, many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as the Beatles were a decade later.\n Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.",

The song continued to chart in the 21st century, and it was the only song to reach number one with four different recordings in the UK until it was joined by Band Aid 30's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" in 2014.\n Of the hundreds of recordings made, the Righteous Brothers' version in July 1965, with a solo by Bobby Hatfield, became the jukebox standard after its release. Hatfield changed the melody in the final verse and many subsequent covers of the song are based on his version.

Because M-G-M had already had three major songs scheduled in sequence for release (\"My Love, My Love\" and \"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"I Need You Now,\" all done at the same recording session!) when the Fisher version was released, it was not possible for M-G-M to market the James original at that point.

It is based on an earlier song called \"Let Me Go, Devil\", about alcoholism. \n \"Let Me Go, Lover\" was featured on the television program Studio One on November 15, 1954, and caught the fancy of the public. The episode was a murder mystery that revolved around a hit record and a disc jockey. Producer Felix Jackson asked Columbia Records' Mitch Miller for a recording to use in the show, and Miller provided Joan Weber's version of \"Let Me Go, Lover\". Miller took advantage of the recording's exposure on national television and sent copies of the record to 2,000 disc jockeys, who began to play it on their radio stations.\n Weber was pregnant when she recorded the song. A result of the program was to illustrate how efficiently a song could be promoted by introducing it to the public via radio or a TV production. The recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 40366. Mitch Miller stocked national record stores the week before the program and because of its availability the record sold over 100,000 the first week of its release. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 4, 1954. By January 1955, Weber's record of the song had hit No. 1 on all the Billboard charts (the Disk Jockey chart, the Best Seller chart, and the Juke Box chart).

The studio also urged Tiomkin to come up with a theme song for the film, to be released to radio and as a vinyl record. Tiomkin formed the basic melody to the song and enlisted songwriter Ned Washington to write the song's lyrics. What resulted was a gentle ballad. Warner Bros. presented the song to Les Baxter and his orchestra, who recorded and released the song to coincide with the release of the film. When released in 1954, \"The High and the Mighty\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Pop chart. \n Both the film score and the song were nominated for Academy Awards in 1955. The song, which ultimately did not win an award, was sung by Johnny Desmond, accompanied by Muzzy Marcellino at the Awards Television show. Dimitri Tiomkin's score won the Academy Award that year.\n Toward the end of the film, after John Wayne's character convinced the captain to try to make it to San Francisco rather than ditch, the captain said \"Whistle me a tune, Dan. I like music when I work.\" Dan (John Wayne) whistled a bit of \"I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech\" (Georgia Tech's famous and catchy fight song). Audiences at the time no doubt immediately recognized it and understood it was a sign of success, as Georgia Tech was in its glory years in football under Bobby Dodd, during which it won six bowl games in six years and was named National Champion by one organization in 1952.\n A second and much rarer version of the title song lyrics also exists. In contrast to the romantic motif of the popular hit tune, the secondary version is instead a paean to the crews who guide the  airliners through the night skies towards distant cities, and concludes with an allusion to the \"high and mighty\" as the Deity. \n An instrumental version was also recorded in 1954 by the conductor and arranger LeRoy Holmes, reaching #9 on the Billboard chart. It became Holmes' biggest hit, and his most recognizable. The song is known for its distinctive whistling, which accompanies the music, and which was provided by Fred Lowery. (The whistling within the film itself was dubbed by Muzzy Marcellino.) Yet another hit version was recorded by Victor Young and his orchestra in 1954, peaking at #6 on the Billboard chart, and Harry James recorded a version in 1955 on his album Jukebox Jamboree (Columbia CL 615).

The song's refrain is based on the aria Un bel d\u00ec vedremo from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera, Madama Butterfly.\n The music was commissioned for the movie Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing and initially included in the film's Oscar-winning score, composed and conducted by Alfred Newman. Lyrics were subsequently added to make it eligible for the Best Original Song category of the Academy Awards. The original lyrics were rejected by the studio so new ones were written.\n The best-selling version of the song was recorded by The Four Aces backed by the Jack Pleis Orchestra and issued by Decca Records as catalog number 29625. It reached number two in the UK Singles Chart, and number one on both Billboard and Cash Box in 1955. The recording by The Four Aces is featured in the film Cookie (1989). It became a gold record.[citation needed]\n This song has been a staple of Engelbert Humperdinck's live show since 1995.",
  "/wiki/The_Student_Prince_(film)": "The Student Prince is a 1954 American musical film directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Ann Blyth and Edmund Purdom, with John Ericson, Louis Calhern, Edmund Gwenn, S. Z. Sakall, and Betta St. John. The film is an adaptation of the 1924 operetta of the same name composed by Sigmund Romberg with lyrics by Dorothy Donnelly, with the screenplay by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig.\n Based on the stage play Old Heidelberg by Wilhelm Meyer-F\u00f6rster (itself an adaptation of his obscure 1898 novel Karl Heinrich), the film is about a brash young prince of a small German kingdom, who must choose between his romance with a barmaid and his impending royal duties. It was filmed and released in CinemaScope and Ansco Color.\n The film gained some infamy during production when original star Mario Lanza left the project before principal photography, necessitating his last-minute replacement by the lesser-known Purdom. Due to the contractual agreement between studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lanza, songs that the actor had already recorded were used in the film, dubbing over Purdom's actual voice.",
  "/wiki/Mario_Lanza": "Mario Lanza (US: /\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0nz\u0259, \u02c8l\u00e6nz\u0259/, Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8lantsa]; born Alfredo Arnold Cocozza [ko\u02c8k\u0254ttsa]; January 31, 1921\u00a0\u2013 October 7, 1959) was an American tenor of Italian ancestry, and an actor and Hollywood film star of the late 1940s and the 1950s.\n Lanza began studying to be a professional singer at the age of 16. After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year film contract with Louis B. Mayer, the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Prior to that, the adult Lanza had sung only two performances of an opera. The following year (1948), however, he sang the role of Pinkerton in Puccini's Madame Butterfly in New Orleans.\n His film d\u00e9but for MGM was in That Midnight Kiss (1949) with Kathryn Grayson and Ethel Barrymore. A year later, in The Toast of New Orleans, his featured popular song \"Be My Love\" became his first million-selling hit. In 1951, he played the role of tenor Enrico Caruso, his idol, in the biopic The Great Caruso, which produced another million-seller with \"The Loveliest Night of the Year\" (a song which used the melody of Sobre las Olas). The Great Caruso was the top-grossing film that year.\n The title song of his next film, Because You're Mine, was his final million-selling hit song. The song went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. After recording the soundtrack for his next film, The Student Prince, he embarked upon a protracted battle with studio head Dore Schary arising from artistic differences with director Curtis Bernhardt, and was eventually dismissed by MGM.\n Lanza was known to be \"rebellious, tough, and ambitious.\" During most of his film career, he suffered from addictions to overeating and alcohol which had a serious effect on his health and his relationships with directors, producers and, occasionally, other cast members. Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper writes that \"his smile, which was as big as his voice, was matched with the habits of a tiger cub, impossible to housebreak.\" She adds that he was the \"last of the great romantic performers\". He made three more films before dying of an apparent pulmonary embolism at the age of 38. At the time of his death in 1959 he was still \"the most famous tenor in the world\". Author Eleonora Kimmel concludes that Lanza \"blazed like a meteor whose light lasts a brief moment in time\".",
  "/wiki/The_Naughty_Lady_of_Shady_Lane": "\"The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane\" is a popular song written by Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett. The lyrics suggest that this \"naughty lady\" driving the whole town crazy is an attractive young woman who \"throws those come-hither glances at every Tom, Dick and Joe\" and \"when offered some liquid refreshment never says no\"; but the last line reveals her to be an infant \"nine days old\".\n Popular versions of the song were the 1954 recordings by The Ames Brothers and by Archie Bleyer.\n The recording by The Ames Brothers was made on September 8, 1954. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5897. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on November 20, 1954.

The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on November 24, 1954 and lasted 5 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 26.

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150\u00a0million records worldwide.\n Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958) and Nice 'n' Easy (1960).\n Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums.

It was written for and first performed by Fred Astaire in the 1955 musical film Daddy Long Legs, and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1955 as Best Original Song, losing to \"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\".\n The song playfully uses the irresistible force paradox \u2013 which asks what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object \u2013 as a metaphor for a relationship between a vivacious woman and an older, world-weary man. The man, it is implied, will give in to temptation and kiss the woman.
