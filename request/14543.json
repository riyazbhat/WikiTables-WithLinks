They competed in 2008 Malaysia FAM League and achieved promotion to Malaysia Premier League for 2009 season. The club was then also promoted to Malaysia Super League after just one season in second division and then competed in 2010 Malaysia Super League. The club was further rebranded as T-Team Titans to gather local support. The team quickly gained popularity among the local football fans as everyone's favourite underdog. As the team kept surpassing the pundits' and supporters' expectations season after season they also showed that they were more than capable of competing and beating Malaysia's heavyweights (JDT, Pahang and Kedah) even with their tight budget and often young squad."
