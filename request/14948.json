  "/wiki/Whey": "Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is a byproduct of the manufacture of cheese or casein and has several commercial uses. Sweet whey is a byproduct produced during the manufacture of rennet types of hard cheese, like cheddar or Swiss cheese. Acid whey (also known as sour whey) is a byproduct produced during the making of acid types of dairy products, such as cottage cheese or strained yogurt.\n Whey proteins consist of \u03b1-lactalbumin, \u03b2-lactoglobulin, serum albumin, immunoglobulins, and proteose-peptones.",
  "/wiki/Milkfat": "Butterfat or milkfat  is the fatty portion of milk.  Milk and cream are often sold according to the amount of butterfat they contain.",
  "/wiki/Milk_protein": "Milk is a nutrient-rich, white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who are breastfed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon, particularly among humans, many of whom consume the milk of other mammals. As an agricultural product, milk, also called dairy milk, is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk, and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products.",
  "/wiki/Cheese": "Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature. Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged for.",
  "/wiki/Korb\u00e1\u010diky": "Korb\u00e1\u010dik (IPA: [korba\u02d0t\u0361\u0283ik]) is a type of semi-hard or medium hard string cheese. It originates from the Orava region of northern Slovakia. It is made from smoked cheese interwoven into fine braids. The name roughly translates to little whip which refers to the pattern woven onto the strings.",
  "/wiki/Oaxaca_cheese": "Oaxaca cheese (Spanish: queso Oaxaca) more commonly referred to as Quesillo is a white, semihard cheese from Mexico, similar to unaged Monterey jack, but with a mozzarella-like string cheese texture. Outside Mexico, Oaxaca cheese is often confused with asadero  (queso asadero), a cheese produced in the northern state of Chihuahua. They are similar in texture and taste, but they are produced with different methods, making Oaxaca cheese slightly drier. It is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made. The string cheese process (pasta filata), originally from Italy, which is used to produce mozzarella, was brought to Mexico by the Dominican friars that settled in Oaxaca. As water buffalo milk was unavailable, they used cow's milk, instead. The cheese is available in several different shapes. The production process is complicated and involves stretching the cheese into long ribbons and rolling it up like a ball of yarn.",
  "/wiki/Obatzda": "Obatzda [\u02c8o\u02d0batsd\u0250] (also  spelt Obazda and Obatzter)[citation needed] is a Bavarian cheese delicacy. It is prepared by mixing two thirds aged soft cheese, usually Camembert (Romadur or similar cheeses may be used as well) and one third butter. Sweet or hot paprika powder, salt and pepper are the traditional seasonings, as well as a small amount of beer. An optional amount of onions, garlic, horseradish, cloves and ground caraway seeds may be used and some cream or cream cheese as well. The cheeses and spices are mixed together into a smooth mass. It is usually eaten spread on bread or pretzels. Obatzda is a classic example of Bavarian biergarten food. A similar Austrian/Hungarian/Slovak recipe is called Liptauer which uses fresh curd cheese as a substitute for the soft cheeses and the butter, but uses about the same spice mix.",
  "/wiki/Processed_cheese": "Processed cheese (also known as prepared cheese, cheese product, plastic cheese or cheese singles) is a food product made from cheese and other unfermented dairy ingredients mixed with emulsifiers. Additional ingredients, such as vegetable oils, salt, food coloring, or sugar may be included. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist. Its invention is credited to Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland, in 1911.",
  "/wiki/String_cheese": "String cheese refers to several different types of cheese where the manufacturing process aligns the proteins in the cheese, which makes it stringy.  \n When mozzarella is heated to 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F)  and then stretched, the milk proteins line up. It is possible to peel strings or strips from the larger cheese.",
