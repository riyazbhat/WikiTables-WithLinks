(Slovene: Houston, imamo problem!) is a 2016 internationally co-produced docufiction-mockumentary film by Slovene director \u017diga Virc. The film explores the myth of the secret multibillion-dollar deal behind the United States' purchase of Yugoslavia's clandestine space program in the early 1960s. It is based and inspired by numerous real events and facts, in the sense that it is intended as an allegory to the Cold War.",

Slovenia's 2008 submission, Rooster's Breakfast, became the highest-grossing Slovenian film of all time. Before 1993, Slovenia was a republic within Yugoslavia. In 1961, a film shot in Serbo-Croatian and representing Yugoslavia (The Ninth Circle) became the first and only film directed by a Slovenian to be nominated for an Oscar."
