  "/wiki/Multiple_Property_Submission": "The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property.\n The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts.\n For most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, as well as coordinate, identify and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.\n Occasionally, historic sites outside the country proper, but associated with the United States (such as the American Embassy in Tangiers) are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts and multiple property submissions (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties: district, site, structure, building or object. National Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non-contributing properties. Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include National Historic Landmarks (NHL), National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks, National Memorials and some National Monuments. (Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the Antiquities Act because of either their historical or natural significance. They are managed by multiple agencies. Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register.)",

  "/wiki/Fernandina_Beach_Historic_District": "The Fernandina Beach Historic District is a U.S. historic district  located in Fernandina Beach, Florida on Amelia Island. The Fernandina Beach Historic District was included on the National Register on July 20, 1973 and encompasses approximately 1,500 acres (610 ha), bounded by North 9th Street, Broome, Ash, South 5th Street, Date, and South 8th Street. On April 20, 1987, the National Register listing was expanded to include an additional 970 acres (3.9 km\u00b2), bounded by Sixth, Broome, North 3rd, & Escambia Streets; Seventh & Date Streets, and Ash.  Approximately 300 buildings are included in this district.\n David Levy Yulee, one of the first United States senators from Florida, established the first cross-state railroad running from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key, which opened on March 1, 1861. When Yulee established the railroad, he platted \"new\" Fernandina, shifting the town of Fernandina to its present location. Prior to this, Fernandina was located further north in what is now known as Old Town, or the Original Town of Fernandina Historic Site, also on the National Register of Historic Places. The railroad development, in addition to the bustling maritime industry along the Amelia River waterfront, caused \"new\" Fernandina to boom. Buildings in the Fernandina Beach Historic District reflect this late 19th and early 20th century development.\n Significant buildings within the Historic District include the Nassau County Courthouse, the Post Office, the Train Depot, Public School No. 1, St. Peter's Episcopal Church, the First Presbyterian Church, St. Michael's Catholic Church and Academy, the Waas House, the Fairbanks House, the Tabby House, and the Bailey House. Residential architecture is most commonly frame vernacular style, often with Queen Anne influences. Robert Schulyer, a well-known architect in northeast Florida, designed St. Peter's and Public School No. 1.  The Post Office is credited to James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the United States Department of Treasury from 1897 to 1912.\n The City of Fernandina Beach recognized the importance of the Historic District in telling the story of Fernandina's heritage, and in 1975 passed a historic preservation ordinance protecting this district by establishing local boundaries. The ordinance also created design guidelines for rehabilitation and construction projects on the historic buildings, and in addition created the City's Historic District Council, who reviews the projects.  In 1985 and again in 2007, the City had the Historic District professionally surveyed to inventory the historic buildings.  The ordinance and City land development regulations have been updated periodically to reflect contemporary historic preservation practices and to include updated information based on the surveys. The John Denham Palmer House, Amelia Island Lighthouse, and Peck High School have also all been individually included in the local historic district boundaries.\n The Historic District is home to shops, restaurants, bed and breakfasts, and residences.  The Amelia Island Museum of History is directly adjacent to the District, and Fort Clinch and the beach are within a short distance east.  Each year in May, the Isle of Eight Flags Shrimp Festival takes place in the Historic District, attracting thousands of visitors.",

  "/wiki/Florida_State_Road_A1A": "State Road A1A (SR A1A) is a north\u2013south Florida State Road that runs along the Atlantic Ocean, from Key West at the southern tip of Florida, to Fernandina Beach, just south of Georgia on Amelia Island. It is the main road through most oceanfront towns. Part of SR A1A is designated the A1A Scenic and Historic Coastal Byway, a National Scenic Byway. A portion of A1A that passes through Volusia County is designated the Ormond Scenic Loop and Trail, a Florida Scenic Highway. It is also called the Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway from State Road 510 at Wabasso Beach to U.S. Route 1 in Cocoa. A1A is famous worldwide as a center of beach culture in the United States, a scenic coastal route through most Atlantic coastal cities and beach towns, including the unique tropical coral islands of the Florida Keys. A1A also serves as a major thoroughfare through Miami Beach and other south Florida coastal cities.\n Other than SR A1A Alternate (now SR 811, CR 707, SR 732, and an extension of SR 842), only two other Florida state roads have begun with a letter: SR A19A (now a loop of SR 693\u2013SR 699\u2013SR 682 near St. Petersburg), and SR G1A (now SR 300).\n The road was designated as State Road 1 in the 1945 renumbering, mostly replacing the former State Road 140 designation. The number reflected its location in the new grid as the easternmost major north\u2013south road. About a year and a half later, in November 1946, the State Road Board resolved to renumber the route due to confusion with the parallel U.S. Highway 1. The new designation, A1A, was chosen to keep the number 1 in its place in the grid.\n The East Coast Greenway, a system of trails that connects Maine to Florida, travels along sections of State Road A1A.",

  "/wiki/Original_Town_of_Fernandina_Historic_Site": "The Original Town of Fernandina Historic Site, also known as \"Old Town\", is a historic site in Fernandina Beach, Florida, located on Amelia Island. It is roughly bounded by Towngate Street, Bosque Bello Cemetery, Nassau, Marine, and Ladies Streets. On January 29, 1990, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a historic site. Lying north of the Fernandina Beach Historic District, it is accessible from North 14th Street.\n Prior to the arrival of Europeans on what is now Amelia Island, the Old Town site was home to Native Americans. The French, English, and Spanish all maintained a presence on Amelia Island at various times during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, but the Spanish established Fernandina. Old Town, the original location of the town of Fernandina, has the distinction of being the last Spanish city platted in the Western Hemisphere, in 1811. The plat is based on the 1573 Law of the Indies, a document utilized by the Spanish to organize new towns established during their explorations.\n The area within Old Town known as Plaza San Carlos was the plaza ground in front of the Spanish Fort San Carlos, which is no longer in existence.  Today the Plaza San Carlos is maintained by the State of Florida as part of the State Park System.  The plaza offers a space for nature study and picnicking.\n David Levy Yulee, one of the first United States senators from Florida, established the first cross-state railroad running from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key, which opened on March 1, 1861. When Yulee established the railroad, he platted \"new\" Fernandina, shifting the town of Fernandina from Old Town to the present location along Centre Street. As a result of this shift, Old Town has become primarily a residential neighborhood.\n The field work and scholarship of archeologists and historians in the last forty years has advanced understanding of the area's Native American history after European contact. The human occupation of present-day Old Town began around three thousand years ago, and some of the most colorful episodes of Florida history occurred here. Local government has come to realize the singular place Old Town has in telling the story of Fernandina's heritage, and in 1989 the city of Fernandina Beach passed a historic preservation ordinance to protect the district by establishing local boundaries. Old Town has design guidelines for rehabilitation and construction projects, reviewed by the city's Historic District Council. The Old Town preservation and development guidelines focus on lot orientation, an integral part of the process of preserving the 1811 Spanish plan; building aesthetics are also taken into account. The Old Town Historic District was last surveyed as part of the city's 1985 Historic Resources survey.\n Old Town celebrated the 200th anniversary of its founding on April 2, 2011.",
