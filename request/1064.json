  "/wiki/Drumlin": "A drumlin, from the Irish word droimn\u00edn (littlest ridge), first recorded in 1833, in the classical sense is an elongated hill in the shape of an inverted spoon or half-buried egg formed by glacial ice acting on underlying unconsolidated till or ground moraine. Clusters of drumlins create a landscape which is often described as having a 'basket of eggs topography'.",
  "/wiki/Chippewa_Moraine_State_Recreation_Area": "Chippewa Moraine State Recreation Area is a state park unit of Wisconsin, USA, preserving numerous glacial landforms. The abundance and quality of these geological features led to its being included in the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve.  The Ice Age National Scenic Trail passes through the park.  The park is largely undeveloped, but its modern visitor center serves to interpret the area's geological and biological features.  Official documentation alternatively refers to the park as the Chippewa Moraine Ice Age Reserve or the Chippewa Moraine Ice Age National Scientific Reserve. It is located in northwestern Chippewa County.\n The Chippewa Moraine Interpretive Center offers exhibits about the area's geology, natural history, and cultural history, as well as naturalist-led programs for school groups.

  "/wiki/Kettle_(geology)": "A kettle (kettle hole, pothole) is a depression/hole in an outwash plain formed by retreating glaciers or draining floodwaters. The kettles are formed as a result of blocks of dead ice left behind by retreating glaciers, which become surrounded by sediment deposited by meltwater streams as there is increased friction. The ice becomes buried in the sediment and when the ice melts, a depression is left called a kettle hole, creating a dimpled appearance on the outwash plain. Lakes often fill these kettles; these are called kettle hole lakes. Another source is the sudden drainage of an ice-dammed lake. When the block melts, the hole it leaves behind is a kettle. As the ice melts, ramparts can form around the edge of the kettle hole. The lakes that fill these holes are seldom more than 10 m (33 ft) deep and eventually become filled with sediment.",

  "/wiki/Driftless_Zone": "The Driftless Area is a region in southwestern Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota, northeastern Iowa, and the extreme northwestern corner of Illinois, of the American Midwest. The region escaped the flattening effects of glaciation during the last ice age and is consequently characterized by steep, forested ridges, deeply carved river valleys, and karst geology characterized by spring-fed waterfalls and cold-water trout streams. Ecologically, the Driftless Area's flora and fauna are more closely related to those of the Great Lakes region and New England than those of the broader Midwest and central Plains regions. Colloquially, the term includes the incised Paleozoic Plateau of southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa. The region includes elevations ranging from 603 to 1,719 feet (184 to 524 m) at Blue Mound State Park and covers 24,000 square miles (62,200 km2). The rugged terrain is due both to the lack of glacial deposits, or drift, and to the incision of the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries into bedrock.\n An alternative, less restrictive definition of the Driftless Area includes the sand Plains region northeast of Wisconsin's portion of the incised Paleozoic Plateau in the southwestern part of the state. This part of the Driftless Area in the southwestern section of Wisconsin's Central Plain also lacks evidence of glaciation (although it was modified by glacial meltwaters that collected in Glacial Lake Wisconsin), and contains many isolated hills, bluffs, mesas, buttes, and pinnacles that are outlying eroded Cambrian bedrock remnants of the plateau to the southwest.",
  "/wiki/Canyon": "A canyon (Spanish: ca\u00f1\u00f3n; archaic British English spelling: ca\u00f1on) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces, eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream. A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation, which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains. The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks, such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, the Himalayas or the Andes. Usually a river or stream carve out such splits between mountains. Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California's Sierra Nevada. Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side, are called box canyons.",

  "/wiki/Moraine": "A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (regolith and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier, and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines (till-covered areas with irregular topography) and medial moraines (moraines formed where two glaciers meet).",

It has also been referred to as the Kettle Range and, in geological texts, as the Kettle Interlobate Moraine.\n The moraine was created when the Green Bay Lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, on the west, collided with the Lake Michigan Lobe of that glacier, on the east, depositing sediment. The western lobe formed Green Bay, Lake Winnebago and the Horicon Marsh. The major part of the Kettle Moraine area is considered interlobate moraine, though other types of moraine features, and other glacial features are common.",
  "/wiki/Kame": "A kame is a glacial landform, an irregularly shaped hill or mound composed of sand, gravel and till that accumulates in a depression on a retreating glacier, and is then deposited on the land surface with further melting of the glacier. Kames are often associated with kettles, and this is referred to as kame and kettle topography. The word kame is a variant of comb (kame, or kaim is the Old Scottish word for comb), which has the meaning crest among others. The geological term was introduced by Thomas Jamieson in 1874. According to White, kames were formed by meltwater which deposited more or less washed material at irregular places in and along melting ice. At places the material is very well washed and stratified; at others it is more poorly washed, with inclusions of till masses that fell from ice but were covered before they were completely washed. Kame gravels thus tend to be variable and range from fine to coarse grained and even to cobbly and boulder. With the melting of the glacier, streams carry sediment to glacial lakes, building kame deltas on top of the ice.",

The scientific reserve was established in 1971 and today encompasses some 32,500 acres (13,200 ha). The landforms are the result of the Wisconsin glaciation during the last glacial period, which lasted from about 110,000 to 10,000 years ago. The nine units of the reserve, mostly Wisconsin state parks or other protected areas, are administered by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Several units are not yet developed for visitation, having only minimal trails and no interpretive installations. Planning was underway as of 2012[update] for the future development and management of the Cross Plains unit. Several of the sites are joined by the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, but the reserve is a separate entity."
