The Port of Greater Baton Rouge is the 10th-largest in the United States in terms of tonnage shipped, and is the farthest upstream Mississippi River port capable of handling Panamax ships. This, as well as its status as a major port city, is largely due to the Huey P. Long - O.K.

  "/wiki/Friction,_Baby": "Friction, Baby is Better Than Ezra's third album. It was released on August 13, 1996. After this album was released, they took the year off in 1997 after touring. The album's title comes from a television interview with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. When asked how he and Mick Jagger stayed together for so long, Keith took a long drag from his cigarette and said friction, baby. This may also be a reference to the fact that the band had replaced its original drummer, Cary Bonnecaze, between the recording of their previous album and this one. The album produced two hits on the Billboard modern rock charts: King of New Orleans and Desperately Wanting. Desperately Wanting also narrowly missed the Billboard Top 40, peaking at #48.

It was the band's fourth album, and their second with drummer Travis Aaron McNabb. It was released on August 25, 1998 by Elektra Records. The style and content of the album overall is oriented with the night, with the album cover carrying the subtitle A Series of Nocturnes. Though critically acclaimed, the album was a relative failure commercially, only peaking at #128 on the Billboard charts. The first single, One More Murder scraped the bottom end of the Billboard Modern Rock charts, while the second single, At the Stars, performed better, becoming a Modern Rock and Adult Top 40 hit (and later covered by Howie Day). A third single, Like it Like That, failed to chart. One More Murder was featured on two NBC dramatic series - Homicide: Life on the Street and Third Watch. The song was also featured in an episode of Charmed and is also part of The X-Files: The Album. The album's title is most likely derived from the nursery rhyme, Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary. Je ne m'en souviens pas, the album's opening track, shares its title with a work by the Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dal\u00ed, with lyrical reference to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa as well as New Orleans' Cabrini High School.",

The first single off the album, Extra Ordinary, placed on both the Billboard Modern Rock and Adult Top 40 charts (it was the eighth and last BTE single to date to place on the Modern Rock charts). A second single, Misunderstood, was planned, but Beyond Records declared bankruptcy before it could be released. As of early 2007, Closer was out of print due to Beyond Records going out of business and copies were scarce, though some were still in stock in stores. Legal problems resulting from Beyond's bankruptcy meant it would be four years before Better than Ezra's next studio album, Before the Robots. In the meantime, the band would release a live album in 2004, recorded in their hometown at the House of Blues. In June 2009, the band announced they had acquired the rights to Closer and all of the master tracks recorded during the sessions for the album, and would be reissuing it via their own label on CD, The re-release was made available in October 2009 via the band's online store, sporting a bright new red cover, and two bonus tracks, Simple Song, a long-standing fan favorite, and Screwed Up And Beautiful.

Prior to the album's release, the band offered to autograph all copies of the album pre-ordered through their website. The album title reportedly came to the band's drummer Travis McNabb in a dream. He dreamt of seeing a UK buzz band called Before the Robots. The next day, he asked fellow band members if there was such a band. Upon finding out there was not, they decided to adopt the phrase for this album's title. On January 22, 2010, American country-pop singer Taylor Swift covered Breathless at a performance at the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief event, a charity telethon to benefit the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton and lumber. Home to Tennessee's largest African-American population, Memphis played a prominent role in the American civil rights movement and was the site of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1968 assassination.",

Under British rule, a settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British. A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States. Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port.
