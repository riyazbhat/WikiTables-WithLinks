The men's races were at Bjela\u0161nica and the women's at Jahorina. Due to weather delays (a blizzard), both downhill races were postponed several days and run after the giant slalom races. This was the first Winter Olympics since 1936 which did not also serve as the world championships for alpine skiing. It was the last Olympic program with just six events for alpine skiing; ten events were held in 1988 with the return of the combined event and the addition of Super G.\n Banned from competition at these Olympics by the International Ski Federation (FIS) were top World Cup racers Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden and Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein, both double gold medalists at the 1980 Winter Olympics and leading the World Cup in 1984. They had accepted promotional payments directly, rather than through their national ski federations. Also absent was Marc Girardelli, who had not yet gained his citizenship from Luxembourg and was not allowed to compete for his native Austria.",

The reigning world champion was Harti Weirather of Austria, while teammate Franz Klammer was the reigning World Cup downhill champion and Switzerland's Urs R\u00e4ber led the current season. Similar to 1980, the defending Olympic downhill champion was from Austria and did not compete; Leonhard Stock was injured a month earlier in early January. In order to meet the minimum vertical drop requirement of 800 meters (2,625 feet), the starting gate was in a newly-constructed summit lodge and restaurant, with a connecting ramp to the mountain proper. Bill Johnson of the United States became the first from outside the Alps to win an Olympic downhill. In his first full World Cup season, he was a top glider and made up time on the flatter lower third of the course. The previous best finishes for an American man in an Olympic downhill was fifth (1952, 1980), and sixth (1976); American women had won three medals (1960, 1972, 1976), but never a gold. The course started at an elevation of 2,076 m (6,811 ft) above sea level with a vertical drop of 803 m (2,635 ft) and a length of 3.066 km (1.91 mi). Johnson's winning time was 105.59 seconds, yielding an average speed of 104.533 km/h (65.0 mph), with an average vertical descent rate of 7.605 m/s (25.0 ft/s).",
