The National Football League (NFL)'s defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33\u201314. This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium. Coming into this game, like during the first Super Bowl, many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL. The Packers, the defending champions, posted a 9\u20134\u20131 record during the 1967 NFL season before defeating the Dallas Cowboys, 21\u201317, in the 1967 NFL Championship Game (also popularly known as the Ice Bowl). The Raiders finished the 1967 AFL season at 13\u20131, and defeated the Houston Oilers, 40\u20137, in the 1967 AFL Championship Game.

This was the first Super Bowl victory for the AFL. Before the game, most sports writers and fans believed that AFL teams were less talented than NFL clubs, and expected the Colts to defeat the Jets by a wide margin. Baltimore posted a 13\u20131 record in the  regular season and shut out the Cleveland Browns 34\u20130 in the NFL Championship Game.

The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter, known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street. The city has been described as the most unique in the United States, owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage. Founded in 1718 by French colonists, New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35\u201310. Coming into this game, considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL, thus the teams representing the two rival leagues (Kansas City and Green Bay, respectively) felt pressure to win. The Chiefs posted an 11\u20132\u20131 record during the 1966 AFL season, and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31\u20137, in the AFL Championship Game. The Packers finished the 1966 NFL season at 12\u20132, and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34\u201327 in the NFL Championship Game. Still, many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL, and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City. The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive, as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards, 181\u2013164, to come within 14\u201310 at halftime.
