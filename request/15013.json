The school is a member of the Pac-12 Conference. Washington students, sports teams, and alumni are called Huskies. The husky was selected as the school mascot by student committee in 1923. It replaced the Sun Dodger, an abstract reference to the local weather that was quickly dropped in favor of something more tangible. The costumed Harry the Husky performs at sporting and special events, and a live Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs II, has traditionally led the football team onto the field at the start of games. The school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote. The choice was purportedly inspired by the first stanza of Lord Byron's The Destruction of Sennacherib\n Among its facilities on campus are Husky Stadium (football), Hec Edmundson Pavilion (basketball, gymnastics and volleyball), Husky Ballpark (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium (softball), the Nordstrom Tennis Center, the Dempsey Indoor practice facility, and the Conibear Shellhouse (rowing).",
