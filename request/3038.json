  "/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_Philippines": "There are many and diverse political parties in the Philippines. Most party membership consists primarily of political figures and leaders, with little or no grassroots membership. [citation needed]\n The Philippines has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments for political expediency and convenience. Since no political parties have sustaining membership to which party leaders are developed, most of the political parties have the rise-and-fall-and-rise character. There are three types of parties in the Philippines. These are: (a) major parties, which typically correspond to traditional political parties; (b) minor parties or party-list organizations, which rely on the party-list system to win Congressional seats; and (c) regional or provincial parties, which correspond to region-wide or province-wide organizations, respectively.",
