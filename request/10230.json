Kennedy Space Center (KSC, originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center),  located in Merritt Island, Florida, is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers.

The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and even own facilities on each other's property. Though the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from CCAFS, the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization, the Launch Operations Directorate. Starting with the fourth Gemini mission, the NASA launch control center in Florida (Mercury Control Center, later the Launch Control Center) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston, shortly after liftoff; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.

  "/wiki/List_of_United_States_Air_Force_Academy_alumni": "The United States Air Force Academy is an undergraduate college in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with the mission of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Air Force. The Academy was established in 1954, entered its first class in 1955, and graduated its first class in 1959. All students hold the Air Force rank of \"Cadet.\" Sports media refer to the Academy as \"Air Force\"; this usage is officially endorsed. Most cadets are admitted through a congressional appointment system. The curriculum is broad-based but has traditionally emphasized science and engineering. Before the Academy's first graduating class in 1959, the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy were the primary sources of officers for the Air Force and its predecessors, the Army Air Corps and Army Air Forces. [citation needed] Though the primary focus of the Academy is for the Air Force, some graduates are given the option of \"cross-commissioning\" into the United States Army, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard."
