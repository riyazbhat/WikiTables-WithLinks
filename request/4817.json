  "/wiki/The_Ashes": "The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and  Australia. The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, its first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882\u201383 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to regain those ashes. The English media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the Ashes. After England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women including Florence Morphy, whom Bligh married within a year.",

  "/wiki/History_of_Test_cricket_from_1877_to_1883": "Test matches in the period 1877 to 1883 were organised somewhat differently from international cricket matches today. All were between Australian and English sides, the teams were rarely representative, and the lengthy boat trip required was one that many cricketers (especially amateurs) were unable or unwilling to undertake. As such, the home teams enjoyed a great advantage. Thirteen Test Matches were played during the period between Australian and English sides. Most were not styled as representative England v. Australia contests, however: this description was only applied later by cricket statisticians. The same is true of their designation as Test matches, which did not enter into the vernacular until 1885. [citation needed]  Eleven of the thirteen matches played to 1883 were in Australia, where the colonials made the most of their home advantage, winning seven while England won four, and two matches were drawn. By 1883, the tradition of England-Australia tours was well established, that year having concluded the first Ashes series.",
