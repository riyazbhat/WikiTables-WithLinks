Brazilian athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games since 1920, except the 1928 Summer Olympics. The country is represented by the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB \u2013 Comit\u00ea Ol\u00edmpico Brasileiro). Brazil headed to the Beijing Games with its largest Olympic delegation ever, 277 athletes, including a record 132 women. The 17 medals won by Brazil topped the previous medal count record set in 1996, and included the first individual and gold medals by women, by judoka Ketleyn Quadros and jumper Maurren Maggi, respectively. Three of the medals were gold, by Maggi, swimmer C\u00e9sar Cielo and the female volleyball team.\n Brazil was the 39th nation to enter the Beijing National Stadium during the Olympic opening ceremony . Sailor Robert Scheidt (1996, 2000 and 2004 medalist) was the flag bearer at the opening ceremony.  In the ceremony, it was present Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil. Lula and Carlos Arthur Nuzman, president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, lobbied for Rio de Janeiro's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n The swimmer C\u00e9sar Cielo was the first Brazilian swimmer to be gold medalist, when he conquered the gold medal in men's 50 m freestyle, with an Olympic record. Raised to the post of new hero of the national sport, he had previously won in Beijing the bronze medal in the 50 m freestyle a result that confirmed his position of new standout in the tests of speed of swimming.\n The jumper Maurren Maggi reached 7.04m in the final of the women's long jump and surpassed, in just one centimeter, the Russian Tatyana Lebedeva. Maurren won gold and became the first Brazilian woman in history to win the gold medal, not only in Athletics but also in an individual event of any sport in the Olympic Games. Maurren Maggi, was the flag bearer at the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.\n It was also in 2008 Summer Olympics that one of the most popular sports in Brazil finally saw women win Olympic gold: the volleyball. Four years earlier, in Athens, the Brazil women's national volleyball team, led by coach Jos\u00e9 Roberto Guimar\u00e3es, champion with the men's team at the 1992 Barcelona Games, had been very close to the dreamy Olympic decision when, in the semifinal against Russia, got the advantage of 24/19 in the fourth set (the Brazilians led by 2 sets to 1). Incredibly, although it needed just one more point to close the match, the Brazilians allowed a spectacular turn of the Russians in the fourth set. Not only did they lose that quarter-final by 28/26, like the game after a 16/14 loss in the tie-break. They would also lose the bronze medal for the Cuba. The trauma of Athens, however, was completely erased in Beijing. With a perfect campaign of eight wins, highlighted by the statistics of only one set lost in all the tournament, Brazil was the champion by defeating the United States in the decision by 3 to 1. Jos\u00e9 Roberto Guimar\u00e3es entered history as the only coach to have taken a male and a female teams Olympic gold.\n The Brazil men's national volleyball team was silver medalist of the tournament, losing the gold medal match by 3 to 1 to United States. In the beach volleyball two medals were conquered in the men's tournament. M\u00e1rcio Ara\u00fajo and F\u00e1bio Luiz Magalh\u00e3es were silver medalists, losing the gold medal match to Americans Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser. The bronze medal was obtained by Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego.\n At the football the Brazil women's national football team won the silver medal. The team advanced to the final against United States and lost by 1-0 at extra time. The Brazil national under-23 football team was the bronze medalist in the men's tournament.\n The sailors Robert Scheidt and Bruno Prada were silver medalists in Star class. This was Robert Scheidt's fourth of his 5 Olympic medals. Also in the sailing, Fernanda Oliveira and Isabel Swan were the bronze medalists in Women's 470 class, becoming the first Brazilian women to win an Olympic medal in sailing.\n Brazilian judokas won three more podiums for Brazil. Leandro Guilheiro was the bronze medalist in men's 73 kg while Thiago Camilo won the bronze in men's 81 kg category. Ketleyn Quadros was the bronze medalist in women's 57 kg. She was the first Brazilian judoka woman to win an Olympic medal and also the first Brazilian woman to conquer a medal in an individual sport.\n The taekwondo athlete Nat\u00e1lia Falavigna won the bronze medal in women's +67 kg category. This was the first Olympic medal ever won by Brazil in the Taekwondo.\n Finally two more bronze medals were awarded to Brazilian athletes, several years after the 2008 Summer Olympics, due to doping violations. Both medals were in the athletics. Originally won by Russia, the gold medal of women's 4 \u00d7 100 m relay was stripped due to anti-doping rules violation by Yulia Chermoshanskaya. Following medals reallocation, Belgium was awarded gold, Nigeria \u2013 silver and Brazil \u2013 bronze.

It is taken by mouth or held in the cheek or under the tongue.\nSide effects of methyltestosterone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It can also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement in men and liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has moderate androgenic effects and moderate anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculinization.\n Methyltestosterone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in 1936. It was made shortly after the discovery of testosterone and was one of the first synthetic AAS to be developed. In addition to its medical use, methyltestosterone is used to improve physique and performance, although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for such purposes due to its androgenic effects, estrogenic effects, and risk of liver damage.

  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid. In male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is involved in health and well-being, and the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.\n Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.  It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. In humans and most other vertebrates, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. On average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females. As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. Females are also more sensitive to the hormone.\n In addition to its role as a natural hormone, testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men, transgender hormone therapy for transgender men, and breast cancer in women. Since testosterone levels decrease as men age, testosterone is sometimes used in older men to counteract this deficiency. It is also used illicitly to enhance physique and performance, for instance in athletes.",

  "/wiki/Nonivamide": "Nonivamide, also called pelargonic acid vanillylamide or PAVA, is an organic compound and a capsaicinoid. It is an amide of pelargonic acid (n-nonanoic acid) and vanillyl amine.  It is present in chili peppers, but is commonly manufactured synthetically. It is more heat-stable than capsaicin. \n Nonivamide is used as a food additive to add pungency to seasonings, flavorings, and spice blends. It is also used in the confectionery industry to create a hot sensation, and in the pharmaceutical industry in some formulations as a cheaper alternative to capsaicin. \n Like capsaicin, it can deter mammals (but not birds or insects) from consuming plants or seeds (e.g. squirrels and bird feeder seeds). This is consistent with nonivamide's role as a TRPV1 ion channel agonist. Mammalian TRPV1 is activated by heat and capsaicin, but the avian form is insensitive to capsaicin.  \n Nonivamide is used (under the name PAVA) as the payload in \"less-lethal munitions\" such as the Fabrique Nationale Herstal FN 303 or as the active ingredient in most pepper sprays \u2013 in both applications, the idea is to temporarily incapacitate people so that they can either be detained prior to arrest or deterred from acts of violence toward law-enforcement personnel or third parties (such as rioting or other group violence).",

Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias, cachexia (wasting syndrome), osteoporosis, breast cancer, and for other indications. They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat.\nSide effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children. They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body.\n Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s. They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide. In addition to their medical use, nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance, and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes.

When taken by mouth, it typically begins working within an hour, while intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes.\n Common side effects include feeling lightheaded with standing, ringing in the ears, and sensitivity to light. Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss. Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment. Furosemide is a type of loop diuretic that works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys.\n Furosemide was patented in 1959 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale price in the developing world is between US$0.004 and US$0.02 per day. In the United States, it is available as a generic medication and costs about US$0.15 per day. In 2016, it was the 15th most prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 32 million prescriptions.

  "/wiki/Continuous_erythropoietin_receptor_activator": "Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) is the generic term for drugs in a new class of third-generation erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). In the media, these agents are commonly referred to as 'EPO', short for erythropoietin. CERAs have an extended half-life and a mechanism of action that promotes increased stimulation of erythropoietin receptors compared with other ESAs.\n Under the trade name Mircera, Roche Pharmaceuticals received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2008 to market a continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, including in those undergoing dialysis. .[citation needed]  This issue appears to have been resolved since Fresenius Medical dialysis clinics in the US are now administering this drug.[citation needed]) Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta had been approved by the European Commission in August 2007, and was made available in Europe at the start of 2008.\n In terms of its structure, Mircera is similar to the previous synthetic EPO drugs, except that it is connected to a chemical called polyethylene glycol (PEG), which makes it last longer in the body. According to Roche, the product has the longest half-life of all FDA-approved erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): up to 6 times longer than darbepoetin alfa and up to 20 times longer than epoetin. CERAs thus promise both lower dosing\u2014significant owing to the high inherent cost of manufacturing recombinant protein drugs\u2014and less frequent injections for patients. ESAs are administered via subcutaneous injections, often in doctor's offices for patients who lack the skill or dexterity to inject themselves, so the once- or twice-monthly dosing regimen for CERAs promises fewer costly, inconvenient office visits for patients requiring constant hemoglobin level maintenance for chronic kidney disease.\n In clinical trials, CERA dosed every 3 to 4 weeks demonstrated efficacy similar to that of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin concentrations within the target hemoglobin range. CERA has generally been well tolerated in clinical trials.[citation needed]",
