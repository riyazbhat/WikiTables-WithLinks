Its capital, Luxembourg City, is one of the four official capitals of the European Union (together with Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg) and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial authority in the EU. Its culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours, making it essentially a mixture of French and German cultures, as evident by the nation's three official languages: French, German, and the national language of Luxembourgish. The repeated invasions by Germany, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and, among other things, led to the foundation of the European Union.",

  "/wiki/Maltese_language": "Maltese (Maltese: Malti) is a Semitic language spoken by the Maltese people of Malta. It is a standardised and Latinised variety of Arabic. It is the national language of the country and also serves as an official language of the European Union, the only Semitic language so distinguished. Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect during the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091. As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-christianisation of the island, Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of Latinisation. It is therefore exceptional as a variety of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic. \nMaltese morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian.",
