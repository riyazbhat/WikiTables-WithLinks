  "/wiki/99942_Apophis": "99942 Apophis (/\u0259\u02c8p\u0252f\u026as/, previously known by its provisional designation 2004 MN4) is a  near-Earth asteroid with a diameter of 370 metres that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 because initial observations indicated a probability of up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on April\u00a013, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth or the Moon in 2029. However, until 2006, a possibility remained that during the 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole, a small region no more than about 800 metres (1\u20442\u00a0mi) in diameter, that would set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April\u00a013, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level\u00a01 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis's rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1\u00a0km wide. During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating on the Torino scale, reaching level\u00a04 on December 27, 2004.",
