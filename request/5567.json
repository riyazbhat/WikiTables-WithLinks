  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere.\n In more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius r.",
  "/wiki/99942_Apophis": "99942 Apophis (/\u0259\u02c8p\u0252f\u026as/, previously known by its provisional designation 2004 MN4) is a  near-Earth asteroid with a diameter of 370 metres that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 because initial observations indicated a probability of up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on April\u00a013, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth or the Moon in 2029. However, until 2006, a possibility remained that during the 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole, a small region no more than about 800 metres (1\u20442\u00a0mi) in diameter, that would set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April\u00a013, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level\u00a01 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis's rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1\u00a0km wide. During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating on the Torino scale, reaching level\u00a04 on December 27, 2004.\n As of 2014, the diameter of Apophis is estimated to be approximately 370 metres (1,210\u00a0ft). Preliminary observations by Goldstone radar in January 2013 effectively ruled out the possibility of an Earth impact by Apophis in 2036. By May 6, 2013 (April 15, 2013 observation arc), the probability of an impact on April 13, 2036 had been eliminated. Using observations through February 26, 2014, the odds of an impact on April 12, 2068, as calculated by the JPL Sentry risk table are 1 in 150,000. As of October\u00a02019[update], there were two asteroids with a more notable cumulative Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale than Apophis, though none of them have a Torino level greater than 0. On average, one asteroid the size of Apophis (370 metres) can be expected to impact Earth once in about 80,000 years.",

  "/wiki/Trojan_asteroids": "In astronomy, a trojan is a small celestial body that shares the orbit of a larger one, remaining in a stable orbit approximately 60\u00b0 ahead or behind the main body near one of its Lagrangian points L4 and L5. Trojans can share the orbits of planets or of large moons.\n Trojans are one type of co-orbital object. In this arrangement, a star and a planet orbit about their common barycenter, which is close to the center of the star because it is usually much more massive than the orbiting planet. In turn, a much smaller mass than both the star and the planet, located at one of the Lagrangian points of the star\u2013planet system, is subject to a combined gravitational force that acts through this barycenter. Hence the smallest object orbits around the barycenter with the same orbital period as the planet, and the arrangement can remain stable over time.\n In the Solar System, most known trojans share the orbit of Jupiter. They are divided into the Greek camp at L4 (ahead of Jupiter) and the Trojan camp at L5 (trailing Jupiter). More than a million Jupiter trojans larger than one kilometer are thought to exist, of which more than 7,000 are currently catalogued. Only nine Mars trojans, 22 Neptune trojans, two Uranus trojans, and a single Earth trojan, have been found to date. A temporary Venus Trojan is also known.  Numerical orbital dynamics stability simulations indicate that Saturn and Uranus probably do not have any primordial trojans.\n The same arrangement can appear when the primary object is a planet and the secondary is one of its moons, whereby much smaller trojan moons can share its orbit. All known trojan moons are part of the Saturn system. Telesto and Calypso are trojans of Tethys, and Helene and Polydeuces of Dione.",

  "/wiki/Solar_sail": "Solar sails (also called light sails or photon sails) are a method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight on large mirrors. Based on the physics, a number of spaceflight missions to test solar propulsion and navigation have been proposed since the 1980s.\n A useful analogy to solar sailing may be a sailing boat; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the wind. High-energy laser beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing. Solar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes. Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads.\n Solar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven, measured effect on aerodynamics. Solar pressure affects all spacecraft, whether in interplanetary space or in orbit around a planet or small body. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, will be displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure, so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory planning, which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the orientation of a spacecraft, a factor that must be included in spacecraft design.\n The total force exerted on an 800 by 800 meter solar sail, for example, is about 5 newtons (1.1\u00a0lbf) at Earth's distance from the Sun, making it a low-thrust propulsion system, similar to spacecraft propelled by electric engines, but as it uses no propellant, that force is exerted almost constantly and the collective effect over time is great enough to be considered a potential manner of propelling spacecraft.",

It is 512 kilometers (318\u00a0mi) in diameter, somewhat smaller than 4 Vesta. It is likely a remnant protoplanet.\n When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers on 28 March 1802, it was counted as a planet, as were other asteroids in the early 19th century. The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to their reclassification.\n Pallas's surface is most likely composed of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8\u00b0, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.\n It was considered as a potential planet in 2006, but it has since been determined that its shape departs significantly from an ellipsoid.",
