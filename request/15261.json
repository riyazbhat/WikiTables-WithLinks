  "/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Somerset": "The ceremonial county of Somerset, England is divided into 418 areas known as civil parishes, which are lowest unit of local government in England. Parishes arose from Church of England divisions, and were given their current powers and responsibilities by the Local Government Act 1894. The Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas. Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs were replaced by new successor parishes; urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes became unparished areas.\n The county of Somerset consists of a non-metropolitan county administered by Somerset County Council, divided into five districts and two unitary authorities. The districts of Somerset are West Somerset, South Somerset, Taunton Deane, Mendip and Sedgemoor. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on 1 April 1996 following the break-up of the county of Avon, are North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset. These unitary authorities include areas that were part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.\n The city of Bath is the largest centre of population in Bath and North East Somerset. Areas of the city that were formerly within the Bath County Borough are now unparished, but the rest of the authority is divided into 49\u00a0parishes. All of North Somerset, the other unitary authority, is covered by its 39\u00a0parishes ranging from the village Loxton with a population of 192,  to the town of Weston-super-Mare with 76,143\u00a0inhabitants.\n South Somerset is the largest of Somerset's five districts, covering an area of 958\u00a0square kilometres (370\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) from the borders with Devon and Dorset to the edge of the Somerset Levels. It has a population of about 156,100. The largest settlement in the district is Yeovil, with a population of 30,378. Part of Taunton formerly within Taunton Municipal Borough is unparished, but the rest of Taunton Deane is divided into 49\u00a0parishes. Tolland has just 81\u00a0residents, compared to the town of Wellington which has 12,979. West Somerset is a largely rural area, with a population of 35,712 in an area of 740\u00a0square kilometres (290\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). According to figures released by the Office for National Statistics in 2009, the population of West Somerset has the highest average age of any district in the United Kingdom at 52, living in 43\u00a0parishes with 11,981 living in its most populous town, Minehead.
