  "/wiki/List_of_longest_suspension_bridge_spans": "The world's longest suspension bridges are listed according to the length of their main span (i.e. the length of suspended roadway between the bridge's towers).

If one bridge has a longer span than another it does not necessarily mean that the bridge is longer from shore to shore (or from abutment to abutment)."
