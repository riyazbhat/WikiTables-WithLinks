It stretches from the village of Hareid in the west to the villages of Tafjord and Geiranger in the east. The Storfjorden system branches off into several smaller fjords including the famous Geirangerfjord and Tafjorden. At the village of Stranda, the main fjord branches off into the Sunnylvsfjorden-Geirangerfjorden to the west and the Norddalsfjorden-Tafjorden to the east. The name literally means the big or great fjord, indicating that this is a long fjord and it is, in fact, the main fjord in this region. Stretching about 110 kilometres (68 mi), Storfjord is the 5th longest fjord in Norway. The Storfjord is a dominant topographical feature in the Sunnm\u00f8re region as it cuts the region in two parts that are only connected by ferry. The deepest point in the fjord is 679 metres (2,228 ft) near the village of Dyrkorn in Stordal Municipality. The landscape around Storfjorden is typical for Western Norway. The mouth of the fjord is surrounded by islands with mountains reaching 500 to 800 metres (1,600 to 2,600 ft) above sea level. Further to the east there are higher mountains.

The project was cancelled again on 26 February 2013, by Prime Minister Mario Monti's government due to budget constraints.

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana. Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian Peninsula, from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina. Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna, the tallest active volcano in Europe, and one of the most active in the world, currently 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high. The island has a typical Mediterranean climate. The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC. By around 750 BC, Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantine Empire, and the Emirate of Sicily. The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily, which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen, the Capetian House of Anjou, Spain, and the House of Habsburg. It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand, a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification, and a plebiscite. Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946, 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946.",

He served twice as Prime Minister of Italy, first from 17 May 1996 to 21 October 1998 and then from 17 May 2006 to 8 May 2008. He is considered the founder of the Italian centre-left and one of the most prominent and iconic figures of the so-called Second Republic. Prodi is often nicknamed Il Professore (The Professor) due to his academic career. A former professor of economics and international advisor to Goldman Sachs, Prodi ran in 1996 as lead candidate of The Olive Tree coalition, winning the general election and serving as Prime Minister of Italy until 1998. Following the victory of his coalition The Union over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi in the April 2006 Italian elections, Prodi took power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate house and consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, but he continued in office for almost four months for routine business, until early elections were held and a new government was formed. Until now, he is the first progressive candidate to ever come first at legislative elections since 1921 and to manage to form a government without the need of opponents' parliamentary support. On 14 October 2007, Prodi became the first President of the Democratic Party upon foundation of the party.
