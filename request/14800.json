  "/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes": "The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge (England) and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, Acorn's first general-purpose home computer based on its own ARM architecture. The first Archimedes was launched in 1987.",
  "/wiki/RISC_OS": "RISC OS /r\u026asko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ is a computer operating system originally designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England. First released in 1987, it was designed to run on the ARM chipset, which Acorn had designed concurrently for use in its new line of Archimedes personal computers. RISC OS takes its name from the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture it supports.",
  "/wiki/Freeware": "Freeware is software, most often proprietary, that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user. There is no agreed-upon set of rights, license, or EULA that defines freeware unambiguously; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers. For instance, modification, redistribution by third parties, and reverse engineering without the author's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others. Unlike with free and open-source software, which are also often distributed free of charge, the source code for freeware is typically not made available. Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by, for example, encouraging sales of a more capable version, as in the freemium and shareware business models.",
  "/wiki/Proprietary_software": "Proprietary software, also known as closed-source software, is non-free computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights\u2014usually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights.",
  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as Windows, is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.",
  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing, cross-platform software (also multi-platform software or platform-independent software) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms. Cross-platform software may be divided into two types; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports, and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation, e.g., software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms.",
  "/wiki/GPLv2": "The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman, former head of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms. This is in distinction to permissive software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.",

  "/wiki/Acorn_A7000": "The A7000 and A7000+ were Acorn Computers' entry level computers based on the RiscPC architecture. Launched in 1995, they replaced some of the models of the Acorn Archimedes range. After the breakup of Acorn Computers in 1998, Castle Technology bought the rights to continue production of the A7000+. The A7000 used the ARM7500 system on chip which combined the separate ARM CPU, MMU, VIDC20 video chip and IOMD IO controller of the RiscPC into a single chip.",
  "/wiki/Risc_PC": "The RiscPC (stylised with a half-space[self-published source?] as Risc\u2009PC, also referred to as Risc PC and codenamed Medusa) was Acorn Computers's next generation RISC OS/Acorn RISC Machine computer, launched on 15 April 1994, which superseded the Acorn Archimedes. The Acorn PC card and software allows PC compatible software to be run.",
  "/wiki/Phoebe_(computer)": "The Phoebe 2100 (or Risc PC 2) was to be Acorn Computers' successor to the Risc PC, slated for release in late 1998. However, in September 1998 Acorn cancelled the project as part of a restructuring of the company.",
  "/wiki/VirtualAcorn": "VirtualAcorn is the brand name of several commercial emulators of Acorn Computers computer hardware platforms."
