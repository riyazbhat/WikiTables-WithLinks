Based in Sorgenfri near Copenhagen, Peyk and Kabr\u00e9 had been in the Danish hip hop environment since its birth in the early 1980s. They made several failed attempts at performing Danish language rap starting in 1986, but would not succeed until the inclusion of Enemark in 1987. Enemark was not previously into hip hop, and part of his success was that he did not try to emulate the style of English-language rappers, but had his own unique Danish style instead. The group then signed a record-deal under the name MC Einar, again moving against the general rap scene as the Danish name Einar is a name typically found in elderly generations rather than the young target audience.
