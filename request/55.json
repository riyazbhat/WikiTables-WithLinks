[g] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area[b] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast.",
  "/wiki/Workers'_Solidarity_Alliance": "Workers' Solidarity Alliance (WSA) is an American anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian group designed to help establish member-managed organizations in the workplace and community. It was founded in 1984, created from an existing network of groups including the Libertarian Workers' Group. It is based in New York, and produced a print journal called Ideas & Action from 1984 to 1997. On May 1, 2010, the WSA relaunched the Ideas and Action publication in an electronic magazine format. The Workers' Solidarity Alliance website states that the WSA believes that working people can build a new society and a better world based on the principles of solidarity and self-management, and that such a society will be brought about only by working people building their own self-managed mass organizations from the ground up. WSA argues that the fight against gender inequality, structural racism and the oppression of LGBT people are also part of the larger struggle for social liberation and self-management. WSA believes that both capitalism and state socialism are based on the submission and exploitation of the working class. They argue that for the liberation of the workers, it would be necessary for the working class to take control of the industries in which it works, dismantle corporate hierarchies from top to bottom and create new institutions of popular power, based on the Participatory democracy of workplace and neighborhood assemblies, and dismantle state hierarchies, so that most people take control over public affairs."
