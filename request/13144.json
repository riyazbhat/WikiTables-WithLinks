Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion (about $23 billion in 2018 dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.",

The observatory, sometimes called the birthplace of modern astrophysics, was founded in 1897 by astronomer George Ellery Hale and financed by businessman Charles T. Yerkes. It represented a shift in the thinking about observatories, from their being mere housing for telescopes and observers, to the early-20th-century concept of observation equipment integrated with laboratory space for physics and chemistry. The observatory ceased operations in 2018. The observatory houses a 40-inch (102-cm) diameter doublet lens refracting telescope, the largest ever successfully used for astronomy, and a collection of over 170,000 photographic plates. The Yerkes was the second largest telescope in world when it was lit up, the other larger one was the Paris Observatory's 122 cm reflector. During this time, there were many questions about the merits of the various materials used to construct telescopes. Another large telescope of this period was the Great Melbourne Telescope, which offered strong competition in this time period to the glass and lens telescopes.",
