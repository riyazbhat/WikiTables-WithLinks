Two Union and Three Confederate soldiers were killed, and the Union cavalry retreated to Cave City, leaving Glasgow in Morgan's hands. Braxton Bragg went through the town on his way to capturing Kentucky's capital of Frankfort and the Battle of Perryville.\n The President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, gave a Medal of Honor to one enlisted man in every company that gave the Confederacy a \"signal victory\".

Four of these came from the Battle of Stone's River, and three were from the Battle of Chickamauga; both battles were fought in Tennessee, not Kentucky.
