  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.  It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. The eastern border uniquely comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges, rivers, seas, and straits that would normally define a subcontinent. However, Europe retains its status as a full continent because of its great size and the weight of history and tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world.",
  "/wiki/Atlas_II": "Atlas II was a member of the Atlas family of launch vehicles, which evolved from the successful Atlas missile program of the 1950s.

It is a liquid-fueled two-stage rocket, first launched in 1967 and with over 420 successful launches to its name. The Kosmos-3M uses UDMH fuel and AK27I oxidizer (red fuming nitric acid) to lift roughly 1,400\u00a0kg (3,100\u00a0lb) of payload into orbit. It differed from the earlier Kosmos-3 in its finer control of the second-stage burn, allowing operators to tune the thrust and even channel it through nozzles that helped orient the rocket for the launching of multiple satellites at one time.  PO Polyot has manufactured these launch vehicles in the Russian town of Omsk for decades. It was originally scheduled to be retired from service in 2011; however, in April 2010 the Commander of the Russian Space Forces confirmed that it would be retired by the end of 2010. One further launch, with Kanopus-ST, was planned; however, this was cancelled in late 2012 as the rocket had exceeded its design life while in storage ahead of the launch.",
