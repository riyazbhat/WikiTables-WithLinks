It is used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). German and French government agencies worked closely together to develop the Ariane. Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by Arianespace as part of the Ariane programme. The rockets are launched by Arianespace  from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. Ariane 5 succeeded Ariane 4, but was not derived from it directly as Ariane 5 was developed from scratch.",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent. However, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population.",
