  "/wiki/Netherlands_Antilles_at_the_Olympics": "The Netherlands Antilles participated at the Olympic Games from 1952 until 2008. As a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it supported the Netherlands' boycott of the 1956 Games and also joined the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. The Netherlands Antilles participated in the Winter Olympic Games twice.\n The National Olympic Committee for the Netherlands Antilles was created in 1931 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee from 1950 until 2011 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. At the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.",
  "/wiki/Australasia_at_the_Olympics": "Australasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics.  When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.",
  "/wiki/Bohemia_at_the_Olympics": "Kingdom of Bohemia, an autonomous part of Austria-Hungary until 1918, competed at some of the early modern Olympic Games.  The team made its debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics.  After World War I, Bohemia became part of the new Czechoslovakia, and Bohemian athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics.  After the 1992 Summer Olympics and the dissolution of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, Bohemian athletes competed for the Czech Republic at the Olympics.  If these post-war appearances are counted, Bohemia has missed only three Olympics: the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics, the 1904 Summer Olympics (the first held outside Europe)  and the boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics.",
  "/wiki/British_West_Indies_at_the_1960_Summer_Olympics": "Athletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT) at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors, all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports. The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games.  The team won two bronze medals, both in track and field athletics.",
  "/wiki/United_Team_of_Germany_at_the_Olympics": "The United Team of Germany (German: Gesamtdeutsche Mannschaft) competed in the 1956, 1960, and 1964 Winter and Summer Olympic Games as a united team of athletes from West Germany and East Germany. In 1956 the team also included athletes from a third Olympic body, the Saarland Olympic Committee, which had sent a separate team in 1952, but in 1956 was in the process of joining the German National Olympic Committee. This process was completed in February 1957 after the admission of Saarland into the Federal Republic of Germany.",
  "/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_Olympics": "The Unified Team was the name used for the sports team of the former Soviet Union \n(except the Baltic states) at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The IOC country code was EUN, after the French name, \u00c9quipe unifi\u00e9e.  The Unified Team was sometimes informally called the CIS Team (Commonwealth of Independent States, as a counterpart of CIS national football team taking part in Euro 1992 of the same year), although Georgia did not join the CIS until 1993.\n During the Winter Olympics, the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the IOC, so the Olympic Flag was used in place of a national flag at the Opening Ceremony and at medals ceremonies, and the Olympic Hymn was played for gold medallists.  By the time of the Summer Olympics, the NOCs had affiliated separately, though they fielded a joint team with a standard uniform as Olympic qualifying rounds had been completed before the final demise of the Soviet Union.  Where an EUN individual won a medal, the national flag of the medallist's nation was raised rather than the Olympic flag, and a gold medallist's national anthem was played rather than the Olympic Hymn.  In team sports, the EUN team continued to use the Olympic flag and the Olympic Hymn, as team members represented different nations.\n The team finished second in the medal table at the 1992 Winter Games, and first at the 1992 Summer Games, edging its old rival the US in the latter.",
  "/wiki/West_Germany_at_the_Olympics": "West Germany competed at the Olympic Games between 1952 and 1988. While in  1952  - Germany's first Olympics after World War II and the Partitions of Germany - there was a de facto West German team, given East Germany refused to collaborate, its results are counted towards Germany. Likewise, between 1956 and 1964 both countries competed together under the United Team of Germany flag. It was not until 1968 that a full-fledged West German team appeared, and it competed in all the Olympics but the 1980 Summer Olympics - as it supported the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott - until 1988. Afterwards, the German reunification in 1990 reestablished the German team.",
  "/wiki/East_Germany_at_the_Olympics": "The German Democratic Republic (GDR), often called East Germany, founded a separate National Olympic Committee for socialist East Germany on 22 April 1951 in the Rotes Rathaus of East Berlin. This was the last of three German Olympic committees of the time. It was not recognized by the IOC for over a decade.",
  "/wiki/Russian_Empire_at_the_Olympics": "Russia has competed at the modern Olympic Games on many occasions, but as different nations in its history.  As the Russian Empire, the nation first competed at the 1900 Games, and returned again in 1908 and 1912.  After the Russian revolution in 1917, and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, it would be forty years until Russian athletes again competed at the Olympics, as the Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992, and finally returned again as Russia for the 1994 Winter Olympics.",
  "/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro_at_the_Olympics": "The former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro appeared at the Olympic Games on two occasions from 2004 until 2006, after which the union was dissolved and Montenegro and Serbia each declared full independence.",
  "/wiki/Czechoslovakia_at_the_Olympics": "Czechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they participated in the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics.\nCzechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994.\n Czechoslovak athletes have won a total of 143 medals at the Summer Games, mostly in gymnastics. The nation also won 25 medals at the Winter Games, with ski jumping and ice hockey as the top medal-producing sports.",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics": "The Soviet Union first participated at the Olympic Games in 1952, and competed at the Games on 18 occasions subsequently. At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games, the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won, it was second by this count on the other three. Similarly, the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games. Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state's investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international stage. Following the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917-1922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds; however, after World War II (1939-1945), attendance at the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting Communist ideals. The Olympic Committee of the USSR was formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement. The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes.",
  "/wiki/Yugoslavia_at_the_Olympics": "Teams from Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. Previously, several athletes from Croatia, Slovenia and northern Serbian province Vojvodina had competed for Austria or Hungary when those countries were part of the Empire of Austria-Hungary. A small team of two athletes had competed distinctly for Serbia at the 1912 Summer Olympics.\n Yugoslavia has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:",
  "/wiki/Mixed_team_at_the_Olympics": "Early modern Olympic Games allowed for individuals in a team to be from different nations.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) grouped their results together under the mixed team designation (IOC code ZZX).[citation needed]\n A total of 17 medals were won by mixed teams in the first three modern Games, from 1896 to 1904.[citation needed]",
  "/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) uses three-letter abbreviation country codes to refer to each group of athletes that participate in the Olympic Games.  Each geocode usually identifies a National Olympic Committee (NOC), but there are several codes that have been used for other instances in past Games, such as teams composed of athletes from multiple nations, or groups of athletes not formally representing any nation.\n Several of the IOC codes are different from the standard ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes. Other sporting organisations, such as FIFA, use similar country codes to refer to their respective teams, but with some differences. Still others, such as the Commonwealth Games Federation or Association of Tennis Professionals, use the IOC list verbatim."
