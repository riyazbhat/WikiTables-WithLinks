  "/wiki/2006\u201307_Nashville_Predators_season": "The 2006\u201307 Nashville Predators season was the ninth National Hockey League season in Nashville, Tennessee. The Predators, looking to get past the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in franchise history, bulked up their roster by signing star forward Jason Arnott, whose 76 points in 2005\u201306 was second on the Dallas Stars. With returning forwards Paul Kariya and Steve Sullivan, and the acquisition of Arnott and Jean-Pierre Dumont, the Predators were predicted to challenge the Detroit Red Wings for top spot in the Central Division. Although the Predators were leading the Central when the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game was played in Dallas, Texas, only one Predator player was named to the Western Conference team. Defenseman and team captain Kimmo Timonen played in his second All-Star Game. Head Coach Barry Trotz served as an assistant coach for the Western Conference. The attendance in Nashville had been a topic of much media debate all season long, with the Predators' attendance being in the bottom third of the league despite the team leading its division for most of the season. There had been much speculation in February about a clause in the Predators lease with the city that could force the city of Nashville to buy $2 million worth of tickets for the Predators in the 2007\u201308 season if the team failed to reach a paid average attendance of 14,000.",

Known for his on-ice vision and physical play, Forsberg is considered one of the greatest players of all time. Although his career was shortened by persistent injuries, as of 2014, he stands eighth all-time in career points-per-game and fourth all-time in career assists-per-game in the NHL, only behind Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Bobby Orr. In 2017 Forsberg was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. His 19-year professional career includes 13 years in the National Hockey League (NHL), where he won two Stanley Cups with the Colorado Avalanche, as well as several individual honors including the Hart Memorial Trophy in 2003. As of the end of the 2017\u201318 season, he is the seventh-highest all-time Swedish point scorer in the NHL regular season. Before his short-lived comeback season in 2011, Forsberg never had a negative plus-minus rating, giving him an overall career rating of +238. Representing Sweden in international play, Forsberg competed in four Winter Olympics, two World Cups and five World Championships, as well as one European Junior Championship and two World Junior Championships, where he holds a scoring record of 31 points in seven games that some say may never be broken.",
  "/wiki/2007\u201308_Nashville_Predators_season": "The 2007\u201308 Nashville Predators season began October 4, 2007. It was their tenth season in the National Hockey League. The 2007 off-season was dominated by the attempted purchase of the Predators by Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie, who signed a letter of intent to purchase the team for at least $220 million. The attempted sale led to widespread speculation that Balsillie intended to relocate the team to Hamilton, Ontario, if the Predators failed to reach a 14,000 paid average attendance in 2007\u201308, allowing the team to break its lease. Balsillie had already entered negotiations on a lease at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton. Despite calling the negotiations a contingency plan, Balsillie petitioned the NHL to decide on his ability to relocate the franchise at the same time the NHL Board of Governors voted on his purchase of the team. However, the deal was ended by Predators Owner Craig Leipold on June 22, as he informed the NHL that he was pulling out of the agreement due to a lack of a finalized sale agreement and over concerns that Balsillie would relocate the team to Hamilton. On August 1, a group led by local businessman David Freeman issued a letter of intent to purchase the Predators.",
