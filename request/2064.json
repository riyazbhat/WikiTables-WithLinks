It is performed either at compile time or run-time in order to produce functional machine-readable code. There is a public perception, so far unsupported by any legal precedent or citation, that without applying the linking exception, a program linked to GPL library code may only be distributed under a GPL-compatible license.[irrelevant citation] The license of the GNU Classpath project explicitly includes a statement to that effect.",
