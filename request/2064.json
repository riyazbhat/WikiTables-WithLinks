  "/wiki/GPL_linking_exception": "A GPL linking exception modifies the GNU General Public License (GPL) in a way that enables software projects which provide library code to be linked to the programs that use them, without applying the full terms of the GPL to the using program. Linking is the technical process of connecting code in a library to the using code, to produce a single executable file. It is performed either at compile time or run-time in order to produce functional machine-readable code. There is a public perception, so far unsupported by any legal precedent or citation, that without applying the linking exception, a program linked to GPL library code may only be distributed under a GPL-compatible license. [irrelevant citation] The license of the GNU Classpath project explicitly includes a statement to that effect. Many free software libraries which are distributed under the GPL use an equivalent exception, although the wording of the exception varies. Notable projects include ERIKA Enterprise, GNU Guile, the run-time libraries of GNAT, GNU Classpath and the famous GCC Runtime Library Exception. Compiler runtime libraries also often use this license modification or an equivalent one, e.g.",
  "/wiki/Active_Directory": "Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services. A server running Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) is called a domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network\u2014assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it allows management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Active Directory Federation Services, Lightweight Directory Services, and Rights Management Services.",

  "/wiki/Apple_Open_Directory": "Apple Open Directory is the LDAP directory service model implementation from Apple Inc. A directory service is software which stores and organizes information about a computer network's users and network resources and which allows network administrators to manage users' access to the resources. In the context of macOS Server, Open Directory describes a shared LDAPv3 directory domain and a corresponding authentication model composed of Apple Password Server and Kerberos 5 tied together using a modular Directory Services system. Apple Open Directory is a fork of OpenLDAP. The term Open Directory can also be used to describe the entire directory services framework used by macOS and macOS Server. In this context, it describes the role of a macOS or macOS Server system when it is connected to an existing directory domain, in which context it is sometimes referred to as Directory Services. Apple, Inc. also publishes an API called the OpenDirectory framework, permitting macOS applications to interrogate and edit the Open Directory data. With the release of Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), Apple chose to move away from using the NetInfo directory service (originally found in NeXTSTEP and OpenStep), which had been used by default for all local accounts and groups in every release of Mac OS X from 10.0 to 10.4.

It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019[update], Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, \nparticularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.

This is in distinction to permissive software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use. Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A.
