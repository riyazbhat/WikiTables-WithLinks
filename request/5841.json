  "/wiki/McMillan_Hall": "McMillan Hall is a building on the campus of Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania, United States. Built in 1793, it is the only surviving building from Washington Academy. It is the eighth-oldest academic building in the United States that is still in use for its original academic purpose and is the oldest surviving college building west of the Allegheny Mountains.\n The building is situated on the corner of South Lincoln Street and East Wheeling Street in Washington, Pennsylvania. It is 120 feet (37\u00a0m) by 40 feet (12\u00a0m) in size. McMillan Hall is named after College founder and Presbyterian missionary John McMillan. Throughout its history, McMillan has also been known as the \"Old College,\" the \"Academy Building,\" and the \"Administration Building.\" It is currently home to administrative offices, including the Office of Communications and the Office of the President. The College's ceremonial mace is carved from the original wooden pillars.\n In 1977, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register described the building's architecture as achieving a \"unique quality and charm from the fact that vernacular builders selectively borrowed Georgian, Roman Classical, Adamesque, and other European Renaissance architectural forms, elements, and details and combined them in the builder's own esoteric way.\" The National Register described its historical importance as a \"unique variation of a Western Pennsylvania stone building,\" calling it \"irreplaceable on a regional or national level.\"\n In 1793, the Trustees of Washington Academy authorized the construction of a new building. Alexander Hamilton and Henry Lee stayed in the hall during their visit during Whiskey Rebellion. The 2-story stone building was ready for occupation in 1797. Two wings and a portico were added in 1818, allowing the building to house dormitories and dining facilities for students. In 1900, the building was saved from planned demolition by a benefactor who insisted that it be preserved. In order to make room for the proposed library, it was moved 40 feet (12\u00a0m) towards Lincoln Street. The building was remodeled in 1912 to house administrative offices. In 1928, the north wing, which had been used as student housing, was remodeled to create office space. At various times, the basement housed a dining hall, a lunch counter, classrooms, and the bookstore. It was restored to its 18th-century appearance in the late 1980s.\n It is designated as a historic public landmark by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Washington_&_Jefferson_College_buildings": "Washington & Jefferson College is a private liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania, which is located in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in Washington County, Pennsylvania established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the American frontier in the 1780s: John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith. These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges, with Canonsburg Academy, later Jefferson College, located in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania and Washington Academy, later Washington College, in Washington. These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington & Jefferson College.\n The campus, the historic entrances of which are marked by brick gates, has over 40 buildings. The oldest surviving building is McMillan Hall, which dates to 1793 and is the oldest college building west of the Allegheny Mountains. The main academic building is Old Main, which is topped with two prominent towers. The Old Gym houses a modern exercise facility. McIlvaine Hall, which was originally home to a female seminary, was demolished in 2008 and replaced by the Swanson Science Center. The Olin Fine Arts Center is a 488-seat auditorium. Davis Memorial Hall was once a dormitory and private house. The Thistle Physics Building, the Lazear Chemistry Hall, and the Dieter-Porter Life Sciences Building all cater to the scientific curriculum.  The Burnett Center and its sister building, the Technology Center, were built in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n The first dormitory on campus was Hays Hall. Wade House, Carriage House, and Whitworth House are Victorian homes housing older students. The recently constructed Chestnut Street Housing complex provides housing for the college's Greek organizations.

It is located at the junction of Pennsylvania Route 88 and Mingo Church Road in Union Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, near Courtney, Pennsylvania. It is a member of the Washington Presbytery.\n The original log Presbyterian meetinghouse was built in 1793.  The Mingo Creek Society, a group of dissidents founded in February 1794 that became involved in protest against the federal whiskey excise tax, met there.  It would serve as a focal point in the development of the Whiskey Rebellion, even becoming the site of militia musters in the fight against federal forces. Some militia members are buried on the grounds, including Major James McFarlane, revolutionary war veteran, mortally wounded at the July 1794 battle of Bower Hill during the climax of the resistance of the Whiskey Rebellion at the residence of John Neville .\n In the early years, the church was served by circuit-riding preachers who ministered to the early settlers of the era.  Many of the service were held underneath a young oak tree.  In 1990, that tree had grown large, but had become infested by ants.  In response, the church members removed most of the tree, but left the base of the trunk, which they then carved into a statue of a circuit-riding preacher.  \"Reverend Stump,\" as it was called. The stump still stands, but is still plagued by carpenter ants.\n In 1994, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the location.

Its purpose is to encourage and assist the preservation of historic structures in Washington County, Pennsylvania.  The foundation operates its own landmark certification process, as well as working with the National Park Service to document and place landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places.  It also offers advice and assistance for historic building owners who wish to preserve their facilities.  Since its inception, the foundation has been successful in helping many historic building owners in the preservation of their structures.\n For a number of years, the foundation has been in conflict with Washington & Jefferson College.  In 1968, the college's campus master plan called for the expansion of the campus eastward towards Wade Avenue in East Washington Borough, a plan that placed them in conflict with the residents of that area.  For the next 30 years, the college maintained a policy of purchasing any homes in that area as they became available.  In response, the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation was able to get the East Washington Historic District, a collection of 120 Victorian homes in that area, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  The college opposed the designation but did not object in time to prevent it.  According to College President Howard J. Burnett, the district \"was structured to prevent expansion of the college.\"\n In the 1990s, the hard feelings between some residents and the College came to a head, with residents trying to have the Borough enact anti-demolition laws to block expansion and a meeting of the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation deteriorated into a shouting match between residents and college officials.  Burnett maintained that the expansion was beneficial to the community and that the opposition came from a small and non-representative group on Wade Avenue.  He also questioned the historic value of many of the designated homes, pointing out that many of them were in very poor shape and others were vacant.  As of 1995, the college owned about 30 properties listed in the historic district.  In the end, efforts to block the demolition of these buildings, including several which were part of the historic district,  were unsuccessful.  Notably, one 140-year-old farm house at 137 South Wade Street, which the college had acquired in 1977 after being vacant for several years, was moved to a new location outside of town.\n In 2009, the foundation sponsored an architectural survey of buildings in the African American areas of Washington."
