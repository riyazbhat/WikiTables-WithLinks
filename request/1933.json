  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \nk\ng\nm\n2\ns\n\u2212\n3\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",
  "/wiki/Washington_(state)": "Washington (/\u02c8w\u0252\u0283\u026a\u014bt\u0259n/ (listen)), officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Named for George Washington, the first U.S. president, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state, which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington State to distinguish it from the nation's capital, Washington, D.C..\n Washington is the 18th largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km2), and the 13th most populous state, with more than 7.4 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.",
  "/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation": "The United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and formerly the United States Reclamation Service, is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees water resource management, specifically as it applies to the oversight and operation of the diversion, delivery, and storage projects that it has built throughout the western United States for irrigation, water supply, and attendant hydroelectric power generation. Currently the USBR is the largest wholesaler of water in the country, bringing water to more than 31 million people, and providing one in five Western farmers with irrigation water for 10 million acres of farmland, which produce 60% of the nation's vegetables and 25% of its fruits and nuts. The USBR is also the second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the western United States. On June 17, 1902, in accordance with the Reclamation Act, Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock established the U.S. Reclamation Service within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The new Reclamation Service studied potential water development projects in each western state with federal lands\u2014revenue from sale of federal lands was the initial source of the program's funding. Because Texas had no federal lands, it did not become a Reclamation state until 1906, when Congress passed a law including it in the provisions of the Reclamation Act.",
  "/wiki/Easton_Diversion_Dam": "The Easton Diversion Dam is a diversion dam on the Yakima River In western Kittitas County near Easton, Washington. The dam is 66 feet (20 m) high, and 248 feet (76 m) long along the crest. Construction of the dam began in 1928 and was completed the next year. It is currently owned by the Bureau of Reclamation and operated by the Kittitas Reclamation District.",
  "/wiki/Roza_Dam": "Roza Dam (National ID # WA00275) is a diversion dam on the Yakima River, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Yakima, just west of SR 821. The dam, built in 1939, is 486 feet (148 m) long at the crest and 67 feet (20 m) high, and impounds approximately 100 acres (40 ha) of water.

  "/wiki/Horn_Rapids_Dam": "Horn Rapids Dam (also known as Wanawish Dam) is a rock filled timber crib barrage dam on the Yakima River in Benton County, Washington near the intersection of SR 240 and SR 225. The dam is not used for hydroelectric production, rather to fill irrigation canals on either bank of the river. Permits for the dam were filed by the Yakima Irrigation and Improvement Company in 1889, and the original dam was completed in 1892. When the company went under in 1896, the dam was bought by the Northwestern Pacific Company (a subsidiary of Northern Pacific). A more substantial dam was put in place in 1908, when the northern irrigation canal was built. The dam was damaged in a flood in 1996, but was replaced by a concrete structure in 1997. Former Camp Columbia (occasionally referred to as Columbia Camp) was located on the north bank of the river just above the dam. This was a prison camp during World War II for low-security prisoners; political dissidents and the like."
