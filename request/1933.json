  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt (symbol: W) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. In SI base units, the watt is described as \n\n\n\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle kg\\,m^{2}s^{-3}}\n\n, which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis. The watt is named after James Watt, an 18th century scottish inventor.",
  "/wiki/Washington_(state)": "Washington (/\u02c8w\u0252\u0283\u026a\u014bt\u0259n/ (listen)), officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Named for George Washington, the first U.S. president, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state, which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington State to distinguish it from the nation's capital, Washington, D.C..\n Washington is the 18th largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km2), and the 13th most populous state, with more than 7.4 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California. Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano, is the state's highest elevation, at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S.\n Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the US's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in the production of wine.\n Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, ship-building, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes, including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n Washington is one of the wealthiest and most socially progressive states in the country. The state consistently ranks among the best for life expectancy and low unemployment. Along with Colorado, Washington was one of the first to legalize medicinal and recreational cannabis, was among the first thirty-six states to legalize same-sex marriage, doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal abortions on request before the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade loosened abortion laws nationwide. Similarly, Washington voters approved a 2008 referendum on legalization of physician-assisted suicide, and is currently only one of five states, along with Oregon, California, Colorado and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia to have legalized the practice. The state is also one of eight in the country to have criminalized the sale, possession and transfer of bump stocks, with California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Maryland, and Massachusetts also having banned these devices.",
  "/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation": "The United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and formerly the United States Reclamation Service, is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees water resource management, specifically as it applies to the oversight and operation of the diversion, delivery, and storage projects that it has built throughout the western United States for irrigation, water supply, and attendant hydroelectric power generation. Currently the USBR is the largest wholesaler of water in the country, bringing water to more than 31 million people, and providing one in five Western farmers with irrigation water for 10 million acres of farmland, which produce 60% of the nation's vegetables and 25% of its fruits and nuts. The USBR is also the second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the western United States.\n On June 17, 1902, in accordance with the Reclamation Act, Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock established the U.S. Reclamation Service within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The new Reclamation Service studied potential water development projects in each western state with federal lands\u2014revenue from sale of federal lands was the initial source of the program's funding. Because Texas had no federal lands, it did not become a Reclamation state until 1906, when Congress passed a law including it in the provisions of the Reclamation Act.",
  "/wiki/Easton_Diversion_Dam": "The Easton Diversion Dam is a diversion dam on the Yakima River In western Kittitas County near Easton, Washington. The dam is 66 feet (20 m) high, and 248 feet (76 m) long along the crest.\n Construction of the dam began in 1928 and was completed the next year. It is currently owned by the Bureau of Reclamation and operated by the Kittitas Reclamation District.",
  "/wiki/Roza_Dam": "Roza Dam (National ID # WA00275) is a diversion dam on the Yakima River, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Yakima, just west of SR 821.  The dam, built in 1939, is 486 feet (148 m) long at the crest and 67 feet (20 m) high, and impounds approximately 100 acres (40 ha) of water.  The dam also has 12,000 kW power production capacity, online as of 1956.  There is also an adult fish ladder at this location.",
  "/wiki/Horn_Rapids_Dam": "Horn Rapids Dam (also known as Wanawish Dam) is a rock filled timber crib barrage dam on the Yakima River in Benton County, Washington near the intersection of SR 240 and SR 225.  The dam is not used for hydroelectric production, rather to fill irrigation canals on either bank of the river.\n Permits for the dam were filed by the Yakima Irrigation and Improvement Company in 1889, and the original dam was completed in 1892.  When the company went under in 1896, the dam was bought by the Northwestern Pacific Company (a subsidiary of Northern Pacific).  A more substantial dam was put in place in 1908, when the northern irrigation canal was built.  The dam was damaged in a flood in 1996, but was replaced by a concrete structure in 1997.\n Former Camp Columbia (occasionally referred to as Columbia Camp) was located on the north bank of the river just above the dam.  This was a prison camp during World War II for low-security prisoners; political dissidents and the like.  The camp was operated from 1944 through 1947.  There were barracks and a large orchard, but no perimeter fences, and inmates were allowed to move about freely.\n The dam is still used as a historic fishing location by the Yakama Indian Nation, and traditional fishing scaffolds can be seen there year-round.",
  "/wiki/List_of_dams_in_the_Columbia_River_watershed": "There are more than 60 dams in the Columbia River watershed in the United States and Canada. Tributaries of the Columbia River and their dammed tributaries, as well as the main stem itself, each have their own list below. The dams are listed in the order as they are found from source to terminus. Many of the dams in the Columbia River watershed were not created for the specific purposes of water storage or flood protection. Instead, the primary purpose of many of these dams is to produce hydroelectricity. As can be seen in the lists, these dams provide many tens of gigawatts of power.\n Major dam construction began in the early 20th century and picked up the pace after the Columbia River Treaty in the 1960s, by the mid 1980s all the big dams were finished. Including just the dams listed below, there are 60 dams in the watershed, with 14 on the Columbia, 20 on the Snake, seven on the Kootenay, seven on the Pend Oreille / Clark, two on the Flathead, eight on the Yakima, and two on the Owyhee. Averaging a major dam every 72 miles (116 km), the rivers in the Columbia watershed combine to generate over 36,000 megawatts of power, with the majority coming on the main stem. Grand Coulee Dam is the largest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States, generating 6,809 megawatts, over one-sixth of all power in the basin.\n In addition to providing ample power for the people of the Pacific Northwest, the reservoirs created by the dams have created numerous recreational opportunities, including fishing, boating, and windsurfing. Furthermore, by creating a constant flow and consistent depth along the river channel, the series of locks and dams have allowed for Lewiston, Idaho, to become the furthest inland seaport on the west coast of the United States. Despite the numerous benefits to humans that the dams have provided, a number of environmental consequences have manifested as a result of the dams, including a negative impact on salmonid populations of the basin.\n The organization of the following lists begins with the Columbia River dams and is followed by dams on its tributaries (in order of length) and their respective watersheds. Additionally, the table of contents below is indented to indicate tributary status of each river."
