Since 1927 Fianna F\u00e1il has been one of Ireland's two major parties, along with Fine Gael; both are seen as being centre-right parties, and as being to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn F\u00e9in.

Between 1989 and 2011, it led coalition governments with parties of both the left and the right.\n Fianna F\u00e1il was last in government from 1997 to 2011 under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002, reduced to 77 in 2007 and then to 20 in 2011 (during the post-2008 economic downturn), the lowest in the party's history.

He was educated in Dungannon and at Queen's University Belfast. Between 1964 and 1972, he was the Nationalist Party Stormont MP for East Tyrone. On 20 June 1968, with others including mediator Father Tom Savage, he began a protest about discrimination in housing allocation by squatting (illegally occupying) in a house in a new council development in Caledon, County Tyrone. The house had been allocated by Dungannon Rural District Council to a 19-year-old unmarried Protestant woman, Emily Beattie, who was the secretary of a local Unionist politician. All 14 houses in the new council development had been allocated to Protestants. The protesters were evicted by officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), one of whom was Emily Beattie's brother. The next day the annual conference of the Nationalist Party unanimously approved of the protest action by Austin Currie in Caledon. This was one of the catalysts of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.\n He became an active member in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association.

  "/wiki/Progressive_Democrats": "The Progressive Democrats (Irish: An P\u00e1irt\u00ed Daonlathach, literally The Democratic Party, PDs) was a conservative-liberal political party in the Republic of Ireland.\n Launched on 21 December 1985 by Desmond O'Malley and other politicians who had split from Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats took liberal positions on divorce, contraception, and other social issues. The party also supported economic liberalisation, advocating measures such as lower taxation, fiscal conservatism, privatisation, and welfare reform. It enjoyed an impressive d\u00e9but at the 1987 general election, winning 14 seats in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and capturing almost 12 per cent of the popular vote to temporarily surpass the Labour Party as Ireland's third-largest political party.\n Although the Progressive Democrats never again won more than 10 seats in the D\u00e1il, they formed coalition governments with Fianna F\u00e1il during the 26th D\u00e1il (1989\u201392), the 28th D\u00e1il (1997\u20132002), the 29th D\u00e1il (2002\u201307) and the 30th Dail (2007\u201309). These successive years as the government's junior coalition partner gave the party an influence on Irish politics and economics disproportionate to its small size. In particular, the party has been credited with shaping the low-tax, pro-business environment that contributed to Ireland's Celtic Tiger economic boom during the 1990s and 2000s, as well as blamed for contributing to the subsequent Irish financial and economic crisis.\n On 8 November 2008 the party began the process of disbanding, and was formally dissolved on 20 November 2009. The two Progressive Democrat politicians elected to the 30th D\u00e1il, Mary Harney and Noel Grealish, continued to support the government as independent TDs, and Mary Harney also continued as Minister for Health and Children.\n The party was a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR).

It made breakthroughs in recent elections, placing third in first preference votes in the most recent European Parliament and United Kingdom general election, winning one of the three Northern Ireland seats in the European Parliament, and one seat, North Down in the House of Commons respectively.\n Founded in 1970 from the New Ulster Movement, the Alliance Party originally represented moderate and non-sectarian unionism.  However, over time, particularly in the 1990s, it moved towards neutrality on the Union, and has come to represent wider liberal and non-sectarian concerns. It opposes the consociational power-sharing mandated by the Good Friday Agreement as deepening the sectarian divide, and, in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is designated as neither unionist nor Irish nationalist, but 'Other'.\n In  general election in May 2010 the Alliance Party won their first House of Commons seat in a UK-wide general election, in the Belfast East constituency, unseating Peter Robinson, First Minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Naomi Long was the first MP from the Alliance Party since Stratton Mills, who joined the party from the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 1973. However, the DUP regained the seat at the 2015 general election following an electoral pact with the UUP, leaving the Alliance Party with no representation in the House of Commons.

The following year under the redistribution and expansion of Northern Ireland's constituencies his local political base became part of the new Lagan Valley constituency which he has contested in the Alliance interest in all elections since 1983 apart from the 1986 by-election called in protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement when the local Alliance branch declined to contest the seat as they believed the by-election was a political stunt.\n Close also held several positions in the Alliance, including serving as Chair between 1981 and 1982 and as Deputy Leader from 1991 until 2001. He was often a member of the key Alliance delegations in successive talks about the future of the province, culminating in the Belfast Agreement of 1998.\n In the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum, Close stood at the head of the Alliance's list for Lagan Valley but the party failed to secure enough votes to win one of the local seats.

  "/wiki/Gordon_Wilson_(peace_campaigner)": "Gordon Wilson (25 September 1927 \u2013 27 June 1995) was a draper in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, who became known as a peace campaigner during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. \n On 8 November 1987 a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded during Enniskillen's Remembrance Day parade, injuring Wilson and fatally injuring his daughter Marie, a nurse. The bomb was planted in a nearby building and timed to go off at 10:43 am, just before the ceremony was due to start.  An emotional television interview Wilson gave to the BBC only hours after the bombing brought him to national and international prominence as he described his last conversation with his dying daughter as they both lay buried in rubble.\n Wilson's response to the bombing, \"I bear no ill will. I bear no grudge\", was reported worldwide, becoming among the most-remembered quotations from the Troubles. Whereas IRA attacks in Northern Ireland often resulted in reprisals by loyalists, Wilson's calls for forgiveness and reconciliation came to be called the Spirit of Enniskillen.\n As a peace campaigner, Wilson held many meetings with members of Sinn F\u00e9in. He also met once with representatives of the Provisional IRA. Wilson sought to understand the reasons for the Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen. He also held talks with loyalist paramilitaries in an attempt to persuade them to abandon violence.\n On Remembrance Day 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams formally apologised for the bombing.",
