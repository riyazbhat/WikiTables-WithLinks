While the National Football League (NFL) does not recognize the Browns\u2019 AAFC championships, the Pro Football Hall of Fame does recognize the team\u2019s championships, which is reflected in this list. When the AAFC folded in 1949, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. The Browns went on to win three NFL championships, nearly dominating the NFL in the 1950s, and won one more NFL championship in 1964. The team has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, however. Overall, the team has won eight championships: four in the AAFC, and four in the NFL.  \n In 1995, then-Browns owner Art Modell made the decision to move the team from Cleveland, Ohio to Baltimore, Maryland. An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team\u2019s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell\u2019s new team would be regarded as an expansion team.

Early in this period the Dolphins won their only two Super Bowls in consecutive seasons, in the process achieving the only modern-day perfect season in any major professional sports league during only their third year in the NFL. Much of this success was orchestrated by coach Don Shula who joined the team in 1970 and stayed with them until his retirement in 1995.\n After Shula retired in 1995, the Dolphins remained a force for six years under successors Jimmy Johnson and Dave Wannstedt, but since 2002 and especially since 2004 have fallen on harder times, reaching the postseason only twice in the twelve seasons since, and during the mid-2000s, briefly intensified the Dolphins-Patriots rivalry, when Nick Saban, a former Bill Belichick assistant was hired as the Dolphins head coach in 2005 and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins the following year. In 2007, if not for their overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens, would've suffered an imperfect season, a year before the Detroit Lions became the first team to go winless since the NFL expanded to a 16-game schedule.

The Cowboys have played for 10 NFL Championships and have won 5, all five being Super Bowls.\n The Cowboys won Super Bowls VI, XII, XXVII, XXVIII and XXX.

The first period of success came from 1966\u20131985 when the Cowboys played in the postseason 18 times.  During this period, they played in two NFL Championships and five Super Bowls, winning two of them, winning a total of 20 playoff games.  The second period of success was between 1991\u20131996 when the Cowboys captured five straight NFC East Division titles and won three Super Bowls going 12\u20133 in the postseason.\n Outside of these two periods of success, the Cowboys have experienced  short periods of failure in their history. The three most notable periods of failure was from their 1960 inaugural season to 1965, during which the Cowboys did not have a single postseason appearance.  They did not win a single game during their first season, compiling an 0\u201311\u20131 record that is still the worst in franchise history.  Also, they did not have a single winning record in this period. \nBetween 1986 and 1990 the Cowboys had losing records in each season as veteran coach Landry retired and the team was radically overhauled, with the low point being the NFL's second 15-loss season (after the 1980 Saints) in 1989. After losing a Divisional playoff Game in 1996, the Cowboys between 1997 and 2008 lost five consecutive playoff games, one after a franchise-record 13\u20133 season in 2007, during which most predicted the Cowboys would break this streak. This streak finally came to an end when the Cowboys beat their bitter rival, the Philadelphia Eagles 34\u201314 after an 11\u20135 season in 2009.\n Nonetheless, through the 2018 NFL season, the Cowboys holds the league's all-time best winning percentage (.574) and has made more playoff appearances than any other NFL team (33).

Rosenbloom was granted an NFL team, and was awarded the holdings of the defunct Dallas Texans organization. The new team was named the Colts after the previous team that folded after the 1950 NFL season. After 31 seasons in Baltimore, Colts owner Robert Irsay moved the team to Indianapolis, Indiana.\n The Colts have won two Super Bowl championships (Super Bowl V and Super Bowl XLI). They also played in and lost Super Bowl III and Super Bowl XLIV. Before the AFL and NFL merged in 1970, they won three NFL Championships (1958, 1959, and 1968). By winning Super Bowl XLI the Colts became the first team that played its home games in a domed stadium to win a Super Bowl held in an outdoor stadium.\n After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired Tony Dungy in 2002, the Colts made the playoffs for nine straight seasons. They won five straight AFC South titles from 2003 to 2007 and had seven consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories from 2003 to 2009, the first time that has been achieved in the NFL's 90-year history. Much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager Bill Polian, coach Dungy, and quarterback Peyton Manning.\n In the 2013 season, the Colts secured their first division championship since Manning's departure and first under quarterback Andrew Luck and head coach Chuck Pagano.",

  "/wiki/List_of_Seattle_Seahawks_seasons": "This article is a compilation of the list of seasons completed by the Seattle Seahawks American football franchise of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents the season-by-season records of the Seahawks' franchise from 1976 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches. As of the end of the 2018 NFL season, the Seahawks have 23 winning seasons, 17 losing seasons, and 4 seasons where they finished 8\u20138. With a 35\u20136 Week 14 win over the Baltimore Ravens on December 13 during the 2015 season, not only did the Seahawks improved to 8\u20135 at that point in the season, but the Seahawks' all\u2013time franchise regular season win\u2013loss record improved to 313\u2013312\u20130; this marked the first time ever in team history that the Seahawks have had an overall winning regular season win\u2013loss record (a win\u2013loss record above .500). Since re-joining the National Football Conference in 2002, the Seahawks have compiled a record of 156\u2013115\u20131 (as of the end of the 2018 season).  Also since then, the Seahawks have had only four losing seasons (all between 2008 and 2011), although their 2010 team won the Western division title, despite finishing with a 7\u20139 record.  Counting their inaugural 1976 season, where they finished 2\u201312, Seattle's overall record as an NFC franchise is 158\u2013127\u20131.\n The Seahawks are the one of four North American men's professional sports teams that have played in Seattle with an all\u2013time winning record, after the Seattle Metropolitans (the first American team to win the Stanley Cup in 1917, folded in 1924), the Seattle SuperSonics (who relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder in the summer of 2008), and the Seattle Sounders FC (established in 2007 as an expansion franchise, currently active). Therefore, the Seahawks are currently one of two active North American men's professional sports team located in Seattle with an overall winning record. On October 23, 2016, the Seahawks played the Arizona Cardinals at University of Phoenix Stadium and the game ended in a 6\u20136 tie after OT, which was the first time this ever happened in franchise history.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Denver_Broncos_seasons": "The Denver Broncos are an American football franchise based in Denver, Colorado. Founded by Bob Howsam on August 14, 1959, the team was one of the founder members of the American Football League (AFL), which began in 1960, before merging with the National Football League (NFL) ahead of the 1970 season, when the Broncos became part of the American Football Conference (AFC) West division; they have been in the same division ever since. As of the end of the 2019 season, Denver has completed 60 seasons (playing in over 950 combined regular season and playoff games), and has appeared in eight Super Bowls; although they lost in each of their first four Super Bowl appearances, they have since won three of them, including Super Bowl 50.\n The franchise has experienced three major periods of success. The first was from 1976 to 1981, when the Broncos did not have a losing season (a season when the team has more losses than wins), and won two AFC West division titles, and one AFC championship. The second began in 1983 and ended in 1998. During this period, the Broncos had just two losing seasons, were AFC champions five times and were Super Bowl champions for two consecutive years. This second period of success is best remembered for John Elway being the team's quarterback. The most recent run of success began in 2011, lasting until their victory in Super Bowl 50 at the end of the 2015 season. The five-year stretch was primarily spearheaded by the 2012 free agent acquisition of the then four-time League MVP former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, and included five AFC West titles, two AFC championships, as well as the Super Bowl. From their inaugural season in 1960 until 1975, they did not make either the AFL playoffs or NFL playoffs and had just two winning seasons. The Broncos were the only charter AFL franchise to never have a winning season during the AFL's 10 years of existence (although the team finished at 7\u20137 in 1962), with their first winning season not occurring until 1973, their fourth year as a member of the NFL's AFC. They also experienced their two seasons with the fewest wins ever, winning just two of 14 games in both 1963 and 1964.\n The Broncos have been AFC West champions 15 times, having won the division the last five consecutive seasons (2011 to 2015) prior to 2016, and have also earned wild card berths into the playoffs seven times, for a total of 22 playoff appearances. They have been conference champions eight times (tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and two behind the New England Patriots who have the most AFC championships) and Super Bowl champions thrice.",
  "/wiki/2015\u201316_NFL_playoffs": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2015 season began on January 9, 2016. The postseason tournament concluded with Super Bowl 50, on February 7, when the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n For this year only, the Super Bowl decided not to use a Roman numeral (\"L\") and instead used the standard numerals \"50.\" According to Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, the primary reason was that the league's graphic designers had difficulty designing a suitable, aesthetically pleasing logo with only the Roman numeral \"L\".",

  "/wiki/List_of_Carolina_Panthers_seasons": "The Carolina Panthers are a professional American football team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team was founded in 1993, when, along with the Jacksonville Jaguars, they were accepted into the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team. The Panthers are owned by David Tepper.\n The Carolina Panthers began play in 1995, and spent their first 7 seasons in the NFC West division, making it to the NFC Championship game in 1996, which was only their 2nd year as a football franchise. \n In 2002, the Panthers were moved to the NFC South after the NFL realigned their divisions due to the Houston Texans joining the league as an expansion team. Over their 20 seasons in the NFL, the Panthers have played in over 300 games, winning 6 division titles (one in the NFC West and five in the NFC South) and reaching the NFL playoffs 8 times. The Panthers have never had back-to-back winning seasons, but recorded their first back-to-back-to-back playoff seasons in 2013 and 2014, becoming the first team in the history of the NFC South to win consecutive division titles in the process. They won a third consecutive division title in 2015, finishing with a league-best 15\u20131 record and securing homefield advantage in the playoffs for the first time in team history.\n The team's worst regular season record was 2001, where they finished 1\u201315, worst in the league for that season; although they won their first game, they lost each of the remaining 15. Their best regular season record was accomplished in 2015, when they finished 15\u20131. The team has reached the Super Bowl twice; in 2003, when they lost Super Bowl XXXVIII 29\u201332 to the New England Patriots, and 2015, when they lost Super Bowl 50 10\u201324 to the Denver Broncos.

Including the playoffs, they have an overall record of 199 wins, 201 losses, and 1 tie (.498 winning percentage).",
  "/wiki/List_of_NFL_franchise_post-season_droughts": "This is a list of current National Football League (NFL) franchise post-season and Super Bowl droughts (multiple consecutive seasons of not winning). Listed here are both appearance droughts and winning droughts in almost every level of the NFL playoff system.\n As of the 2018 NFL season, every active NFL team has qualified for and won a game in the playoffs. Teams that have never made it beyond each successive milestone are listed under the year in which they began NFL play.\n Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl, four (4) are expansion franchises younger than the Super Bowl itself (Bengals, Panthers, Jaguars, and the Texans). The Falcons began playing during the season in which the Super Bowl was first played. The seven (7) other clubs (Cardinals, Lions, Oilers/Titans, Chargers, Browns, Bills, and Vikings) all won an NFL or AFL championship prior to the AFL\u2013NFL merger; in the case of the Vikings, however, the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their league title, leaving them and the Falcons as the only two teams to have existed for as long as or longer than the Super Bowl that have never secured the highest championship available to them. The longest drought since a championship of any kind is that of the Cardinals, at 72 seasons.\n Note that for continuity purposes, the Cleveland Browns are officially considered to have suspended operations for the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons. Since returning 21 years ago,  they have only made the playoffs once, while the Baltimore Ravens are considered to be a separate team that began play in 1996. The Ravens, as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, absorbed the Browns' personnel upon their suspension, but not their history."
