The relationship with the Gordon Highlanders represents the oldest officially sanctioned regimental alliance in the Commonwealth, and small unit exchanges are conducted frequently.\n A memorial was erected in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto sometime after 1912 in honour of two soldiers killed returning from a training exercise in 1912 and as a monument to the 48th Highlanders of Canada's veterans and war dead of the South African War.\n The regiment is nicknamed \"The Glamour Boys\" or \"The Four Dozen\". The name \"The Glamour Boys\" was coined by the other regiments that served with the 48th Highlanders during World War II in the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, 1st Brigade. The brigade was being inspected by King George VI but there were not enough regulation khaki puttees (leg wrappings) for all the soldiers. The 48th had to wear unofficial blue puttees. The King inquired as to why the 48th wore different puttees from the rest of the brigade. He was told that there were not enough khaki ones for all the units. The King replied that he liked the blue puttees better and that they should keep them. The 48th Highlanders continued to wear blue puttees until battledress was eventually phased out. The nickname \"Four Dozen\" is a play on The Dirty Dozen and \"48\" being equivalent to four dozen.\n The regiment provided a guard of honour for the G7 summit in 1988, a full royal honour guard for Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 as well as the Royal Winter Fair, annually. The Regimental Colour Party has marched in events as far afield as Prince Edward Island and the United States, and remains in great demand as a living example of the pageantry and gallantry of the Highland regimental tradition.\n The regiment's Military Band and the Pipes and Drums have played at every Toronto Maple Leafs home opening game at both Maple Leaf Gardens and the Air Canada Centre. The bands were requested by Conn Smythe, who had been a major in the First World War, to play at the opening of the new Maple Leaf Gardens on November 12, 1931.\n The regiment's motto is dileas gu brath, which is Gaelic for \"faithful forever\".
