  "/wiki/Armaniidae": "Armaniidae was sometimes treated as the most basal of the Formicidae subfamilies, and classed as a stem-group which is more distant in relation to modern ants than the next stem group, Sphecomyrminae.  More often the group, treated as \"ant-like wasps\", was elevated to the rank of family, and considered as a possible sister group to Formicidae. It has been suggested by Engel and Grimaldi that the group may be paraphyletic.  This position is in contrast to the original hypothesis of Russian paleoentomologist Gennady Dlussky, who first described the family.  Dlussky considered the group, when erected in 1983, have been an intermediate family bridging the families Scoliidae and the true formicids.  In contrast to both the treatment as a separate family and as a distinct subfamily, entomologist E. O. Wilson, in a 1987 paper, suggested that the then known armaniids and Sphecomyrma represented a single species.  Wilson, in synonymizing the groups, made the hypothesis that the different described genera were actually fossils of different castes of the same species, with Sphecomyrma freyi being workers, Armania robusta being queens, and \"Paleomyrmex\" zherichini as the winged males.  This view was rejected as new fossils and species were described.",
