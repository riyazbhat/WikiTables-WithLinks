The long-lived storm began developing in the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France on January 5. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and R\u00e9union to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $450,000 in monetary donations.",

Tropical activity lasted for about six months from the middle of November 1995 to early May 1996. The first storm, Intense Tropical Cyclone Agnielle, formed in the adjacent Australian basin on November\u00a016 and later reached peak winds in the south-west Indian Ocean. The next named storm after Agnielle was Bonita, which formed in early January and killed 42\u00a0people. The basin was most active in February, with two tropical cyclones, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, as well as a severe tropical storm. The first of these three was Doloresse, which killed 67\u00a0people due to a shipwreck in the Comoros. The next storm was Cyclone Edwige, which caused heavy crop damage on Mauritius before looping along the east coast of Madagascar. In March, both Cyclone Flossy and Tropical Storm Guylianne passed near the Mascarene Islands, producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds.",

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Hudah": "Cyclone Hudah was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Southeast Africa in April\u00a02000. It was the last in a series of three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March\u00a022, within the Australian region cyclone basin. Moving westward as the result of a strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category\u00a02 cyclone intensity on March\u00a025 before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin. For various reasons that remain unknown, the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in R\u00e9union. Nonetheless, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone. An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on March\u00a027 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. On April\u00a01, the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1\u00a0minute winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on April\u00a02. It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical cyclone status on April\u00a05 after moving over the Mozambique Channel. Hudah reached 10\u00a0minute winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on April\u00a08, and dissipated by the next day.",

The most notable storm of the season was Eline, which was the third longest-lasting storm on record in the basin. It lasted for 29\u00a0days while traversing the southern Indian Ocean, making the strongest landfall in decades along eastern Madagascar in late February. The storm was the first in a series of three storms that struck the country in early 2000, along with Gloria in March and Hudah in April. Collectively, the three storms killed at least 316\u00a0people.

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Dina": "Intense Tropical Cyclone Dina was a cyclone that caused record flooding across parts of R\u00e9union. Originating from a tropical disturbance on 15 January 2002 near the Chagos Archipelago, the precursor to Dina quickly developed within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis. By January\u00a017, the system had developed enough organized convection as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) on January\u00a018. Dina achieved its peak intensity on January\u00a020 as an intense tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph). Hours after reaching hits strength, the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) to its north. On January\u00a021, the storm brushed Mauritius and R\u00e9union as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January\u00a025.

With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on March\u00a07, developing an eye and well-defined outflow. After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar. Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) on March\u00a010 just offshore eastern Madagascar, which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000.",

The season began early when an unnamed tropical storm struck Seychelles in September, becoming the most damaging storm there in 50\u00a0years. The next system, Atang, was the first named storm of the season, but was only a tropical depression; it was named due to the threat to an outer island of Mauritius. Atang later struck Tanzania in a climatologically unusual area in November, resulting in unconfirmed deaths of fishermen. The first named storm to reach tropical storm intensity was Boura, which brushed the Mascarene Islands with gusty winds and rainfall. In December, Cyclone Crystal threatened to strike Mauritius but instead veered eastward, and later, Tropical Storm Delfina lasted from late December through early January 2003.

Hellen formed on March\u00a026 in the northern portion of the channel, and the storm brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique while in its formative stages. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center of circulation. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March\u00a030, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in La R\u00e9union. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and land interaction with Madagascar, and the storm's eye dissipated. On March\u00a031, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water. By April\u00a01, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping, later dissipating on April\u00a05."
