  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales, according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in. Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones, but some alternative scales also exist, such as accumulated cyclone energy, the Power Dissipation Index, the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index, and the Hurricane Severity Index.\n Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales. Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms. Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane, then it will be classified on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period. In the Western Pacific, the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin, which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period.\n The India Meteorological Department's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean, and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds. Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales, which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds: The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin. The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories, including New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft). However, the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) above the surface. The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.\n Within all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds reach at least 35\u00a0kn (40\u00a0mph; 65\u00a0km/h).",
  "/wiki/1981\u201382_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 1981\u201382 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was destructive and deadly in Madagascar, where four cyclones killed 100\u00a0people and caused $250\u00a0million (USD) in damage. The season was fairly active, lasting from October to May. There were nine named storms that attained gale-force winds, or at least 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, which have 10\u00a0minute sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).\n The first storm was Tropical Cyclone Alex, which was named by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). this was due to the boundary of the basin at the time, which incorporated the Indian Ocean south of the equator and extended from the east coast of Africa to 80\u00b0\u00a0E; the eastern extent was later moved to 90\u00b0\u00a0E. Two other storms \u2013 Armelle and Damia \u2013 also originated in the Australian basin. The latter was the strongest cyclone on record in the basin at the time by barometric pressure, estimated at 898\u00a0mbar (26.5\u00a0inHg). The first storm to affect Madagascar was Benedicte in December, and was followed by tropical storms Frida and Electre in February and Justine in March. The final storm of the season was Cyclone Karla, which remained in the eastern periphery of the basin while reaching winds of 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph).",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Geralda": "Cyclone Geralda (also known as Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. It originated from an area of low pressure over the Indian Ocean on January\u00a025. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February\u00a05, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.\n Geralda was the second cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. Geralda produced wind gusts as strong as 350\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph), which were the highest worldwide for several decades. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly in valleys. About 80% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed, including most schools, homes, and churches. The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43\u00a0people after flooding many houses. Overall, more than 40,000\u00a0homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000\u00a0people homeless. Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231\u00a0people and caused over $10\u00a0million in damage (1994\u00a0USD).[nb 1] Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by lack of coordination, and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country.",

Activity lasted from mid-November, when Moderate Tropical Storm Alexina formed, until mid-April, when Tropical Cyclone Odille became extratropical. Four tropical cyclones \u2013 Daisy, Geralda, Litanne, and Nadia \u2013 struck eastern Madagascar, of which Geralda was the costliest and deadliest. With gusts as strong as 350\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph) accompanied by heavy rainfall, Geralda destroyed more than 40,000\u00a0homes and left 356,000\u00a0people homeless. Geralda killed 231\u00a0people and caused more than $10\u00a0million in damage.[nb 1] Cyclone Nadia was the second deadliest cyclone, having killed 12\u00a0people in northern Madagascar and later severely damaging portions of northeastern Mozambique, killing about 240\u00a0people and leaving $20\u00a0million in damage in the latter country. In February, Cyclone Hollanda struck Mauritius near peak intensity, causing $135\u00a0million in damage and two deaths.\n Three storms \u2013 Alexina, Bettina, and Cecilia \u2013 formed in late 1993, of which Cecilia affected land; it produced heavy rainfall in R\u00e9union while dissipating. Cyclone Daisy was the first storm in 1994, which struck Madagascar twice and affected many areas that were later struck by Geralda. One cyclone \u2013 Farah \u2013 previously formed in the Australian basin as Tropical Cyclone Pearl before crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean. Tropical Cyclone Ivy threatened Mauritius just days after Hollanda struck, and Intense Tropical Cyclone Litanne in March was the third of the season to hit northeastern Madagascar. The basin is defined as the area west of 90\u00b0E and south of the Equator in the Indian Ocean, which includes the waters around Madagascar westward to the east coast of Africa. Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in R\u00e9union (MFR),[nb 2] as well as by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).[nb 3]",
  "/wiki/1994\u201395_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 1994\u201395 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was fairly active, with storms forming regularly from October through April. It was much less damaging than its predecessor, and most of the storms in the season remained over water or only brushed land. The first system was Tropical Depression A1, which formed in October and passed north of Madagascar. The first named storm was Albertine, which formed on November\u00a023 in the northeastern portion of the basin and became one of three intense tropical cyclones. The last storm was Marlene, which was also an intense tropical cyclone and dissipated on April\u00a011.\n Most of the storms originated from the intertropical convergence zone. In late December into early January, tropical storms Bentha and Christelle persisted to the east of Madagascar, undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with each other. Later in January, Dorina became the second of three intense tropical cyclones, but weakened before passing near Rodrigues. Tropical Depression Eliceca and Tropical Storm Fodah both formed in the Mozambique Channel toward the end of January, bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the region. In February, Gail produced gusty winds on Rodrigues, and Tropical Storm Heida entered the basin from Australian region. Later in the month, Ingrid brought strong winds to Mauritius. Tropical storms Josta and Kylie developed toward the beginning of March from the same overall system, affecting Madagascar and R\u00e9union, respectively. After they dissipated, Tropical Depression Lidy caused flooding and damage on Rodrigues due to heavy rainfall.",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Bonita": "Cyclone Bonita in January 1996 struck both Madagascar and Mozambique, causing severe damage. The long-lived storm began developing in the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France on January 5. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and R\u00e9union to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $450,000 in monetary donations.\n Bonita emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a significantly diminished storm, though it quickly regained some of its previous intensity. Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zamibia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean.",
  "/wiki/1995\u201396_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 1995\u201396 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a moderately active season that included Cyclone Bonita, which was the first known tropical cyclone to cross from the southern Indian Ocean into the southern Atlantic Ocean. Tropical activity lasted for about six months from the middle of November 1995 to early May 1996. The first storm, Intense Tropical Cyclone Agnielle, formed in the adjacent Australian basin on November\u00a016 and later reached peak winds in the south-west Indian Ocean. The next named storm after Agnielle was Bonita, which formed in early January and killed 42\u00a0people. The basin was most active in February, with two tropical cyclones, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, as well as a severe tropical storm. The first of these three was Doloresse, which killed 67\u00a0people due to a shipwreck in the Comoros. The next storm was Cyclone Edwige, which caused heavy crop damage on Mauritius before looping along the east coast of Madagascar. In March, both Cyclone Flossy and Tropical Storm Guylianne passed near the Mascarene Islands, producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds.\n Tropical activity continued through April and May, with two tropical cyclones in the former month. In early April, Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues, dropping more rainfall in 24\u00a0hours than the average monthly total. Later, Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone, but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island. The final storm of the season, Jenna, formed in the Australian region, briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean, and proceeded to exit the basin on May\u00a04 to end the season. In addition to the named storms, several tropical depressions were tracked, one of which in December dropped heavy rainfall on R\u00e9union.",

Most activity was from November through February. According to the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office (MFR) at R\u00e9union, there were 21 tropical disturbances, 14 of which intensified into tropical depressions. There were 12\u00a0named storms, beginning with Antoinette and proceeding sequentially until Lisette. In addition, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also warned on storms in the region, which identified five other tropical storms. Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, or with 10\u2013minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph); of these, three strengthened further into intense tropical cyclones, with Daniella and Helinda tied for strongest storm of the season.\n In August, a tropical depression developed in the south-west Indian Ocean for the first time 27\u00a0years, and a month later, a rare September tropical disturbance formed. The first named storm, Antoinette, was the first of several to originate in the neighboring Australian basin, or east of 90\u00b0\u00a0E; the subsequent two named storms also formed in the Australian region. In early December, Cyclone Daniella likely developed out of the remnants of previous Tropical Storm Chantelle. After reaching peak 10\u2013minute winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), Daniella weakened and passed just southwest of Mauritius; there, the storm left heavy crop damage and indirectly caused three deaths. In early January, Tropical Storm Fabriola was the first in a succession of three storms to move over Madagascar. The next \u2013 Cyclone Gretelle \u2013 killed 152\u00a0people when it struck southeastern Madagascar. Between January and February, Cyclone Pancho-Helinda lasted about 20\u00a0days between both the Australian and south-west Indian basins. Also in February, Tropical Storm Josie killed 36\u00a0people in western Madagascar after causing severe flooding. The final named storm was Tropical Storm Lisette, which dissipated on March\u00a03 after striking Mozambique, killing three people. Despite the early end to the named storms, there were two additional disturbances, one of which became the first July tropical depression in 25\u00a0years.",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Hudah": "Cyclone Hudah was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Southeast Africa in April\u00a02000. It was the last in a series of three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March\u00a022, within the Australian region cyclone basin. Moving westward as the result of a strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category\u00a02 cyclone intensity on March\u00a025 before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin. For various reasons that remain unknown, the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in R\u00e9union. Nonetheless, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone. An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on March\u00a027 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. On April\u00a01, the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1\u00a0minute winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph). Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on April\u00a02. It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical cyclone status on April\u00a05 after moving over the Mozambique Channel. Hudah reached 10\u00a0minute winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on April\u00a08, and dissipated by the next day.\n While in the vicinity, Hudah brought moderate winds to Rodrigues, St. Brandon, and Tromelin Island. The cyclone affected the same parts of Madagascar that were previously impacted by cyclones Eline and Gloria. Waves reached at least 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in height along the coast. The storm was considered the worst to affect the Antalaha region in 20\u00a0years, where 90% of homes were destroyed. It was estimated that the storm left at least 100,000\u00a0people homeless in Madagascar, and there were 111\u00a0deaths. In Mozambique, damage was much less than expected, and the storm affected areas farther north in the country than where Eline struck. Heavy rainfall occurred along the coast, but was insufficient to cause river flooding. Strong winds damaged roofs and downed trees, mostly around Pebane, and the storm killed three people.",
  "/wiki/1999\u20132000_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 1999\u20132000 South-West Indian Ocean tropical cyclone season was the first on record in which two storms \u2013 Leon\u2013Eline and Hudah \u2013 struck Mozambique at tropical cyclone intensity, or with maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). The most notable storm of the season was Eline, which was the third longest-lasting storm on record in the basin. It lasted for 29\u00a0days while traversing the southern Indian Ocean, making the strongest landfall in decades along eastern Madagascar in late February. The storm was the first in a series of three storms that struck the country in early 2000, along with Gloria in March and Hudah in April. Collectively, the three storms killed at least 316\u00a0people. The season started on November\u00a01, 1999, and ended for most of the basin on April\u00a030, 2000; for Mauritius and the Seychelles, the season continued until May\u00a015. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin;\n Despite the destructive nature of the season, it began later than usual. Cyclone Astride originated toward the end of December, bringing rainfall and gusty winds to northern Madagascar while in the region. In January, Cyclones Babiola and Connie both formed east of Madagascar and took southerly tracks. Connie passed near R\u00e9union island, producing 1,752\u00a0mm (69.0\u00a0in) of rainfall in the mountainous peaks and killing two people. Eline, the longest lasting storm of the season, struck Mozambique while the country was experiencing its worst flooding in 50\u00a0years, collectively causing around 700\u00a0deaths and about $500\u00a0million in damage. The storm also killed 12\u00a0people in Zimbabwe and 21 in South Africa. Just two weeks after Eline struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Gloria affected the same general region, bringing additional deaths and damage. Cyclone Hudah in April was the strongest storm of the season, reaching peak 10\u2011minute winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). It caused three deaths in Mozambique, although its effects were worse in Madagascar, where there were 111\u00a0deaths. The final storm of the season was Tropical Storm Innocente, which dissipated on April\u00a024. In addition to the named storms, there were four unnamed tropical disturbances or storms, as well as one subtropical cyclone that formed in the southern Mozambique Channel.",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Dina": "Intense Tropical Cyclone Dina was a cyclone that caused record flooding across parts of R\u00e9union. Originating from a tropical disturbance on 15 January 2002 near the Chagos Archipelago, the precursor to Dina quickly developed within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis. By January\u00a017, the system had developed enough organized convection as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) on January\u00a018. Dina achieved its peak intensity on January\u00a020 as an intense tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph). Hours after reaching hits strength, the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) to its north. On January\u00a021, the storm brushed Mauritius and R\u00e9union as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January\u00a025. The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were last noted on January\u00a028 before being absorbed into a polar trough.\n Across Mauritius and R\u00e9union, torrential rains and destructive winds from the cyclone resulted in extensive to \"catastrophic\" damage. The entire island of Mauritius lost power during the storm and widespread structural damage took place. Agricultural and property damage amounted to US$47\u00a0million and US$50\u00a0million respectively in the republic. Nine fatalities were attributed to the storm in Mauritius: five off the coast of Rodrigues Island and four on the main island. More extensive damage was seen on R\u00e9union where up to 2,102\u00a0mm (82.8\u00a0in) of rain fell over three days. Record to near-record flooding destroyed many homes, washed out roads, and caused catastrophic agricultural damage. Destructive winds, measured up to 280\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) also crippled communications. In all, six people died on the island and losses were estimated at \u20ac200\u00a0million (US$190\u00a0million).",

Many storms formed in the north-east portion of the basin, and several more originated around Australia. The basin is defined as the waters of the Indian Ocean west of longitude 90\u00b0E to the coast of Africa and south of the equator. Eleven tropical storms formed, compared to an average of nine. Tropical systems were present during 73\u00a0days, which was significantly higher than the average of 58 for this basin.\n Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in R\u00e9union. The season started on November\u00a01, 2001, and ended on April\u00a030, 2002; for Mauritius and the Seychelles, the season continued until May\u00a015. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin; however, storms formed both before and after the designated season. The first storm was Andre, which emerged from the Australian basin as Tropical Cyclone Alex in late October. The strongest storm, Cyclone Hary, was the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000; it hit Madagascar, where it caused lighter damage than expected but three deaths. In January, Cyclone Dina left heavy damage in the Mascarene Islands, particularly on R\u00e9union, where it dropped 2,102\u00a0mm (82.8\u00a0in) of rainfall.

Developing on March\u00a05 from the monsoon trough, the storm initially moved generally to the west and gradually intensified. With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on March\u00a07, developing an eye and well-defined outflow. After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar. Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) on March\u00a010 just offshore eastern Madagascar, which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000.\n After peaking, Hary weakened due to land interaction, and it struck Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. It was turning south over land, and as a result it quickly moved offshore. There were three deaths in the country, one of which from electrocution. There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over R\u00e9union. On the mountain peaks of the island, rainfall reached 1,344\u00a0mm (52.9\u00a0in), although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000\u00a0people were left without power. Hary became extratropical on March\u00a013, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm.",

The eleventh named storm and sixth cyclone of the season, Kalunde formed on March\u00a04 from an area of disturbed weather east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The storm steadily strengthened and attained severe tropical storm intensity on March\u00a06. After starting a phase of rapid deepening, Kalunde attained cyclone intensity the next day. Kalunde attained its peak intensity on March 8, as an intense tropical cyclone. It maintained its peak strength for a day; shortly thereafter, the system began to weaken. After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, the storm brushed Rodrigues. Shortly after doing so, Kalunde weakened into a tropical cyclone and later a severe tropical storm. Two days later, on March\u00a016, the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day.\n Cyclone Kalunde brought US$3.15\u00a0million in damage to Rodrigues Island. A total of 1,600\u00a0homes and 40\u00a0boats were damaged. Severe coastal damage took place across the island; many roads were washed out. Power outages also occurred across the island, delaying residents access to information pertaining to Kalunde.

Storms during the season impacted the Mascarene Islands, Seychelles, Madagascar, and countries in southeastern Africa. The season began early when an unnamed tropical storm struck Seychelles in September, becoming the most damaging storm there in 50\u00a0years. The next system, Atang, was the first named storm of the season, but was only a tropical depression; it was named due to the threat to an outer island of Mauritius. Atang later struck Tanzania in a climatologically unusual area in November, resulting in unconfirmed deaths of fishermen. The first named storm to reach tropical storm intensity was Boura, which brushed the Mascarene Islands with gusty winds and rainfall. In December, Cyclone Crystal threatened to strike Mauritius but instead veered eastward, and later, Tropical Storm Delfina lasted from late December through early January 2003. Delfina damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Mozambique and Malawi, killing 54\u00a0people.\n In January 2003, Severe Tropical Storm Ebula continued the steady activity, forming in the eastern portion of the basin. Later, Tropical Storm Fari crossed southern Madagascar with heavy rains, causing flooding and mudslides that left 3,400\u00a0people homeless. In February, there were four simultaneous tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean, three of which in the basin. Cyclone Gerry formed first and the farthest west, passing just east of Mauritius and killing one person there. Cyclone Hape formed shortly thereafter, and Tropical Storm Isha formed farther east, having originated from the Australian basin. Cyclone Japhet struck southern Mozambique and produced widespread flooding in southeastern Africa, killing 25\u00a0people. In March, Cyclone Kalunde was the strongest storm of the season, reaching 10-minute sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (135\u00a0mph). It struck Rodrigues while weakening, damaging 1,600\u00a0houses and causing an island-wide power outage. About a month later, a subtropical cyclone named Luma intensified southeast of Madagascar and developed an eye.

Being unusually large and intense, Gafilo was the deadliest and most destructive cyclone of the 2003\u201304 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. According to the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, Gafilo killed at least 363 people. Gafilo also caused about $250 million (2004 USD) damages in Madagascar, which makes it one of most devastating storms to hit the country on reliable record.\n Forming south of Diego Garcia, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm on 3 March. One day later, Gafilo became a tropical cyclone, and it ultimately intensified into a very intense tropical cyclone on 6 March, prior to making landfall over Madagascar early on the next day. After crossing the island, Gafilo emerged into the Mozambique Channel and made landfall over Madagascar again on 9 March. After a three-day loop overland, the system arrived at the Indian Ocean on 13 March, and it transitioned into a subtropical depression on 14 March. Gafilo then became extratropical on the next day and weakened, before dissipating on 18 March.",
  "/wiki/2003\u201304_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 2003\u201304 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season featured the most intense tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean, Cyclone Gafilo, as well as nine other named storms. Tropical activity began on September\u00a028 when Moderate Tropical Storm Abaimba formed at a low latitude. Activity continued until late May, following Severe Tropical Storm Juba, which marked the third year in a row that a storm formed in May. The final disturbance, one of sixteen, dissipated on May\u00a024. Activity was near average, and the season was one of the longest on record.\n The first intense tropical cyclone was Beni, which reached that intensity on November\u00a013, the third-earliest on record. In December, Tropical Cyclone Cela moved across Madagascar, and Severe Tropical Storm Darius dropped heavy rainfall in the Mascarene Islands. In January, Cyclone Elita crossed Madagascar three times, which caused widespread flooding and 33\u00a0deaths. Also in that month was Intense Tropical Cyclone Frank, which developed quickly but remained away from land. On March\u00a07, Cyclone Gafilo struck near Antalaha in northeast Madagascar and largely destroyed the town. Across the country, the storm destroyed over 20,000\u00a0homes, leaving 304,000\u00a0people homeless. Nationwide, the storm killed 363\u00a0people and left $250\u00a0million in damage (2004\u00a0USD). Later in March, two storms \u2013 Nicky and Oscar \u2013 crossed 90\u00b0 E from the Australian basin and were renamed Helma and Itseng, respectively. Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in R\u00e9union.",
  "/wiki/2004\u201305_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 2004\u201305 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a near average season, despite beginning unusually early on August\u00a030 with the formation of an early-season tropical depression. M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France's meteorological office in R\u00e9union (MFR) ultimately monitored 18\u00a0tropical disturbances during the season, of which 15 became tropical depressions. Two storms \u2013 Arola and Bento \u2013 formed in November, and the latter became the most intense November cyclone on record. Bento attained its peak intensity at a low latitude, and weakened before threatening land. Tropical Cyclone Chambo was the only named storm in December. In January, Severe Tropical Storm Daren and Cyclone Ernest existed simultaneously. The latter storm struck southern Madagascar, and five days later, Moderate Tropical Storm Felapi affected the same area; the two storms killed 78\u00a0people and left over 32,000\u00a0people homeless. At the end of January, Severe Tropical Storm Gerard existed as an unnamed tropical storm for 18\u00a0hours due to discrepancies between warning centers.\n After a series of weak tropical systems in February, there were two storms in March. Severe Tropical Storm Hennie brought heavy rainfall to the Mascarene Islands, and Severe Tropical Storm Isang remained away from land. The season's strongest storm originated in the neighboring Australian basin, developing in early April near the Cocos Islands. After being named Adeline by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), the MFR renamed the storm Juliet once the storm crossed 90\u00b0E. Juliet would reach maximum sustained winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), making it a very intense tropical cyclone. Juliet damaged corn plantations on the island of Rodrigues before becoming an extratropical cyclone on April\u00a011, thus ending the season.",
  "/wiki/2005\u201306_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 2005\u201306 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was the fifth least-active on record. The M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office on the island of R\u00e9union tracked 13\u00a0tropical disturbances, of which six intensified into a moderate tropical storm. Three of these systems proceeded to attain tropical cyclone status \u2013 reaching 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center also tracked eight storms in the basin. Activity was below normal due to a powerful Walker circulation, which increased convection over the neighboring Australian basin, but suppressed activity in the western Indian Ocean. As a result, most of the storms developed near or entered from the Australian basin, crossing 90\u00b0E to enter the South-West Indian Ocean.\n A series of four short-lived systems occurred from September to November in the northeastern portion of the basin. These were followed by the first named storm \u2013 Alvin \u2013 which was renamed after it crossed from the Australian region as Tropical Cyclone Bertie in late November. After another short-lived disturbance in late December, there was a tropical disturbance in the Mozambique Channel in January that killed 26\u00a0people when it brought heavy rainfall to Mozambique. Later in the month, Tropical Cyclone Boloetse took an erratic track across Madagascar, killing six people when it brushed the island's southwest coast. In February, there was a small, short-lived unnamed tropical storm that presented difficulties to warning agencies in determining its structure. Intense Tropical Cyclone Carina was the strongest system of the season, attaining peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph) in the open waters of the eastern portion of the basin. Sprawling Tropical Storm Diwa brought six months' worth of rainfall to the drought-ridden island of R\u00e9union, reaching 2,943\u00a0mm (115.9\u00a0in) in the mountainous peaks. The rains led to flooding and landslides that killed 10\u00a0people directly or indirectly. Two of the deaths occurred when a saturated cliff collapsed onto a coastal road. The final storm, Elia, dissipated on April\u00a017 after previously entering from the Australian basin.",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Hondo": "Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was the strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during the 2007\u201308 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020\u00a0km (635\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February\u00a04 and a severe tropical storm the following day. After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph 10-minute winds) on February\u00a07. The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures. On February\u00a012, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area. Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development. On February\u00a020, about 2,780\u00a0km (1,725\u00a0mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate. The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression. However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 1-minute winds) before passing directly over R\u00e9union. Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more. The storm dissipated on February\u00a029 after executing a counterclockwise loop.",

It began on November 15, 2007, and ended on April 30, 2008, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, which ended May 15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90\u00b0E and south of the Equator.

In this basin which officially runs from 30 to 90E and is to the south of the equator, the main warning center is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on La Reunion Island; however they delegate the naming of Cyclones to the Meteorological services of Mauritius and Madagascar.\n It was predicted by the Mauritius Meteorological service that there would be between nine and eleven named storms in the South West Indian Ocean during the season. Their further assessment that there was a good probability of a named storm forming in November was justified when Tropical Cyclone Anja formed on November 14.",
  "/wiki/2013\u201314_South-West_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season": "The 2013\u201314 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was an above average event in tropical cyclone formation. The season officially began on July\u00a01, 2013, though the first tropical system designated by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France was a short-lived tropical disturbance that developed on July\u00a08. However, the first named storm was Cyclone Amara in December. Bruce was the first very intense tropical cyclone since Edzani in 2010, which originated from the Australian region. The strongest system of the cyclone season was Hellen, also one of the most intense tropical cyclones over the Mozambique Channel. The season officially ended on June\u00a030, 2014\n Within this basin, tropical and subtropical disturbances are officially monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre on R\u00e9union island, while the Mauritius and Madagascar weather services assign names to significant tropical and subtropical disturbances.",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Hellen": "Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hellen of March 2014 was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones in the Mozambique Channel on record, as well as the most intense of the 2013\u201314 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Hellen formed on March\u00a026 in the northern portion of the channel, and the storm brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique while in its formative stages. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center of circulation. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March\u00a030, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in La R\u00e9union. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and land interaction with Madagascar, and the storm's eye dissipated. On March\u00a031, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water. By April\u00a01, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping, later dissipating on April\u00a05.\n Early in its existence, Hellen's rainfall in Mozambique destroyed hundreds of houses and a bridge. Flooding killed four people in the country, three of whom due to a home  collapsing. Later, the cyclone passed south of the Comoros islands, causing flooding due to high storm surge and waves that killed one person. The storm forced 8,956\u00a0people to evacuate their homes due to the threat for landslides, while 901\u00a0houses were damaged or destroyed. On nearby Mayotte, high rainfall flooded rivers, sweeping one car away. In northwestern Madagascar, Hellen damaged or destroyed 611\u00a0houses, leaving 1,736\u00a0people homeless. The storm killed three people after capsizing a boat.",
  "/wiki/List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones": "Winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds. However, variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult. In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damages, and tornadoes can vary significantly in storms with similar wind speeds. Pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because the measurements are easier and use consistent methodology. Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth. However, although there is a strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds, storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds, as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.\n In the most recent and reliable records, most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (mbar) (26.56\u00a0inHg) or less have occurred in the Western North Pacific Ocean. The strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central pressure, was Typhoon Tip, which reached a pressure of 870\u00a0hPa (25.69\u00a0inHg) on October 12, 1979. The following list is subdivided by basins. Data listed are provided by the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre, unless otherwise noted. On October 23, 2015, Hurricane Patricia attained the strongest 1-minute sustained winds on record at 215\u00a0mph (345\u00a0km/h)."
