  "/wiki/NY_17": "New York State Route 17 (NY 17) is a major state highway that extends for 397 miles (638.91 km) through the Southern Tier and Downstate regions of New York in the United States. It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and follows the Southern Tier Expressway east through Corning to Binghamton and the Quickway from Binghamton east to Woodbury, where it turns south to follow the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern, where it connects to  New Jersey Route 17. From the Pennsylvania border to the village of Waverly and from Binghamton to Windsor, NY 17 is concurrent with Interstate 86 (I-86). Eventually, the entire east\u2013west portion of NY 17 from the Pennsylvania border to Woodbury will become I-86 as projects to upgrade the route to Interstate Highway standards are completed.\n At 397 miles, NY 17 is the longest state route in New York, and its second-longest highway of any kind besides the Thruway. It serves 11 counties (Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Allegany, Steuben, Chemung, Tioga, Broome, Delaware, Sullivan, Orange, and Rockland), passes through the cities of Salamanca, Olean, Corning, Elmira, and Binghamton, and enters the vicinity of several others, including Jamestown and Middletown. As it proceeds across the state, it intersects many of New York's Interstate and U.S. Highways, including U.S. Route 219 (US 219) in Salamanca, I-99 and US 15 near Corning, I-81 in Binghamton, and I-84 near Middletown. The portion of NY 17 in the vicinity of Waverly is actually located in Pennsylvania; however, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).\n The route was assigned in 1924, extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways. It was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1980s. Two of NY 17's suffixed routes, NY 17C and NY 17M, follow substantial portions of NY 17's pre-freeway alignment. In 1998, all of NY 17 between the Pennsylvania state line and Harriman was designated as \"Future I-86\". The westernmost 177 miles (285 km) of the route was designated as I-86 one year later, and the designation has been gradually extended eastward as sections of NY 17 were improved to Interstate Highway standards. Prior to the I-86 designation, NY 17 was part of a 3-state Route 17 along with New Jersey Route 17 and the former Pennsylvania Route 17 (PA 17).",

  "/wiki/NY_206": "New York State Route 206 (NY 206) is a 74.57-mile-long (120.01 km) state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States. It runs through some lightly populated regions along the state's southern border, from Central New York to the Catskills. It begins near a busy intersection with Interstate 81 (I-81) at Whitney Point and runs east from there through Greene. The eastern terminus is located at a junction with NY 17 (future I-86) at Roscoe in Sullivan County. It is one of the longest three-digit routes in New York, and the only long one not associated with a two-digit route or a former U.S. Route. Yet due to its location it sees little traffic, although for much of its length it follows the route of a main 19th century thoroughfare, the Catskill Turnpike. It is primarily a long shortcut around Binghamton.\n NY 206 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but only from Bainbridge to Downsville. NY 206 was extended west to Whitney Point in the early 1940s; another extension in the late 1970s moved the route's eastern terminus to Roscoe. Prior to becoming NY 206, the Whitney Point\u2013Greene segment was once New York State Route 219 and New York State Route 383 while the portion from Coventry to Bainbridge was previously New York State Route 218.",

  "/wiki/List_of_county_routes_in_Sullivan_County,_New_York": "County routes in Sullivan County, New York, are maintained by the Sullivan County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon route marker. The county highway system comprises roughly 140 routes arranged across the county in groups of nine. For the most part, state routes in Sullivan County are county-maintained and co-signed with county routes. However, the converse is not true; that is, not all county routes overlap state routes for their entire length. Typically, each series consists of county routes along a single roadway, often overlapping with state highways in the process. The lowest numbered route in the system is County Route 11 (CR 11); the highest is CR 183C. Note that routes 160 through 169 do not conform to any style, and coincidentally the 170 through 179 series (with the exception of the spur designated 174A) follows the pre-expressway routing of New York State Route 17 (NY 17).\n Sullivan County posted signage of their routes in 1958."
