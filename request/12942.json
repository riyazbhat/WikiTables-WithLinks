Citizens band is distinct from other personal radio service allocations such as FRS, GMRS, MURS, UHF CB and the Amateur Radio Service (\"ham\" radio). In many countries, CB operation does not require a license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other land mobile radio services, multiple radios in a local area share a single frequency channel, but only one can transmit at a time. The radio is normally in receive mode to receive transmissions of other radios on the channel; when a user wants to talk they press a \"push to talk\" button on their radio, which turns on their transmitter. Users on a channel must take turns talking. Transmitter power is limited to 4\u00a0watts in the US and the EU.
