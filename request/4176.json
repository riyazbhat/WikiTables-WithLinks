It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).",

  "/wiki/Atomic_weapons": "A nuclear weapon (also called an atom bomb, nuke, atomic bomb, nuclear warhead, A-bomb, or nuclear bomb) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\"atomic\") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84\u00a0TJ). The first thermonuclear (\"hydrogen\") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10\u00a0million tons of TNT (42\u00a0PJ). A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds (1,100\u00a0kg) can release energy equal to more than 1.2\u00a0million tons of TNT (5.0\u00a0PJ).

The amount and spread of fallout is a product of the size of the weapon and the altitude at which it is detonated. Fallout may get entrained with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black rain (rain darkened by soot and other particulates, which fell within 30\u201340 minutes of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki).
