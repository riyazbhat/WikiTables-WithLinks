A. C. Green, the only player left from the Lakers' Showtime era, was in the Lakers starting lineup for this series as well.\n For the Pacers, it was their first Eastern Conference title after four previous appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals; however, after this season, the team was radically altered with key players Dale Davis, Derrick McKey and Mark Jackson moving to other teams and Rik Smits retiring.

  "/wiki/List_of_New_Orleans_Pelicans_seasons": "The New Orleans Pelicans are a professional basketball team based in New Orleans, Louisiana.  They are members of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The franchise began play during the 2002\u201303 NBA season as the New Orleans Hornets following the relocation of the Charlotte Hornets, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. After three seasons in New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina forced the franchise to temporarily relocate to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where they spent two seasons as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets.  The Hornets returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007\u201308 season.  The team changed its name to the New Orleans Pelicans at the conclusion of the 2012\u201313 season.\n Led by All-Star Baron Davis, the New Orleans Hornets qualified for their first post-season appearance during the 2002\u201303 season. They lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round.  The team earned their first division title during the 2007\u201308 season, behind the play of All-Stars Chris Paul and David West. Finishing with a franchise-best record of 56 wins and 26 losses, the Hornets won the Southwest Division title over the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. They advanced to the Conference Semifinals, where they were defeated by the Spurs in seven games.\n In 16 seasons, the Pelicans have compiled an overall record of 630\u2013715 all-time. They have qualified the playoffs seven times, winning two series, and posted seven seasons of 41 wins or more.",
  "/wiki/2008_NBA_Playoffs": "The 2008 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2007\u201308 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Paul Pierce was named NBA Finals MVP.\n The playoffs were noted for the Atlanta Hawks' return after 9 years, taking the #1 seed and eventual champion Celtics to 7 games before bowing out. Also notable was the debut of the Chris Paul-led Hornets in the playoffs after Hurricane Katrina and their 7-game series against defending champions San Antonio Spurs, and the Lakers and Celtics' revitalization of their franchises, most especially after key trades during the preseason and regular season. The Celtics ended up playing 26 playoff games (2 games short of a full length postseason of 28), breaking the 25 game record of the 1994 Knicks and 2005 Pistons by 1 game for the most playoff games in a single season played by 1 NBA team. The Knicks, however, only played a Best-of-5 First Round, and so had 2 fewer games to accomplish that feat. Also, the top seeds from each Conference met in the NBA Finals for the first time since 2000. The 2008 Finals was also the first since 1998 to feature neither Shaquille O'Neal nor Tim Duncan.\n The Golden State Warriors won 48 games, more than 5 of the 8 playoff teams in the Eastern Conference. However, all eight qualifiers in the Western Conference finished with at least 50 wins, thus leaving the Warriors out of the postseason.",
  "/wiki/List_of_Charlotte_Hornets_seasons": "The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball club based in Charlotte, North Carolina. They are members of the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The original Charlotte Hornets franchise played in Charlotte from 1988\u20132002 before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana and becoming the New Orleans Hornets. A new franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, began play in the 2004\u201305 season. The team played for ten seasons as the Bobcats before adopting the Hornets name again starting in the 2014\u201315 season.  The Hornets name was left available after the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the New Orleans Pelicans.  As part of a deal between the Bobcats, Pelicans and NBA, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the original Hornets' history and records from 1988 to 2002, while all of the Hornets' history and records from after relocation to New Orleans in 2002 through 2013 remained with the Pelicans. As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001\u201302 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004.",
  "/wiki/2001_NBA_Playoffs": "The 2001 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2000-01 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1. Shaquille O'Neal was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year. Since 2001, the 76ers have not advanced beyond the conference semifinals.\n This was the 76ers' first Finals appearance since Moses Malone and Julius Erving led the 1983 team to the NBA title (coincidentally, last defeating the Lakers) in the famous \"fo', fo', fo'\" year (it ended up being \"fo', fi', fo'\", as Philadelphia lost one second-round game to the Milwaukee Bucks that year).\n However, it was the Lakers' turn to put together the most dominant postseason in NBA history, going 15\u20131 with their only loss coming in OT to the Sixers in Game 1 of the Finals. They set many records, including going undefeated in regulation and on the road (finishing 8\u20130 in the latter category). They were the second NBA champion to defeat four 50-win or better teams on their way to the title as the Rockets did it first in 1995.  The Lakers also equaled the previous records set by their 1989 team by winning their first 11 post-season games and sweeping three series in the post-season. Their playoff dominance would be bested after the first round of playoffs was extended to a best of seven format instead of the best of five in the 2003 NBA playoffs by the 2016-17 Golden State Warriors who would go 16-1 on their way to their fifth championship.\n The Milwaukee Bucks won their first playoff series since 1989, made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1986 and won the division for the first time since that year. They won the division and a playoff series in 2019.\nThe Dallas Mavericks made the playoffs for the first time since 1990. Along the way they had many abysmal seasons, including back-to-back years with 11 and 13 wins. By beating Utah in the first round, they won their first playoff series since 1988. Reunion Arena, their home court for 21 years, hosted its last game (Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Spurs); they moved to American Airlines Center, the next season.\n The Sacramento Kings won their first playoff series since 1981 (when they were the Kansas City Kings) and the first since moving to Sacramento.\n The Toronto Raptors won their first playoff series in franchise history 3\u20132 over the New York Knicks. For the first time since 1991, the Knicks failed to win a first-round playoff series.",
  "/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_droughts": "This is a list of National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise post-season appearance droughts. This list includes the all-time and the active consecutive non-playoffs. Aside from the NBA playoff appearance droughts, this list also includes droughts of series wins, appearances in the NBA Finals and NBA championship wins. The oldest such franchise is the Suns (51 seasons), while the Royals/Kings and the Hawks have even longer championship droughts (68 and 61 seasons, respectively). Six franchises have never been to the NBA Finals, the highest number among the major North American sports. The oldest such team is the Braves/Clippers franchise (49 seasons); the Kings and the Hawks have appearance droughts that are even longer (69 and 59 seasons, respectively). The longest a franchise has gone without appearing in the playoffs at all is 15 seasons: the Braves/Clippers franchise from 1977 to 1991.\n Of the 19 franchises that have won an NBA championship, 8 have droughts of 36 seasons or more, which is to say that the past 36 championships have been shared among only 11 franchises: the Lakers (8), Bulls (6), Spurs (5), Celtics (3), Pistons (3), Heat (3), Warriors (3), Rockets (2), Mavericks (1), Cavaliers (1), and Raptors (1). By contrast, the other three major North American sports have each had at least 16 franchises become champions over the same period of time."
