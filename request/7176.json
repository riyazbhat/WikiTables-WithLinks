  "/wiki/Alma_mater": "Alma mater (Latin: alma mater, lit. 'nourishing mother'; pl. [rarely used] almae matres) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university, school, or college that one formerly attended. In US usage, it can also mean the school from which one graduated. The phrase is variously translated as \"nourishing mother\", \"nursing mother\", or \"fostering mother\", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students.\n Before its current usage, alma mater was an honorific title for various Latin mother goddesses, especially Ceres or Cybele, and later in Catholicism for the Virgin Mary. It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (\"nurturing mother of studies\"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus, a term used for a university graduate that literally means a \"nursling\" or \"one who is nourished\".",

  "/wiki/Fitzwilliam_College,_Cambridge": "Fitzwilliam College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, England. \n The college traces its origins back to 1869 and the foundation of the Non-Collegiate Students Board, a venture intended to offer academically excellent students from less financially privileged backgrounds a chance to study at the university. The institution was originally based at Fitzwilliam Hall (later renamed Fitzwilliam House), opposite the Fitzwilliam Museum in central Cambridge. Having moved to its present site in the north of the city, Fitzwilliam attained collegiate status in 1966. Female undergraduates were first admitted in 1978, around the time most colleges were first admitting women.\n Fitzwilliam is now home to around 475 undergraduates, 400 graduate students and 90 fellows. By overall student numbers, it is the seventh-largest college in Cambridge as of 2018/19. \n Notable alumni of Fitzwilliam College include six Nobel Laureates, prominent academics, three heads of state or government, one current UK Supreme Court Justice, and a significant number of political figures including the former Liberal Democrats leader, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the current and former Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police.",
  "/wiki/Philip_Sales,_Lord_Sales": "Philip James Sales, Lord Sales (born 11 February 1962) is a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. He took office on 14 January 2019. \n He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, Churchill College, Cambridge (BA, 1983), and Worcester College, Oxford (BCL, 1984).\n He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1985. In 1997, he was appointed  First Junior Treasury Counsel (\"Treasury Devil\"), a private practitioner barrister who represents the UK government in the civil courts. This caused \"consternation\" among senior lawyers, according to The Times due to his young age.\n Sales was a practising barrister at 11 King\u2019s Bench Walk. At the time of the appointment, there was debate over Sales' appointment. According to The Guardian, an anonymous source referred to 11KBW as a \"network of old boys and cronies\", and that there was \"no coincidence that the appointment came from Lord Irvine's and Tony Blair's old chambers\". Acting as a barrister Sales defended the New Labour government's decision against holding a public inquiry into the Iraq War in the High Court in 2005.\n He was made a QC in 2006, deputy judge of the High Court from 2004\u20132008, and judge of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) since 2008. He was a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal from July 2014.\n In 2016, Sales, as a member of the Court of Appeal ruled on 12 August 2016 that 130,000 Labour members who joined the party after 12 January 2016 would not be able to vote in the leadership contest, which over-ruled the previous High Court decision to allow the 130,000 disenfranchised Labour Party members to vote in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.\n In October 2016 Sales was one of the three judges forming the divisional court of the High Court in proceedings concerning the use of the royal prerogative for the issue of notification in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. His role in this judgment meant that he appeared in an infamous front-cover of the Daily Mail (Enemies of the People).",
  "/wiki/Churchill_College,_Cambridge": "Churchill College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, England. It has a primary focus on science, engineering and technology, but still retains a strong interest in the arts and humanities.\n In 1958, a trust was established with Sir Winston Churchill as its chairman of trustees, to build and endow a college for 60 fellows and 540 students as a national and Commonwealth memorial to Winston Churchill; its Royal Charter and Statutes were approved by the Queen, in August 1960. It is situated on the outskirts of Cambridge, away from the traditional centre of the city, but close to the University's main new development zone (which now houses the Centre for Mathematical Sciences), which some would argue is the new city centre. Its 16 hectares (40 acres) of grounds make it physically the largest of all the colleges.\n Churchill was the first all-male college to decide to admit women, and was among three men's colleges to admit its first women students in 1972. Within 15 years all others had followed suit. The college has a reputation for relative informality compared with other Cambridge colleges, and traditionally admits a larger proportion of its undergraduates from state schools.\n The college motto is \"Forward\". It was taken from the final phrase of Winston Churchill's first speech to the House of Commons as Prime Minister \u2013 his famous \"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat\" speech \u2013 in which he said \"Come, then, let us go forward together\".",
