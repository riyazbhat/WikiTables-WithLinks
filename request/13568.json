  "/wiki/Peelander-Z": "Peelander-Z is a Japanese punk band based in Austin, Texas, in 1998 by Peelander-Yellow, Peelander-Red, and Peelander-Blue. They bill themselves as a \"Japanese Action Comic Punk band hailing from the Z area of Planet Peelander\". While the founding members of Peelander-Z were all born in Japan, they first met and formed their band while living in New York.\n They perform on stage and appear in color-coordinated costumes, which they state are not costumes, but their skin. The costumes range from sentai style suits, to kimono, to rubber Playmobil style wigs. There is also a tiger costume and a giant squid/guitar costume to coincide with the song \"Mad Tiger\". Another aspect of their routine is their on-stage antics such as human bowling (diving head-first into bowling pins), pretending to hit each other with chairs in imitation of pro-wrestlers, and mid-performance piggyback rides. They often allow audience members on stage to join in on the fun, and often dive into the audience or hang from a balcony as part of their act.\n In 1999 the band released a mini album on Eat Rice Records. The band was also featured on an episode of the Upright Citizens Brigade on Comedy Central.\n In 2001 Peelander-Z released their first full-length album, Rocket Gold Star on Eat Rice Records.  Band remained active this year touring both Canada and Japan.\n In June 2008, Peelander Blue announced he would be leaving the group to \"go back to the Peelander-planet\" because he is \"a prince of P-Planet\" and the \"P-King will be retiring.\" (P-Blue was getting married and could no longer tour.) In July 2008, Peelander-Z welcomed Peelander-Green.\n On September 17, 2012 Peelander-Red announced he would be leaving the band at the end of their U.S. tour. He left the band to open up his own bar in New York. Peelander-Purple joined the band as his replacement in February 2013.\n In late 2013, Peelander Green left the band and has since been replaced by several temporary members, including Becoming the Archetype drummer Chris Heaton. He was later replaced by Ryo Tanaka, formerly of the Japanese band Spica.\n Videos surfacing from 2015 live concerts show Peelander-Z performing as only a three-piece band with Yellow on Guitar, Green on drums and Pink on bass.\n In 2016, Film Movement released Mad Tiger, the feature documentary film about the band's inner turmoil during and after Peelander-Red's departure. The film was in production from 2012 to 2015 and was directed by Jonathan Yi and Michael Haertlein.\n Peelander-Z released an album titled Go PZ Go on April 6, 2018.",
