  "/wiki/Armenia": "The original native Armenian name for the country was \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 (Hayk\u2019); however, it is currently rarely used. The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 (Hayastan) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan (place). [citation needed]. However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos, Faustus of Byzantium, Ghazar Parpetsi, Koryun, and Sebeos. The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk (\u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f), the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah, who, according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene (Movsis Khorenatsi), defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region. The further origin of the name is uncertain. It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated, Hittite vassal states\u2014the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi (1600\u20131200 BC). The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription (515 BC) as Armina (    ).",
