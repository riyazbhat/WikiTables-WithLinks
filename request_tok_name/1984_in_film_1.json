  "/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States": "The cinema of the United States , often metonymously referred to as Hollywood , has had a large effect on the film industry in general since the early 20th century . The dominant style of American cinema is classical Hollywood cinema , which developed from 1913 to 1969 and characterizes most films made there to this day . While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema , American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry . It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema , with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year . While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom ( 299 ) , Canada ( 206 ) , Australia , and New Zealand also produce films in the same language , they are not considered part of the Hollywood system . Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema . Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles , often in Spanish or French . Contemporary Hollywood off-shores production to Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . Hollywood is considered the oldest film industry where earliest film studios and production companies emerged , it is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema - among them comedy , drama , action , the musical , romance , horror , science fiction , and the war epic - having set an example for other national film industries . In 1878 , Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion . In 1894 , the world 's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City , using Thomas Edison 's kinetoscope . The United States produced the world 's first sync-sound musical film , The Jazz Singer , in 1927 , and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades .",

For decades , Hong Kong was the third largest motion picture industry in the world ( after Indian cinema and Hollywood ) and the second largest exporter . Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong 's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 , Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage . In the West , Hong Kong 's vigorous pop cinema ( especially Hong Kong action cinema ) has long had a strong cult following , which is now arguably a part of the cultural mainstream , widely available and imitated . Economically , the film industry together with the value added of cultural and creative industries represents 5 per cent of Hong Kong 's economy .",

The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina [ it ] , a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers , who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896 .

As of 2018 , Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film ( the most of any country ) as well as 12 Palmes d'Or ( the second-most of any country ) , one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears . Italy is a birthplace of Art Cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been the most important factor in the history of Italian movies . In the early 1900s , artistic and epic films such as Otello ( 1906 ) , The Last Days of Pompeii ( 1908 ) , L'Inferno ( 1911 ) , Quo Vadis ( 1913 ) , and Cabiria ( 1914 ) , were made as adaptations of books or stage plays . Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs , lavish costumes , and record budgets , to produce pioneering films . One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements , Italian Futurism , took place in Italy in the late 1910s . After a period of decline in the 1920s , the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film . A popular Italian genre during this period , the Telefoni Bianchi , consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds . While Italy 's Fascist government provided financial support for the nation 's film industry , most notably the construction of the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios ( the largest film studio in Europe ) , it also engaged in censorship , and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films .

It includes the highest-grossing films in the Soviet Union ( USSR ) , the highest-grossing domestic Soviet films , the domestic films with the greatest number of ticket sales by year , and the highest-grossing foreign films in the Soviet Union . Note that , in line with the definition above , this list does not include any Soviet television series or television movies , which were not shown in cinemas of the Soviet Union . The annual list includes sales during each year only , which often means that the total number of tickets sold was bigger . As an example , according to the list below the film The Red Snowball Tree , the top seller of the year 1974 , sold 62.5 million tickets during that year . But the total number of sold tickets during all years was bigger ( former deputy director of the USSR GosKino Boris Pavlenok named 140 million , however , it was clearly exaggeration ) .

Both domestic Soviet films and foreign films were shown , the latter having a limited quota and thus drawing higher average ticket sales than domestic productions .",
