  "/wiki/Thomas_More": "Sir Thomas More ( 7 February 1478 - 6 July 1535 ) , venerated in the Catholic Church as Saint Thomas More , was an English lawyer , social philosopher , author , statesman , and noted Renaissance humanist . He was also a Chancellor to Henry VIII , and Lord High Chancellor of England from October 1529 to 16 May 1532 . He wrote Utopia , published in 1516 , about the political system of an imaginary , ideal island nation . More opposed the Protestant Reformation , directing polemics against the theology of Martin Luther , John Calvin and William Tyndale . More also opposed King Henry VIII 's separation from the Catholic Church , refusing to acknowledge Henry as Supreme Head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon . After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy , he was convicted of treason and executed . On his execution , he was reported to have said : I die the King 's good servant , and God 's first . Pope Pius XI canonized More in 1935 as a martyr . Pope John Paul II in 2000 declared him the patron saint of Statesmen and Politicians . Since 1980 , the Church of England has remembered More liturgically as a Reformation martyr . Praised by Marx and Engels , the Soviet Union in the early twentieth century honored him for the purportedly communist attitude toward property rights expressed in Utopia .",
  "/wiki/Edward_I_of_England": "Edward I ( 17/18 June 1239 - 7 July 1307 ) , also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots ( Latin : Malleus Scotorum ) , was King of England from 1272 to 1307 . He was the fifth king of the House of Plantagenet . Before his accession to the throne , he was commonly referred to as Lord Edward . The first son of Henry III , Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father 's reign , which included an outright rebellion by the English barons . In 1259 , he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement , supporting the Provisions of Oxford . After reconciliation with his father , however , he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict , known as the Second Barons ' War . After the Battle of Lewes , Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons , but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 . Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and , with England pacified , Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land . He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died . Making a slow return , he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey . Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law . Through an extensive legal inquiry , he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties , while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law .",
  "/wiki/Edward_VII_of_England": "Edward VII ( Albert Edward ; 9 November 1841 - 6 May 1910 ) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India from 22 January 1901 until his death in 1910 . The eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe . He was Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne for almost 60 years . During the long reign of his mother , he was largely excluded from political power , and came to personify the fashionable , leisured elite . He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties , and represented Britain on visits abroad . His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes , but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother . As king , Edward played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War . He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised . He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries , especially France , for which he was popularly called Peacemaker , but his relationship with his nephew , the German Emperor Wilhelm II , was poor . The Edwardian era , which covered Edward 's reign and was named after him , coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society , including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism . He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911 , which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords .",

  "/wiki/Charles_Dickens": "Charles John Huffam Dickens FRSA ( /\u02c8d\u026ak\u026anz/ ; 7 February 1812 - 9 June 1870 ) was an English writer and social critic . He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era . His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the 20th century , critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories are still widely read today . Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed readings extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms . Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features .",

His works are credited with developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution . Bacon has been called the father of empiricism . His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature . Most importantly , he argued science could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves . Although his practical ideas about such a method , the Baconian method , did not have a long-lasting influence , the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method . This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science , the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology . Francis Bacon was a patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories - history , poetry , and philosophy - which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings . Bacon was educated at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum , largely in Latin . Bacon was the first recipient of the Queen 's counsel designation , which was conferred in 1597 when Elizabeth I of England reserved Bacon as her legal advisor .

It is today managed by the London Borough of Camden and forms part of the southern boundary of that borough with the City of Westminster .
