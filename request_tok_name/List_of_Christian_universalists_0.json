  "/wiki/English_people": "The English people are a nation and an ethnic group native to England who speak the English language . The English identity is of early medieval origin , when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn ( family of the Angles ) . Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles , one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD . England is the largest and most populous country of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and the majority of people living there are British citizens . The English largely descend from two main historical population groups - the earlier Celtic Britons ( or Brythons ) and the Germanic tribes who settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans : the Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England ( from the Old English Englaland ) by the early 10th century , in response to the invasion and minor settlement of Danes beginning in the late 9th century . This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Anglo-Normans in England in the latter 11th century . In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain . Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general . The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis . These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire .",
  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",
  "/wiki/Presbyterianism": "Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism , which traces its origins to Britain , particularly Scotland . Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way , but the word Presbyterian , when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland , as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War . Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God , the authority of the Scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ . Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . In fact , most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection , and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America , mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants . The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors , although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism . Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) . The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century , the example of John Calvin 's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential . Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government . In the twentieth century , some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement , including the World Council of Churches . Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions , especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches .",

  "/wiki/William_Law": "William Law ( 1686 - 9 April 1761 ) was a Church of England priest who lost his position at Emmanuel College , Cambridge when his conscience would not allow him to take the required oath of allegiance to the first Hanoverian monarch , King George I . Previously William Law had given his allegiance to the House of Stuart and is sometimes considered a second-generation non-juror ( an earlier generation of non-jurors included Thomas Ken ) . Thereafter , Law first continued as a simple priest ( curate ) and when that too became impossible without the required oath , Law taught privately , as well as wrote extensively . His personal integrity , as well as mystic and theological writing greatly influenced the evangelical movement of his day as well as Enlightenment thinkers such as the writer Dr Samuel Johnson and the historian Edward Gibbon . In 1784 William Wilberforce ( 1759-1833 ) , the politician , philanthropist and leader of the movement to stop the slave trade , was deeply touched by reading William Law 's book A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life ( 1729 ) .

In contemporary English , his name may be spelled Jacob Boehme ; in seventeenth-century England it was also spelled Behmen , approximating the contemporary English pronunciation of the German B\u00f6hme .

  "/wiki/German_people": "Germans ( ) are a Germanic ethnic group native to Central Europe , who share a common German ancestry , culture and history . German is the shared mother tongue of a substantial majority of ethnic Germans . The English term Germans has historically referred to the German-speaking population of the Holy Roman Empire since the Late Middle Ages . Ever since the outbreak of the Protestant Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire , German society has been characterized by a Catholic-Protestant divide . Of approximately 100 million native speakers of German in the world , roughly 80 million consider themselves Germans . There are an additional 80 million people of German ancestry mainly in the United States , Brazil ( mainly in the South Region of the country ) , Argentina , Canada , South Africa , the post-Soviet states ( mainly in Russia and Kazakhstan ) , and France , each accounting for at least 1 million . Thus , the total number of Germans lies somewhere between 100 and more than 150 million , depending on the criteria applied ( native speakers , single-ancestry ethnic Germans , partial German ancestry , etc. ) . Today , people from countries with German-speaking majorities which were earlier part of the Holy Roman Empire , ( such as Austria , Switzerland , Liechtenstein and other historically-tied countries like Luxembourg ) , most often subscribe to their own national identities and may or may not also self-identify as ethnically German .",
  "/wiki/Reformed_Christianity": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millenium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox .

  "/wiki/Kabbalah": "Kabbalah ( , literally reception , tradition or correspondence ) is an esoteric method , discipline , and school of thought in Jewish mysticism . A traditional Kabbalist in Judaism is called a Mequbb\u0101l ( ) . The definition of Kabbalah varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it , from its religious origin as an integral part of Judaism , to its later adaptations in Western esotericism ( Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah ) . Jewish Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between God , the unchanging , eternal , and mysterious Ein Sof ( , The Infinite ) , and the mortal and finite universe ( God 's creation ) . It forms the foundation of mystical religious interpretations within Judaism . Jewish Kabbalists originally developed their own transmission of sacred texts within the realm of Jewish tradition , and often use classical Jewish scriptures to explain and demonstrate its mystical teachings . These teachings are held by followers in Judaism to define the inner meaning of both the Hebrew Bible and traditional rabbinic literature and their formerly concealed transmitted dimension , as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances . One of the fundamental kabbalistic texts , the Zohar , was first published in the 13th century , and the almost universal form adhered to in modern Judaism is Lurianic Kabbalah . Traditional practitioners believe its earliest origins pre-date world religions , forming the primordial blueprint for Creation 's philosophies , religions , sciences , arts , and political systems . Historically , Kabbalah emerged after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism , in 12th- to 13th-century Spain and Southern France , and was reinterpreted during the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century Ottoman Palestine . Isaac Luria is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah ; Lurianic Kabbalah was popularised in the form of Hasidic Judaism from the 18th century onwards . During the 20th-century , academic interest in Kabbalistic texts led primarily by the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem has inspired the development of historical research on Kabbalah in the field of Judaic studies .",

He was a Baronet in the Jacobite Peerage . Ramsay was born in Ayr , Scotland , the son of a baker . In 1710 he visited Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon in the Netherlands , and in his attraction to quietism converted to Roman Catholicism . He remained in France until 1724 writing politico-theological treatises . One of these was dedicated to the Jacobite claimant to the English and Scottish thrones , James Francis Edward Stuart . In January 1724 , Ramsay was sent to Rome as tutor to James ' two sons , Charles Edward and Henry . But his appointment was short-lived ; Ramsay was associated with the court party of John Erskine , Duke of Mar , who fell from favour that year . By November 1724 Ramsay was back in Paris . Ramsay was in England in 1730 , and received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford . The claim was nominally his discipleship to F\u00e9nelon , but in reality beyond doubt his connection with the Jacobite party . He died at St Germain-en-Laye ( \u00cele-de-France ) on 6 May 1743 .",

Later , the neighbouring Celtic-speaking Cumbrians , as well as Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons and Norse , were incorporated into the Scottish nation . In modern usage , Scottish people or Scots is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic , cultural , family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland . The Latin word Scoti originally referred to the Gaels , but came to describe all inhabitants of Scotland . Considered pejorative , the term Scotch has also been used for Scottish people , primarily outside Scotland . People of Scottish descent live in many countries . Emigration , influenced by factors such as the Highland and Lowland Clearances , Scottish participation in the British Empire , and latterly industrial decline and unemployment , have resulted in Scottish people being found throughout the world . Scottish emigrants took with them their Scottish languages and culture . Large populations of Scottish people settled the new-world lands of North and South America , Australia and New Zealand .
