  "/wiki/Britannia": "Britannia ( /br\u026a\u02c8t\u00e6ni\u0259/ ) has been used in several different senses , but is best known as a national personification of the United Kingdom . The name is a Latinisation of the native Brittonic word for the island , Pretan\u012b , which also produced the Greek form Prettanike or Brettaniai , which originally , in the fourth to the first centuries BC , designated a collection of islands with individual names , including Albion or Britain . In Modern Welsh the name remains Prydain . By the 1st century BC , Britannia came to be used for Great Britain specifically . After the Roman conquest in 43 AD , Britannia meant Roman Britain , a province covering the island south of Caledonia ( roughly Scotland ) . When Roman Britain was divided into four provinces in 197 AD , two were called Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior . Britannia is the name given to the female personification of the island , and it is a term still used to refer to the whole island .",

It is the terminus for Eurostar services from London to Belgium , France and the Netherlands . It provides East Midlands Railway services to Corby , Sheffield and Nottingham on the Midland Main Line , Southeastern high-speed trains to Kent via Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International , and Thameslink cross-London services to Bedford , Peterborough , Brighton and Gatwick Airport . It stands between the British Library , the Regent 's Canal and King 's Cross railway station , with which it shares a London Underground station , King 's Cross St. Pancras . The station was constructed by the Midland Railway ( MR ) , which had an extensive network across the Midlands and the North of England , but no dedicated line into London . After rail traffic problems following the 1862 International Exhibition , the MR decided to build a connection from Bedford to London with their own terminus . The station was designed by William Henry Barlow and constructed with a single-span iron roof . Following the station 's opening on 1 October 1868 , the MR constructed the Midland Grand Hotel on the station 's fa\u00e7ade , which has been widely praised for its architecture and is now a Grade I listed building along with the rest of the station . By the 1960s , St Pancras was surplus to requirements and services were diverted to King 's Cross and Euston but there was fierce opposition to its proposed closure and demolition of the station and hotel . The station was reinvented in the late 20th century as the terminal for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in an urban regeneration plan across East London . The complex underwent an \u00a3800 million refurbishment which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2007 . A security-sealed terminal area was constructed for Eurostar services to mainland Europe via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel , with platforms for domestic trains to the north and south-east of England .",

His influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education . By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period .",

It was commissioned by British Rail in 1980 for the forecourt of Euston Station in London , and is named for the German theatre director Erwin Piscator . The sculpture is made from cast iron with an aluminium finish , and was cast by the ironfounders Robert Taylor and Co . It measures 3.1 by 4.6 by 1.85 metres ( 10.2 ft \u00d7 15.1 ft \u00d7 6.1 ft ) . In making the work , Paolozzi was assisted by Ray Watson . The sides of the sculpture have silvered bumps and hollows ; viewed from above , the top surface resolves into a blocky human body and face . [ original research ? ] It is described in Pevsner as a silvered block with curved hollows , and rectangular shapes above . In late 2016 , it was reported that the ownership of the sculpture was unclear . It was commissioned by British Rail , which was privatised in the 1990s , and the sculpture may have been inherited by Network Rail , who owns the freehold of the land on which it sits . However , Network Rail has denied ownership , saying that the land is leased to Sydney & London Properties , but the leaseholders have also denied any responsibility for the sculpture .

  "/wiki/Eduardo_Paolozzi": "Eduardo Paolozzi was born on 7 March 1924 , in Leith in north Edinburgh , Scotland , and was the eldest son of Italian immigrants . In June 1940 , when Italy declared war on the United Kingdom , Paolozzi was interned ( along with most other Italian men in Britain ) . During his three-month internment at Saughton prison his father , grandfather and uncle , who had also been detained , were among the 446 Italians who drowned when the ship carrying them to Canada , the Arandora Star , was sunk by a German U-boat . Paolozzi studied at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1943 , briefly at Saint Martin 's School of Art in 1944 , and then at the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London from 1944 to 1947 , after which he worked in Paris . While in Paris from 1947 to 1949 , Paolozzi became acquainted with Alberto Giacometti , Jean Arp , Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i , Georges Braque and Fernand L\u00e9ger . This period became an important influence for his later work . For example , the influence of Giacometti and many of the original Surrealists he met in Paris can be felt in the group of lost-wax sculptures made by Paolozzi in the mid-1950s . Their surfaces , studded with found objects and machine parts , were to gain him recognition .",
  "/wiki/Newton_(Paolozzi)": "Newton , sometimes known as Newton after Blake , is a 1995 work by the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi . The large bronze sculpture is displayed on a high plinth in the piazza outside the British Library in London . The sculpture is based on William Blake 's 1795 print of Newton : Personification of Man Limited by Reason , which depicts a naked Isaac Newton sitting on ledge beside a mossy rock face while measuring with a pair of compasses or dividers . The print was intended by Blake to criticise Newton 's profane knowledge , usurping the sacred knowledge and power of the creator Urizen , with the scientist turning away from nature to focus on his books . Paolozzi had admired Blake since viewing a large print of Newton at the Tate Gallery in the 1940s . He was also a friend of Colin St John Wilson , the architect of the British Library , since they both participated in the This is Tomorrow exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956 . Wilson intended to site a seated sculpture at the junction of the two main axes in the piazza of his library . Paolozzi was then working on a sculpture of Newton , and he was commissioned to create the sculpture for the library . The new library was constructed from 1982 to 1999 , and the sculpture was installed in 1995 . The sculpture includes Paolozzi 's self-portrait as the naked Newton , measuring the universe with his dividers . The eyes were copied from Michelangelo 's David . It can be interpreted as symbolising a confluence of the two cultures , the arts and the sciences , and illustrating how Newton changed our view of the world to one determined by mathematical laws .",
  "/wiki/Isaac_Newton": "Sir Isaac Newton PRS ( 25 December 1642 - 20 March 1726/27 [ a ] ) was an English mathematician , physicist , astronomer , theologian , and author ( described in his own day as a natural philosopher ) who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution . His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations of classical mechanics . Newton also made seminal contributions to optics , and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus . In Principia , Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity . Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , account for tides , the trajectories of comets , the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena , eradicating doubt about the Solar System 's heliocentricity . He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles . Newton 's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis , La Condamine , and others , convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems . Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum . His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks , published in 1704 . He also formulated an empirical law of cooling , made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound , and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid . In addition to his work on calculus , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , developed a method for approximating the roots of a function , and classified most of the cubic plane curves . Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .",

Abel Tasman had circumnavigated it more widely in 1642-43 and had charted its north coast in 1644 . Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810 . In the second voyage , George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen 's Land ( now Tasmania ) was an island . In the third voyage , Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia , accompanied by Aboriginal man Bungaree . Heading back to England in 1803 , Flinders ' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France ( Mauritius ) . Although Britain and France were at war , Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage , but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years . In captivity , he recorded details of his voyages for future publication , and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia ' , as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales - a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie . Flinders ' health had suffered , however , and although he reached home in 1810 , he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas , A Voyage to Terra Australis .

He was the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives in Britain , including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific engines . An A1 Pacific , Flying Scotsman , was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service , and an A4 , number 4468 Mallard , still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world ( 126 mph ) . Gresley 's engines were considered elegant , both aesthetically and mechanically . His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear , the Gresley conjugated valve gear , produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear .",
  "/wiki/London_King's_Cross_railway_station": "King 's Cross railway station , also known as London King 's Cross , is a passenger railway terminus in the London Borough of Camden , on the edge of Central London . It is in the London station group , one of the busiest stations in the United Kingdom and the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line to North East England and Scotland . Adjacent to King 's Cross station is St Pancras International , the London terminus for Eurostar services to continental Europe . Beneath both main line stations is King 's Cross St Pancras tube station on the London Underground ; combined they form one of the country 's largest transport hubs . The station was opened in Kings Cross in 1852 by the Great Northern Railway on the northern edge of Central London to accommodate the East Coast Main Line . It quickly grew to cater for suburban lines and was expanded several times in the 19th century . It came under the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway as part of the Big Four grouping in 1923 , who introduced famous services such as the Flying Scotsman and locomotives such as Mallard . The station complex was redeveloped in the 1970s , simplifying the layout and providing electric suburban services , and it became a major terminus for the high-speed InterCity 125 . As of 2018 [ update ] , long-distance trains from King 's Cross are run by London North Eastern Railway to Edinburgh Waverley , Leeds and Newcastle ; other long-distance operators include Hull Trains and Grand Central . In addition , Great Northern runs suburban commuter trains in and around north London . In the late 20th century , the area around the station became known for its seedy and downmarket character , and was used as a backdrop for several films as a result . A major redevelopment was undertaken in the 21st century , including restoration of the original roof , and the station became well known for its association with the Harry Potter books and films , particularly the fictional Platform 9\u00be .",
