  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south .

Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east .

It borders Hungary to the north , Romania to the northeast , Bulgaria to the southeast , North Macedonia to the south , Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west , and Montenegro to the southwest . The country claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo . [ a ] Serbia 's population numbers approximately seven million . Its capital , Belgrade , ranks among the largest citi\u0435s in southeastern Europe . Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age , the territory of modern-day Serbia faced Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th century , establishing several regional states in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the Byzantine , Frankish and Hungarian kingdoms . The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s . In 2008 , the parliament of the province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence , with mixed responses from the international community .",

The island is geographically separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait . The legislative capital , Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte , is a suburb of the commercial capital and largest city , Colombo . Sri Lanka 's documented history spans 3,000 years , with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years . It has a rich cultural heritage , and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka , the P\u0101li Canon , date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in 29 BC . Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to the modern Maritime Silk Road . Sri Lanka was known in the west and from the beginning of British colonial rule as Ceylon ( /s\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ , US also /se\u026a\u02c8l\u0252n/ ) . A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence , which was granted in 1948 ; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972 . Sri Lanka 's recent history has been marred by a 26-year civil war , which ended decisively when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in 2009 . The current constitution stipulates the political system as a republic and a unitary state governed by a semi-presidential system . It has had a long history of international engagement , as a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) , and a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the G77 , and the Non-Aligned Movement . Along with the Maldives , Sri Lanka is one of only two South Asian countries rated high on the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , with its HDI rating and per capita income the highest among South Asian nations ."
