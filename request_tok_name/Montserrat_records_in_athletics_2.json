  "/wiki/100_metres": "The 100 metres , or 100-metre dash , is a sprint race in track and field competitions . The shortest common outdoor running distance , it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics . It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women . The World Championships 100 metres has been contested since 1983 .",
  "/wiki/200_metres": "The 200 metres ( also spelt 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",

  "/wiki/400_metres": "The 400 metres , or 400 metre dash , is a sprinting event in track and field competitions . It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women . On a standard outdoor running track , it is one lap around the track . Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course . In many countries , athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash ( 402.336 m ) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile ' - instead of the 400 m ( 437.445 yards ) , though this distance is now obsolete . Like other sprint disciplines , the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks . The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready ' command , adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set ' command , and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter 's pistol . The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability . Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event , but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap . While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event , there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate . The current men 's world record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa , with a time of 43.03 seconds ; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion . Steven Gardiner is the reigning World Champion .",
  "/wiki/Leamington_Spa": "Royal Leamington Spa , commonly known as Leamington Spa or simply Leamington , is a spa town in Warwickshire , England . Originally a small village called Leamington Priors , it grew into a spa town in the 18th century following the popularisation of its water which was reputed to have medicinal qualities . In the 19th century , the town experienced one of the most rapid expansions in England . It is named after the River Leam , which flows through the town . The town contains especially fine ensembles of Regency architecture , particularly in parts of the Parade , Clarendon Square and Lansdowne Circus . In the 2011 census Leamington had a population of 55,733 . Leamington is contiguous with the neighbouring towns of Warwick and Whitnash , which together form a continuous urban area , in 2011 the urban area had a population of 95,172 .",
  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events .",
  "/wiki/Road_Town": "Road Town , located on Tortola , is the capital of the British Virgin Islands . It is situated on the horseshoe-shaped Road Harbour in the centre of the island 's south coast . The population was about 9,400 in 2004 . The name is derived from the nautical term the roads , a place less sheltered than a harbour but which ships can easily get to . A 28 hectares ( 69 acres ) development called Wickham 's Cay , consisting of two areas that were reclaimed from the sea and a marina , have enabled Road Town to emerge as a haven for yacht chartering and a centre of tourism . This area is the newest part of the city and the hub for the new commercial and administrative buildings of the BVI . The oldest building in Road Town , HM Prison on Main Street , was built in 1774 .",
  "/wiki/1500_metres": "The 1500 metres or 1,500-metre run ( typically pronounced 'fifteen-hundred metres ' ) is the foremost middle distance track event in athletics . The distance has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 and the World Championships in Athletics since 1983 . It is equivalent to 1.5 kilometers or approximately \u200b15\u204416 miles . The demands of the race are similar to that of the 800 metres , but with a slightly higher emphasis on aerobic endurance and a slightly lower sprint speed requirement . The 1500 metre race is predominantly aerobic , but anaerobic conditioning is also required . Each lap run during the world-record race run by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 in Rome , Italy averaged just under 55 seconds ( or under 13.8 seconds per 100 metres ) . 1,500 metres is three and three-quarter laps around a 400-metre track . During the 1970s and 1980s this race was dominated by British runners , along with an occasional Finn , American , or New Zealander , but through the 1990s many African runners began to win Olympic medals in this race , especially runners from Kenya , Morocco and Algeria . In the Modern Olympic Games , the men 's 1,500-metre race has been contested from the beginning , and at every Olympic Games since . The first winner , in 1896 , was Edwin Flack of Australia , who also won the first gold medal in the 800-metre race . The women 's 1,500-metre race was first added to the Summer Olympics in 1972 , and the winner of the first gold medal was Lyudmila Bragina of the Soviet Union . During the Olympic Games of 1972 through 2008 , the women 's 1,500-metre race has been won by three Soviets plus one Russian , one Italian , one Romanian , one Briton , one Kenyan , and two Algerians .",
  "/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands": "The British Virgin Islands ( abbreviated BVI ) , officially simply the Virgin Islands , are a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean , to the east of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and north-west of Anguilla .

  "/wiki/3000_metres": "The 3000 metres or 3000-metre run is a track running event , also commonly known as the 3K or 3K run , where 7.5 laps are completed around an outdoor 400 m track or 15 laps around a 200 m indoor track . It is debated whether the 3000m should be classified as a middle distance or long distance event . In elite level competition , 3000 m pace is more comparable to the pace found in the longer 5000 metres event , rather than mile pace . The world record performance for 3000 m equates to a pace of 58.76 seconds per 400 m , which is closer to the 60.58 seconds for 5000 m than the 55.46 seconds for the mile . However , the 3000 m does require some anaerobic conditioning and an elite athlete needs to develop a high tolerance to lactic acid , as does the mile runner . Thus , the 3000 m demands a balance of aerobic endurance needed for the 5000 m and lactic acid tolerance needed for the Mile . In men 's athletics , 3000 metres has been an Olympic discipline only as a team race at the 1912 , 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics . It has not been contested at any of the IAAF outdoor championships , but is occasionally hosted at annual elite track and field meetings . It is often featured in indoor track and field programmes and is the longest distance event present at the IAAF World Indoor Championships . In women 's athletics , 3000 metres was a standard event in the Olympic Games ( 1984 to 1992 ) and World Championships ( 1980 to 1993 ) . The event was discontinued at World Championship and Olympic level after the 1993 World Championships in Athletics - Qu Yunxia being the final gold medal winner at the event . Starting with the 1995 World Championships in Athletics and the 1996 Olympic Games , it was replaced by 5000 metres , with other IAAF-organized championships following suit .",

The island is in the Leeward Islands , which is part of the chain known as the Lesser Antilles , in the West Indies . Montserrat measures approximately 16 km ( 10 mi ) in length and 11 km ( 7 mi ) in width , with approximately 40 km ( 25 mi ) of coastline . Montserrat is nicknamed The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean both for its resemblance to coastal Ireland and for the Irish ancestry of many of its inhabitants . On 18 July 1995 , the previously dormant Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano , in the southern part of the island , became active . Eruptions destroyed Montserrat 's Georgian era capital city of Plymouth . Between 1995 and 2000 , two-thirds of the island 's population was forced to flee , primarily to the United Kingdom , leaving fewer than 1,200 people on the island in 1997 ( rising to nearly 5,000 by 2016 ) . The volcanic activity continues , mostly affecting the vicinity of Plymouth , including its docking facilities , and the eastern side of the island around the former W. H. Bramble Airport , the remnants of which were buried by flows from volcanic activity on 11 February 2010 . An exclusion zone , encompassing the southern half of the island to as far north as parts of the Belham Valley , was imposed because of the size of the existing volcanic dome and the resulting potential for pyroclastic activity . Visitors are generally not permitted entry into the exclusion zone , but a view of the destruction of Plymouth can be seen from the top of Garibaldi Hill in Isles Bay . Relatively quiet since early 2010 , the volcano continues to be closely monitored by the Montserrat Volcano Observatory . A new town and port are being developed at Little Bay , which is on the northwest coast of the island .",
  "/wiki/100_metres_hurdles": "The 100 metres hurdles , or 100-meter hurdles , is a track and field event run mainly by women ( the male counterpart is the 110 metres hurdles ) . For the race , ten hurdles of a height of 83.8 centimetres ( 33.0 in ) are placed along a straight course of 100 metres ( 109.36 yd ) . The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line . The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other , and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long . The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner , but weighted so this is disadvantageous . Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose . Like the 100 metres sprint , the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in starting blocks . The fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds . The world record set by Kendra Harrison stands at 12.20 seconds .",
