  "/wiki/Christian_denomination": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity , identified by traits such as a name , organization , leadership and doctrine . The Roman Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , and Oriental Orthodoxy , meaning the large majority , all self-describe as churches , whereas many Protestant denominations self-describe as congregations or fellowships . Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine ; issues such as the nature of Jesus , the authority of apostolic succession , ecclesiology , eschatology , and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another . Groups of denominations - often sharing broadly similar beliefs , practices , and historical ties - are sometimes known as branches of Christianity . These branches differ in many ways , especially through differences in practices and belief . Individual denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another . Several groups claim to be the direct and sole authentic successor of the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD . Others , however , believe in denominationalism , where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels , beliefs , and practices . Because of this concept , some Christian bodies reject the term denomination to describe themselves , to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations . The Roman Catholic Church , which has over 1.3 billion members - slightly over half of all Christians worldwide - does not view itself as a denomination , but as the original pre-denominational church , a view rejected by other Christians . Protestant denominations account for approximately 37 percent of Christians worldwide . Together , Catholicism and Protestantism ( including Anglicanism , and other denominations sharing historical ties ) comprise Western Christianity .",
  "/wiki/Manchester_City_Centre": "Manchester city centre is the central business district of Manchester , England , within the boundaries of Trinity Way , Great Ancoats Street and Whitworth Street . The City Centre ward had a population of 17,861 at the 2011 census . Manchester city centre evolved from the civilian vicus of the Roman fort of Mamucium , on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . This became the township of Manchester during the Middle Ages , and was the site of the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 . Manchester was granted city status in 1853 , after the Industrial Revolution , from which the city centre emerged as the global centre of the cotton trade which encouraged its splendidly imposing commercial architecture during the Victorian era , such as the Royal Exchange , the Corn Exchange , the Free Trade Hall , and the Great Northern Warehouse . After the decline of the cotton trade and the Manchester Blitz , the city centre suffered economic decline during the mid-20th century , but the CIS Tower ranked as the tallest building in the UK when completed in 1962 . The city centre acts as the transport interchange for Greater Manchester and over 7 million people live within an hour 's drive of it . The 1996 Manchester bombing provided the impetus for the redevelopment of the city centre and an upturn in retail , leisure , offices and urban living . The economy of the city centre is built primarily on retail and services , accounting for nearly 40% of Grade A city centre office space outside London .",
  "/wiki/Assemblies_of_God": "The Assemblies of God ( AG ) , officially the World Assemblies of God Fellowship , is a group of over 144 autonomous self-governing associated national groupings of churches which together form the world 's largest Pentecostal denomination . It is the fourth largest international Christian group of denominations and the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world . As an international fellowship , the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous ; however , they are united by shared beliefs and history . The Assemblies originated from the Azusa Street Revival of the early 20th century . This revival led to the founding of the Assemblies of God in the United States in 1914 . Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches , the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement . It was not until 1988 , however , that the world fellowship was formed . As a Pentecostal fellowship , the Assemblies of God believes in the Pentecostal distinctive of baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues . The Assemblies of God should not be confused with the Assemblies of God International Fellowship , the International Assemblies of God Fellowship , and the Independent Assemblies of God International , all of which are Pentecostal denominations .",
  "/wiki/Ancoats": "Ancoats is an area of Manchester in North West England , next to the Northern Quarter , the northern part of Manchester city centre . Historically in Lancashire , Ancoats became a cradle of the Industrial Revolution and has been called the world 's first industrial suburb . For many years , from the late 18th century onwards , Ancoats was a thriving industrial district . The area suffered accelerating economic decline from the 1930s and depopulation in the years after the Second World War , particularly during the slum clearances of the 1960s . Since the 1990s Ancoats ' industrial heritage has been recognised and its proximity to the city centre has led to investment and substantial regeneration . The southern part of the area is branded as New Islington , by UK property developers Urban Splash , while the north retains the Ancoats name , with redevelopment centred on the Daily Express Building .

  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Charismatic_Evangelical": "Charismatic Christianity ( also known as Spirit-filled Christianity by its supporters ) is a form of Christianity that emphasizes the work of the Holy Spirit , spiritual gifts , and modern-day miracles as an everyday part of a believer 's life . Practitioners are often called Charismatic Christians or Renewalists . Although there is considerable overlap , Charismatic Christianity is often categorized into three separate groups : Pentecostalism , the Charismatic Movement and Neo-charismatic movement . The movement is distinguished from Pentecostalism by not making the speaking in tongues ( glossolalia ) a necessary evidence of Spirit baptism and giving prominence to the diversity of spiritual gifts . According to the Pew Research Center , Pentecostals and Charismatic Christians numbered over 584 million or a quarter of the world 's 2 billion Christians in 2011 .",
