It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet . The Balkan languages , including Greek and Bulgarian , have also acquired a significant number of Arabic words through contact with Ottoman Turkish .",
  "/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet": "The ancient Aramaic alphabet was adapted from the Phoenician alphabet and became a distinct script by the 8th century BC . It was used to write the Aramaic language and had displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet , itself a derivative of the Phoenician alphabet , for the writing of Hebrew . The letters all represent consonants , some of which are also used as matres lectionis to indicate long vowels . The Aramaic alphabet is historically significant since virtually all modern Middle Eastern writing systems can be traced back to it as well as numerous non-Chinese writing systems of Central and East Asia . That is primarily from the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a lingua franca and the official language of the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires , and their successor , the Achaemenid Empire . Among the scripts in modern use , the Hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BC , with an identical letter inventory and , for the most part , nearly identical letter shapes . The Aramaic alphabet was an ancestor to the Nabataean alphabet and the later Arabic alphabet . Writing systems ( like the Aramaic one ) that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of matres lectionis or added diacritical signs , have been called abjads by Peter T. Daniels to distinguish them from alphabets , such as the Greek alphabet , which represent vowels more systematically . The term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet , which would imply that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary ( as argued by Ignace Gelb ) or an incomplete or deficient alphabet ( as most other writers have said ) . Rather , it is a different type .",

It is one of the Semitic abjads descending from the Aramaic alphabet through the Palmyrene alphabet , and shares similarities with the Phoenician , Hebrew , Arabic and the traditional Mongolian scripts . Syriac is written from right to left in horizontal lines . It is a cursive script where most - but not all - letters connect within a word . There is no letter case distinction between upper and lower case letters , though some letters change their form depending on their position within a word . Spaces separate individual words . All 22 letters are consonants , although there are optional diacritic marks to indicate vowels and other features . In addition to the sounds of the language , the letters of the Syriac alphabet can be used to represent numbers in a system similar to Hebrew and Greek numerals . Apart from Classical Syriac Aramaic , the alphabet has been used to write other dialects and languages . Several Christian Neo-Aramaic languages from Turoyo to the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects of Assyrian and Chaldean , once vernaculars , primarily began to be written in the 19th century . The Ser\u1e6d\u0101 variant specifically has recently been adapted to write Western Neo-Aramaic , traditionally written in a square Aramaic script closely related to the Hebrew alphabet . Besides Aramaic , when Arabic began to be the dominant spoken language in the Fertile Crescent after the Islamic conquest , texts were often written in Arabic using the Syriac script as knowledge of the Arabic alphabet was not yet widespread ; such writings are usually called Karshuni or Garshuni ( \u0713\u072a\u072b\u0718\u0722\u071d ) .",

It is considered an Arabic-derived African writing system . Since African languages involve phonetic sounds and systems different from the Arabic language , there have often been adaptations of the Arabic script to transcribe them , a process similar to what has been done with the Arabic script in non-Arab countries of the Middle East and South Asia and with the Latin script in Africa or with the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet . The West African Hausa is an example of a language written using Ajami , especially during the pre-colonial period when Qur'anic schools taught Muslim children Arabic , and by extension , Ajami . When Western colonizers adopted a Latin orthography for Hausa , Ajami went into decline and now is employed less frequently than the Latin standard orthography . However , Hausa Ajami is still in widespread use , especially in Islamic circles . Its use is often in a situation of digraphia , with Ajami used for specific purposes , such as for local herbal preparations in the Jula language .",

Comorian , spoken in the Comoros Islands , is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Swahili , though other authorities consider it a distinct language . The exact number of Swahili speakers , be it native or second-language speakers , is unknown and a matter of debate . Various estimates have been put forward and they vary widely , ranging from 100 million to 150 million . Swahili serves as a national language of the DRC , Kenya , Tanzania , and Uganda . Shikomor , the official language in Comoros and also spoken in Mayotte ( Shimaore ) , is related to Swahili . Swahili is also one of the working languages of the African Union and officially recognised as a lingua franca of the East African Community . In 2018 , South Africa legalized the teaching of Swahili in South African schools as an optional subject to begin in 2020 . A significant fraction of Swahili vocabulary derives from Arabic , in part conveyed by Arabic-speaking Muslim inhabitants . For example , the Swahili word for book is kitabu , traceable back to the Arabic word \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 kit\u0101b ( from the root K-T-B write ) . However , the Swahili plural form of this word ( books ) is vitabu , rather than the Arabic plural form \u0643\u062a\u0628 kutub , following the Bantu grammar in which ki- is reanalysed as a nominal class prefix , whose plural is vi- .",

In 1940 due to general Soviet policy , a Cyrillic alphabet eventually became common and has remained so to this day , though some Kyrgyz still use the Arabic alphabet . When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 , there was a popular idea among some Kyrgyzstanis to switch to the Latin script , which is still common in some small pockets of the countryside and make the Latin script the countrys official national script ( taking in mind a version closer to the Turkish alphabet rather than the original alphabet of 1928-40 ) .

The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 .

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",
