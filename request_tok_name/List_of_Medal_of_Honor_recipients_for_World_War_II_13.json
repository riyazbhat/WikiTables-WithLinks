  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived .",
  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",

  "/wiki/Edward_O'Hare": "Lieutenant Commander Edward Henry Butch O'Hare ( March 13 , 1914 - November 26 , 1943 ) was an American naval aviator of the United States Navy , who on February 20 , 1942 , became the Navy 's first flying ace when he single-handedly attacked a formation of nine heavy bombers approaching his aircraft carrier . Even though he had a limited amount of ammunition , he managed to shoot down five enemy bombers . On April 21 , 1942 , he became the first naval recipient of the Medal of Honor in World War II . O'Hare 's final action took place on the night of November 26 , 1943 , while he was leading the U.S. Navy 's first-ever nighttime fighter attack launched from an aircraft carrier . During this encounter with a group of Japanese torpedo bombers , O'Hare 's Grumman F6F Hellcat was shot down ; his aircraft was never found . In 1945 , the U.S. Navy destroyer USS O'Hare ( DD-889 ) was named in his honor . A few years later , Colonel Robert R. McCormick , publisher of the Chicago Tribune , suggested that the name of Chicago 's Orchard Depot Airport be changed as a tribute to Butch O'Hare . On September 19 , 1949 , the Chicago , Illinois airport was renamed O'Hare International Airport to honor O'Hare 's bravery . The airport displays a Grumman F4F-3 museum aircraft replicating the one flown by Butch O'Hare during his Medal of Honor flight . The Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat on display was recovered virtually intact from the bottom of Lake Michigan , where it sank after a training accident in 1943 when it went off the training aircraft carrier USS Wolverine ( IX-64 ) . In 2001 , the Air Classics Museum remodeled the aircraft to replicate the F4F-3 Wildcat that O'Hare flew on his Medal of Honor flight . The restored Wildcat is exhibited in the west end of Terminal 2 behind the security checkpoint to honor O'Hare International Airport 's namesake .",

Operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and covering some 7,627 acres ( 3,087 ha ) , O'Hare has non-stop flights to 228 destinations in North America , South America , Europe , Africa , Asia and Oceania . Designed to be the successor to Chicago 's busiest square mile in the world , Midway Airport , O'Hare began as an airfield serving a Douglas manufacturing plant for C-54 military transports during World War II . It was named for Edward Butch O'Hare , the U.S. Navy 's first Medal of Honor recipient during that war . Later , at the height of the Cold War , O'Hare served as an active fighter base for the Air Force . As the first major airport planned after World War II , O'Hare 's innovative design pioneered concepts such as concourses , direct highway access to the terminal , jet bridges , and underground refueling systems . It became famous as the first World 's Busiest Airport of the jet age , holding that distinction from 1963 to 1998 ; today , it is the world 's sixth-busiest airport , serving 83 million passengers in 2018 . In the year ending December 31 , 2018 , O'Hare had 903,747 aircraft operations , averaging 2,474 per day , the most of any airport in the world . O'Hare is unusual in that it serves as a major hub for more than one of the three U.S. mainline carriers ; it is a large hub for both United Airlines ( which is headquartered in Chicago ) and American Airlines . It is also a focus city for Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines . While Terminals 2 and 3 remain of the original design , the airfield has seen radical modernization , and an expansion of passenger facilities in the terminal complex began in 2020 , which will remake it as North America 's first airport built around airline alliances .",

Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone .

In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major .

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .
