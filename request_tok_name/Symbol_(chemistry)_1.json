  "/wiki/Actinium": "Actinium is a chemical element with the symbol Ac and atomic number 89 . It was first isolated by French chemist Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne in 1899 . Friedrich Oskar Giesel later independently isolated it in 1902 and , unaware that it was already known , gave it the name emanium . Actinium gave the name to the actinide series , a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table . It is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th-period transition metals , although lawrencium is less commonly given that position . Together with polonium , radium , and radon , actinium was one of the first non-primordial radioactive elements to be isolated . A soft , silvery-white radioactive metal , actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation . As with most lanthanides and many actinides , actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds . Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac , which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years , predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles , and 228Ac , which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours . One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227 , and one tonne of thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228 . The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical . Instead , the element is prepared , in milligram amounts , by the neutron irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reactor .",
  "/wiki/Ray_(optics)": "In optics a ray is an idealized model of light , obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wavefronts of the actual light , and that points in the direction of energy flow . Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system , by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing . This allows even very complex optical systems to be analyzed mathematically or simulated by computer . Ray tracing uses approximate solutions to Maxwell 's equations that are valid as long as the light waves propagate through and around objects whose dimensions are much greater than the light 's wavelength . Ray theory ( geometrical optics ) does not describe phenomena such as diffraction , which require wave theory . Some wave phenomena such as interference can be modeled in limited circumstances by adding phase to the ray model .",
  "/wiki/Polonium": "Polonium is a chemical element with the symbol Po and atomic number 84 . A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes , polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium , though its metallic character resembles that of its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table : thallium , lead , and bismuth . Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes , its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 ( with a half-life of 138 days ) in uranium ores , as it is the penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238 . Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist , they are much more difficult to produce . Today , polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth . Due to its intense radioactivity , which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating , its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only . Polonium was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie , when it was extracted from the uranium ore pitchblende and identified solely by its strong radioactivity : it was the first element to be so discovered . Polonium was named after Marie Curie 's homeland of Poland . Polonium has few applications , and those are related to its radioactivity : heaters in space probes , antistatic devices , sources of neutrons and alpha particles , and poison . It is a radioactive element and extremely dangerous to humans .",
  "/wiki/Lead": "Lead ( /\u02c8l\u025bd/ ) is a chemical element with the symbol Pb ( from the Latin plumbum ) and atomic number 82 . It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials . Lead is soft and malleable , and also has a relatively low melting point . When freshly cut , lead is silvery with a hint of blue ; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air . Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements . Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal . Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature ; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases , and it tends to form covalent bonds . Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group . Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds . Like the lighter members of the group , lead tends to bond with itself ; it can form chains and polyhedral structures . Lead is easily extracted from its ores ; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it . Galena , a principal ore of lead , often bears silver , interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome .",
  "/wiki/Bismuth": "Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83 . It is a pentavalent post-transition metal and one of the pnictogens with chemical properties resembling its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony . Elemental bismuth may occur naturally , although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores . The free element is 86% as dense as lead . It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced , but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge . Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element , and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals . Bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable , but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive : its only primordial isotope , bismuth-209 , decays via alpha decay with a half-life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe . Because of its tremendously long half-life , bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes .",

  "/wiki/Thallium": "Thallium is a chemical element with the symbol Tl and atomic number 81 . It is a gray post-transition metal that is not found free in nature . When isolated , thallium resembles tin , but discolors when exposed to air . Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861 , in residues of sulfuric acid production . Both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy , in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line . Thallium , from Greek \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 , thall\u00f3s , meaning a green shoot or twig , was named by Crookes . It was isolated by both Lamy and Crookes in 1862 ; Lamy by electrolysis , and Crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder . Crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by zinc at the International exhibition , which opened on 1 May that year . Thallium tends to form the +3 and +1 oxidation states . The +3 state resembles that of the other elements in group 13 ( boron , aluminium , gallium , indium ) . However , the +1 state , which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it , recalls the chemistry of alkali metals , and thallium ( I ) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores , and ( when ingested ) are handled in many ways like potassium ions ( K+ ) by ion pumps in living cells . Commercially , thallium is produced not from potassium ores , but as a byproduct from refining of heavy-metal sulfide ores .",
  "/wiki/Francium": "Francium is a chemical element with the symbol Fr and atomic number 87 . Prior to its discovery , it was referred to as eka-caesium . It is extremely radioactive ; its most stable isotope , francium-223 ( originally called actinium K after the natural decay chain it appears in ) , has a half-life of only 22 minutes . It is the second-most electropositive element , behind only caesium , and is the second rarest naturally occurring element ( after astatine ) . The isotopes of francium decay quickly into astatine , radium , and radon . The electronic structure of a francium atom is [ Rn ] 7s1 , and so the element is classed as an alkali metal . Bulk francium has never been viewed . Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column , it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal , if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid . Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable , since the extreme heat of decay caused by its short half-life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element . Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France ( from which the element takes its name ) in 1939 . It was the last element first discovered in nature , rather than by synthesis . [ note 1 ] Outside the laboratory , francium is extremely rare , with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores , where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays .",
  "/wiki/Uranium": "Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable ; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements . Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite . In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739-99.2752% ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198-0.7202% ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050-0.0059% ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth . Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties .",
  "/wiki/Radium": "Radium is a chemical element with the symbol Ra and atomic number 88 . It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table , also known as the alkaline earth metals . Pure radium is silvery-white , but it readily reacts with nitrogen ( rather than oxygen ) on exposure to air , forming a black surface layer of radium nitride ( Ra3N2 ) . All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive , with the most stable isotope being radium-226 , which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas ( specifically the isotope radon-222 ) . When radium decays , ionizing radiation is a product , which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence . Radium , in the form of radium chloride , was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 . They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later . Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1911 . In nature , radium is found in uranium and ( to a lesser extent ) thorium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite . Radium is not necessary for living organisms , and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity . Currently , other than its use in nuclear medicine , radium has no commercial applications ; formerly , it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers . Today , these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium 's toxicity has become known , and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices .",

  "/wiki/Deuterium": "Deuterium ( or hydrogen-2 , symbol 2H or D , also known as heavy hydrogen ) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen ( the other being protium , or hydrogen-1 ) . The nucleus of a deuterium atom , called a deuteron , contains one proton and one neutron , whereas the far more common protium has no neutrons in the nucleus . Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth 's oceans of about one atom in 6420 of hydrogen . Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.02% ( 0.03% by mass ) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans , while protium accounts for more than 99.98% . The abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to another ( see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ) . The name deuterium is derived from the Greek deuteros , meaning second , to denote the two particles composing the nucleus . Deuterium was discovered and named in 1931 by Harold Urey . When the neutron was discovered in 1932 , this made the nuclear structure of deuterium obvious , and Urey won the Nobel Prize in 1934 for his discovery of heavy hydrogen . Soon after deuterium 's discovery , Urey and others produced samples of heavy water in which the deuterium content had been highly concentrated . Deuterium is destroyed in the interiors of stars faster than it is produced . Other natural processes are thought to produce only an insignificant amount of deuterium . Nearly all deuterium found in nature was produced in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago , as the basic or primordial ratio of hydrogen-1 to deuterium ( about 26 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogen atoms ) has its origin from that time .",

  "/wiki/Ionium": "Thorium ( 90Th ) has seven naturally occurring isotopes but none are stable . One isotope , 232Th , is relatively stable , with a half-life of 1.405\u00d71010 years , considerably longer than the age of the Earth , and even slightly longer than the generally accepted age of the universe . This isotope makes up nearly all natural thorium , so thorium was considered to be mononuclidic . However , in 2013 , IUPAC reclassified thorium as binuclidic , due to large amounts of 230Th in deep seawater . Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition and thus a standard atomic weight can be given . Thirty-one radioisotopes have been characterized , with the most stable being 232Th , 230Th with a half-life of 75,380 years , 229Th with a half-life of 7,917 years , and 228Th with a half-life of 1.92 years . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes . One isotope , 229Th , has a nuclear isomer ( or metastable state ) with a remarkably low excitation energy , recently measured to be 8.28 \u00b1 0.17 eV . It has been proposed to perform laser spectroscopy of the 229Th nucleus and use the low-energy transition for the development of a nuclear clock of extremely high accuracy .

  "/wiki/Thorium": "Thorium is a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element with the symbol Th and atomic number 90 . Thorium is silvery and tarnishes black when it is exposed to air , forming thorium dioxide ; it is moderately hard , malleable , and has a high melting point . Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation state ; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided . All known thorium isotopes are unstable . The most stable isotope , 232Th , has a half-life of 14.05 billion years , or about the age of the universe ; it decays very slowly via alpha decay , starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb . On Earth , thorium , bismuth , and uranium are the only three radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements . [ a ] It is estimated to be over three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth 's crust , and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth metals . Thorium was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius , who named it after Thor , the Norse god of thunder . Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century . Thorium 's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century . In the second half of the century , thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactivity . Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions .",
  "/wiki/Protactinium": "Protactinium ( formerly protoactinium ) is a chemical element with the symbol Pa and atomic number 91 . It is a dense , silvery-gray actinide metal which readily reacts with oxygen , water vapor and inorganic acids . It forms various chemical compounds in which protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state +5 , but it can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states . Concentrations of protactinium in the Earth 's crust are typically a few parts per trillion , but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits . Because of its scarcity , high radioactivity and high toxicity , there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research , and for this purpose , protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel . Protactinium was first identified in 1913 by Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth G\u00f6hring and named brevium because of the short half-life of the specific isotope studied , i.e . protactinium-234 . A more stable isotope of protactinium , 231Pa , was discovered in 1917/18 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner , and they chose the name proto-actinium , but the IUPAC finally named it protactinium in 1949 and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers . The new name meant ( nuclear ) precursor of actinium and reflected that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium . John Arnold Cranston ( working with Frederick Soddy and Ada Hitchins ) is also credited with discovering the most stable isotope in 1915 , but delayed his announcement due to being called up for service in the First World War . The longest-lived and most abundant ( nearly 100% ) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium , protactinium-231 , has a half-life of 32,760 years and is a decay product of uranium-235 .
