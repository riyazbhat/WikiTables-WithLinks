Formerly a river settlement inhabited by the Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy , Utica attracted European-American settlers from New England during and after the American Revolution . In the 19th century , immigrants strengthened its position as a layover city between Albany and Syracuse on the Erie and Chenango Canals and the New York Central Railroad . During the 19th and 20th centuries , the city 's infrastructure contributed to its success as a manufacturing center and defined its role as a worldwide hub for the textile industry . Utica 's 20th-century political corruption and organized crime gave it the nickname Sin City . Like other Rust Belt cities , Utica underwent an economic downturn beginning in the mid-20th century . The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills , population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse , and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a depressed tax base . With its low cost of living , the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world , encouraging growth for its colleges and universities , cultural institutions and economy .",
