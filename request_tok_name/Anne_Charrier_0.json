Viola ( who is disguised as Cesario ) falls in love with Duke Orsino , who in turn is in love with Countess Olivia . Upon meeting Viola , Countess Olivia falls in love with her thinking she is a man . The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion , with plot elements drawn from the short story Of Apollonius and Silla by Barnabe Rich , based on a story by Matteo Bandello . The first recorded public performance was on 2 February 1602 , at Candlemas , the formal end of Christmastide in the year 's calendar . The play was not published until its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio .",
  "/wiki/William_Shakespeare": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616 ) [ a ] was an English poet , playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",
