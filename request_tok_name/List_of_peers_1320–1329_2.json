  "/wiki/Baron_Kingsale": "Baron Kingsale is a title in the Peerage of Ireland , that of the premier baron in that peerage . The feudal barony dates to at least the thirteenth century . The first peerage creation was by writ . The numbering of the barons varies , some sources including the holders of the feudal barony , others commencing with the peers from 1340 , and still others from 1397 ; a licence of that year issued to the fourth peer has often been mistaken for a patent creating the peerage , but this is not the case . This article follows the numbering of The Complete Peerage . The Baron also holds the feudal titles of Lord Courcy and Lord Ringrone , probably created in the twelfth century . Several sources claim that the Baron holds the privilege of being covered ( that is , wearing a hat ) in the presence of the monarch . The Eleventh Edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica , however , disagrees , claiming that the story is a legend without historic foundation . Despite the antiquity of the title , the family no longer retains its property or wealth , having supported the losing side in past conflicts ; the 30th ( or 35th ) Baron , despite education at Stowe and the Universities of Paris and Salzburg due to his father 's marriage to the daughter of a Yorkshire lanolin oil business , was , due to the failure of that business , amongst other things , an odd-job man and plumber , and died a resident of sheltered housing .",
