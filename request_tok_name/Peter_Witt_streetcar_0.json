The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native American Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers . The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration , the construction of the Erie Canal and rail transportation , and its close proximity to Lake Erie . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States while grooming its economy for the grain , steel and automobile industries that dominated the city 's economy in the 20th century . Since the city 's economy relied heavily on manufacturing , deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population . While some manufacturing activity remains , Buffalo 's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare , research and higher education , which emerged following the Great Recession . Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie , at the head of the Niagara River , 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Niagara Falls . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light .

It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837 , and named Melbourne by Governor General Richard Bourke on 10 April 1837 in honour of the British Prime Minister , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne . In 1851 , four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city , Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria . In the wake of the 1850s Victorian gold rush , the city entered a lengthy boom period that , by the late 1880s , had transformed it into one of the world 's largest and wealthiest metropolises . After the federation of Australia in 1901 , it served as interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927 .

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

  "/wiki/New_York_State_Railways": "New York State Railways was a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad that controlled several large city streetcar and electric interurban systems in upstate New York . It included the city transit lines in Rochester , Syracuse , Utica , Oneida and Rome , plus various interurban lines connecting those cities . New York State Railways also held a 50% interest in the Schenectady Railway Company , but it remained a separate independent operation . The New York Central took control of the Rochester Railway Company , the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway and the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway in 1905 , and the Mohawk Valley Company was formed by the railroad to manage these new acquisitions . New York State Railways was formed in 1909 when the properties controlled by the Mohawk Valley Company were merged . In 1912 it added the Rochester and Suburban Railway , the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway , the Oneida Railway , and the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway . The New York Central Railroad was interested in acquiring these lines in an effort to control the competition and to gain control of the lucrative electric utility companies that were behind many of these streetcar and interurban railways . Ridership across the system dropped through the 1920s as operating costs continued to rise , coupled with competition from better highways and private automobile use . New York Central sold New York State Railways in 1928 to a consortium led by investor E. L. Phillips , who was looking to gain control of the upstate utilities . Phillips sold his stake to Associated Gas & Electric in 1929 , and the new owners allowed the railway bonds to default . New York State Railways entered receivership on December 30 , 1929 . The company emerged from receivership in 1934 , and local operations were sold off to new private operators between 1938 and 1948 .",
