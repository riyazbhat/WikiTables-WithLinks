Arena is a multi-purpose arena in on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , United States . It is home to four Tar Heels athletic teams : women 's basketball , women 's volleyball , women 's gymnastics , and wrestling . The arena opened in 1965 as Carmichael Auditorium and is named for William Donald Carmichael , Jr. , a popular former school vice-president and brother of All-America basketball player Cartwright Carmichael . Although it was apparent by the early 1960s that the men 's basketball team needed a new home to replace 27-year-old Woollen Gymnasium , the state refused to fund a completely new arena . As a result , Carmichael was built as an annex to Woollen ; it shares the older facility 's eastern wall . It originally seated just over 8,800 people , but expansions over the years brought its final capacity to 10,180 by the time the men left for the Dean Smith Center in 1986 . In 1976 , the capacity was increased from 8,800 to 10,000 . In their last game at Carmichael , the North Carolina Tar Heels beat the North Carolina State Wolfpack 90-79 , to finish with a record of 169-20 at Carmichael . After a remodeling project completed in 2009 , capacity is 8,010 . Carmichael was known as one of the loudest arenas in the country while the Tar Heel men played there , largely because of a low roof and a student section that ringed the court . During a 1982 game against the Virginia Cavaliers , it was so loud that the Virginia players could not even hear their own names being announced prior to the start of the game .",

For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas ."
