The organizer was at that time the great political leader Alfonzo D\u00edaz Parra . This project lasted about a week , and ended up being called The Desnucadero . Nevertheless , it was until 1964 thanks to the famous brick march , led by the mayor elect of the time Guillermo Plazas Alcid and his right hand Senator D\u00edaz Parra , in addition in which students of college and common citizens participated , that the idea of having a soccer stadium was taking shape . The definitive construction was consolidated thanks to the donation of a piece of land in the La Libertad neighborhood by the Municipal Government for the designation of Neiva as the venue for the 1980 National Sports Games .

It grew into an important port , serving as a haven for immigrants from Europe , especially during and immediately following World War I and World War II , when waves of additional immigrants from the Middle East and Asia arrived . Barranquilla became Colombia 's principal port , and with its level of industrialization and modernity earned the city the nickname Colombia 's Golden Gate ( Spanish : La Puerta de Oro de Colombia ) . In the 1940s , Barranquilla was the second-largest city in Colombia and one of the most modern cities in the Caribbean and in South America ; later local administrations , due to widespread corruption in their ranks , brought about a decline in the standard of living . As government investment increased in other Colombian cities , Barranquilla 's national position was eclipsed .

Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order , with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia . It is the political , economic , administrative and industrial center of the country . Bogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on August 6 , 1538 , by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca . The Muisca were the indigenous inhabitants of the region , and they called the place of the foundation Thybzaca or Old Town . The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca Bacat\u00e1 ( or Mueket\u00e1 ) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota . There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacat\u00e1 , the most accepted being that it means walling of the farmland in the Chibcha language . Another popular translation argues that it means The Lady of the Andes . Further , the word 'Andes ' in the Aymara language means shining mountain , thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogot\u00e1 as The Lady of the shining mountain ( notice , however , that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha ) . Others suggest that Bacat\u00e1 was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived . Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of Our Lady of Hope but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santaf\u00e9 ( Holy Faith ) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city . Santaf\u00e9 became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada ( created in 1550 ) , and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada .",
