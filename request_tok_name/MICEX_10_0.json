  "/wiki/Precious_metal": "A precious metal is a very rare , naturally occurring metallic chemical element of high economic value . Chemically , the precious metals tend to be less reactive than most elements ( see noble metal ) . They are usually ductile and have a high lustre . Historically , precious metals were important as currency but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities . Gold , silver , platinum , and palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code . The best known precious metals are the coinage metals , which are gold and silver . Although both have industrial uses , they are better known for their uses in art , jewelry , and coinage . Other precious metals include the platinum group metals : ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , osmium , iridium , and platinum , of which platinum is the most widely traded . The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use but also by their role as investments and a store of value . Historically , precious metals have commanded much higher prices than common industrial metals .",
  "/wiki/Non-ferrous_metal": "In metallurgy , a non-ferrous metal is a metal , including alloys , that does not contain iron ( ferrite ) in appreciable amounts . Generally more costly than ferrous metals , non-ferrous metals are used because of desirable properties such as low weight ( e.g . aluminium ) , higher conductivity ( e.g . copper ) , non-magnetic property or resistance to corrosion ( e.g . zinc ) . Some non-ferrous materials are also used in the iron and steel industries . For example , bauxite is used as flux for blast furnaces , while others such as wolframite , pyrolusite and chromite are used in making ferrous alloys . Important non-ferrous metals include aluminium , copper , lead , nickel , tin , titanium and zinc , and alloys such as brass . Precious metals such as gold , silver and platinum and exotic or rare metals such as cobalt , mercury , tungsten , beryllium , bismuth , cerium , cadmium , niobium , indium , gallium , germanium , lithium , selenium , tantalum , tellurium , vanadium , and zirconium are also non-ferrous . They are usually obtained through minerals such as sulfides , carbonates , and silicates . Non-ferrous metals are usually refined through electrolysis .",
  "/wiki/Metallurgy": "Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements , their inter-metallic compounds , and their mixtures , which are called alloys . Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals . That is , the way in which science is applied to the production of metals , and the engineering of metal components used in products for both consumers and manufacturers . Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking . Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement . A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a Metallurgist . The science of metallurgy is subdivided into two broad categories : chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy . Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals , and the chemical performance of metals . Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing , the extraction of metals , thermodynamics , electrochemistry , and chemical degradation ( corrosion ) . In contrast , physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals , the physical properties of metals , and the physical performance of metals . Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography , material characterization , mechanical metallurgy , phase transformations , and failure mechanisms . Historically , metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals .",
  "/wiki/Common_stock": "Common stock is a form of corporate equity ownership , a type of security . The terms voting share and ordinary share are also used frequently in other parts of the world ; common stock being primarily used in the United States . They are known as equity shares or ordinary shares in the UK and other Commonwealth realms . This type of share gives the stockholder the right to share in the profits of the company , and to vote on matters of corporate policy and the composition of the members of the board of directors . This form of stock is called common because it does not involve ownership of particular corporate assets , but rather a concurrent interest in all of the assets . A corporation may issue both common and preferred stock , in which case the preferred stockholders have priority to receive dividends or to redeem their stock . In the event of liquidation , common stock investors receive any remaining funds after bondholders , creditors ( including employees ) , and preferred stockholders are paid . When the liquidation happens through bankruptcy , the common stock investors typically receive nothing . Common stockholders can also earn money through capital appreciation . Common shares may perform better than preferred shares or bonds over time , in part to accommodate the increased risk .",

  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",

  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",

  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries .

In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries .

  "/wiki/Retail": "Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit . Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain . The term retailer is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals , who are end-users , rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale , corporate or government clientele . Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products . Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods , including necessities such as food and clothing ; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity . Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing : it does not always result in a purchase . Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history , dating back to antiquity . Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers . Over the centuries , retail shops were transformed from little more than rude booths to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era . Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store , the market to be served , the optimal product assortment , customer service , supporting services and the store 's overall market positioning . Once the strategic retail plan is in place , retailers devise the retail mix which includes product , price , place , promotion , personnel , and presentation . In the digital age , an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels , including both bricks and mortar and online retailing .",
