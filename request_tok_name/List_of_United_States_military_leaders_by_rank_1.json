  "/wiki/William_Westmoreland": "William Childs Westmoreland ( March 26 , 1914 - July 18 , 2005 ) was a United States Army General , most notably commander of United States forces during the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1968 . He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972 . Westmoreland adopted a strategy of attrition against the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army , attempting to drain them of manpower and supplies . He also made use of the United States ' edge in artillery and air power , both in tactical confrontations and in relentless strategic bombing of North Vietnam . Many of the battles in Vietnam were technically United States victories , with the United States Army in control of the field afterward ; holding territory gained this way proved difficult , however . Public support for the war eventually diminished , especially after the Battle of Khe Sanh and the Tet Offensive in 1968 . By the time he was re-assigned as Army Chief of Staff , United States military forces in Vietnam had reached a peak of 535,000 personnel . Westmoreland 's strategy was ultimately politically unsuccessful . Growing United States casualties and the draft undermined United States support for the war , while large-scale casualties among non-combatants weakened South Vietnamese support . This also failed to weaken North Vietnam 's will to fight , and the Government of South Vietnam - a factor largely out of Westmoreland 's control - never succeeded in establishing enough legitimacy to quell defections to the Viet Cong .",
  "/wiki/General_(United_States)": "In the United States Army , United States Marine Corps , United States Air Force , and United States Space Force , general ( abbreviated as GEN in the Army or Gen in the Marine Corps , Air Force , and Space Force ) is a four-star general officer rank , with the pay grade of O-10 . General ranks above lieutenant general and below General of the Army or General of the Air Force ; the Marine Corps and Space Force does not have an established grade above general . General is equivalent to the rank of admiral in the other uniformed services . Since the grades of General of the Army and General of the Air Force are reserved for wartime use only , and since the Marine Corps has no five-star equivalent , the grade of general is the highest appointment an officer can achieve in peacetime .",

The conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh . [ A 4 ] Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954 , the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state . The Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng , also known as Front national de lib\u00e9ration du Sud-Vi\u00eat Nam or NLF ( the National Liberation Front ) , a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of North Vietnam , initiated a guerrilla war in the south .

  "/wiki/Hyman_G._Rickover": "Hyman G. Rickover ( January 27 , 1900 - July 8 , 1986 ) was an Admiral in the U.S. Navy . He directed the original development of naval nuclear propulsion and controlled its operations for three decades as director of the U.S . Naval Reactors office . In addition , he oversaw the development of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station , the world 's first commercial pressurized water reactor used for generating electricity . Rickover is known as the Father of the Nuclear Navy , and his influence on the Navy and its warships was of such scope that he may well go down in history as one of the Navy 's most important officers . He served in a flag rank for nearly 30 years ( 1953 to 1982 ) , ending his career as a four-star admiral . His years of service exceeded that of each of the U.S. Navy 's five-star fleet admirals - Leahy , King , Nimitz and Halsey - all of whom served on active duty for life after their appointments . Rickover 's total of 63 years of active duty service make him the longest-serving naval officer , as well as the longest-serving member of the U.S armed forces in history . Rickover is one of four people who have been awarded two Congressional Gold Medals . His substantial legacy of technical achievements includes the United States Navy 's continuing record of zero reactor accidents , defined as the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment subsequent to reactor core damage .",
  "/wiki/Admiral_(United_States)": "Admiral ( abbreviated as ADM ) is a four-star commissioned naval flag officer rank in the United States Navy , the United States Coast Guard , and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps , with the pay grade of O-10 . Admiral ranks above vice admiral and below fleet admiral in the Navy ; the Coast Guard and the Public Health Service do not have an established grade above admiral . Admiral is equivalent to the rank of general in the other uniformed services . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps has never had an officer hold the grade of admiral . However , 37 U.S.C . \u00a7 201 of the U.S. Code established the grade for the NOAA Corps , in case a position is created that merits the four-star grade . Since the five-star grade of fleet admiral has not been used since 1946 , the grade of admiral is effectively the highest appointment an officer can achieve in the United States Navy , the United States Coast Guard , and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps .",

The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War , First Gulf War , Gulf War I , Kuwait War , First Iraq War or Iraq War , [ a ] before the term Iraq War became identified instead with the post-2003 Iraq War . The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board US bombers during Operation Desert Storm . On 2 August 1990 the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait , which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council . Together with the UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher , American President George H. W. Bush deployed US forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene . An array of nations joined the coalition , forming the largest military alliance since World War II . The great majority of the coalition 's military forces were from the US , with Saudi Arabia , the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors , in that order . Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US $ 32 billion of the US $ 60 billion cost . The war marked the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle , principally by the US network CNN .

  "/wiki/War_on_Terror": "The war on terror , also known as the Global War on Terrorism , is an international military campaign launched by the United States government after the September 11 attacks . The targets of the campaign are primarily Sunni Islamist fundamentalist armed groups located throughout the Muslim world , with the most prominent groups being Al-Qaeda , the Islamic State , the Taliban , Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan , and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations . The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined . U.S. president George W. Bush first used the term war on terrorism on 16 September 2001 , and then war on terror a few days later in a formal speech to Congress . In the latter speech , George Bush stated , Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them . The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with al-Qaeda . The term was immediately criticised by such people as Richard B. Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and more nuanced terms subsequently came to be used by the Bush administration to publicly define the international campaign led by the U.S . It was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations in internal government documentation . There was a medal issued in the name of terrorism , however , the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal . U.S. President Barack Obama announced on 23 May 2013 that the Global War on Terror was over , saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S. On 28 December 2014 , the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan . However , the unexpected [ citation needed ] rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) terror group - also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) - led to a new operation against terror in the Middle East and South Asia , Operation Inherent Resolve . Criticism of the war on terror focused on morality , efficiency , and economics ; some , including later president Barack Obama , objected to the phrase itself as a misnomer .",

  "/wiki/Iraq_War": "The Iraq War [ nb 1 ] was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein . The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government . An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 Iraqis were killed in the first three to four years of conflict . US troops were officially withdrawn in 2009 but are still fighting in Iraq , most of them having been redeployed following the spread of the Syrian Civil War and the territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . Many former soldiers are employed by defence contractors and private military companies . The U.S. became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition ; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue . The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration 's War on Terror , following the September 11 attacks . In October 2002 , Congress authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq should he choose to . The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003 , when the U.S. , joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies , launched a shock and awe bombing campaign . Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S.-led forces swept through the country . The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government ; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later . The power vacuum following Saddam 's demise and the mismanagement of the Coalition Provisional Authority led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis , as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces .",

It was led by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines against the Iraqi insurgents in the city of Fallujah and was authorized by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Interim Government . The U.S. military called it some of the heaviest urban combat U.S. Marines and Soldiers have been involved in since the Battle of Hu\u1ebf City in Vietnam in 1968 . This operation was the second major operation in Fallujah . Earlier , in April 2004 , coalition forces fought the First Battle of Fallujah in order to capture or kill insurgent elements considered responsible for the deaths of a Blackwater Security team . When coalition forces fought into the center of the city , the Iraqi government requested that the city 's control be transferred to an Iraqi-run local security force , which then began stockpiling weapons and building complex defenses across the city through mid-2004 . The second battle was the bloodiest battle of the entire Iraq War , and is notable for being the first major engagement of the Iraq War fought solely against insurgents rather than the forces of the former Ba'athist Iraqi government , which was deposed in 2003 .",
