  "/wiki/Vinson_Massif": "Vinson Massif ( /\u02c8v\u026ans\u0259n m\u00e6\u02c8si\u02d0f/ ) is a large mountain massif in Antarctica that is 21 km ( 13 mi ) long and 13 km ( 8.1 mi ) wide and lies within the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains . It overlooks the Ronne Ice Shelf near the base of the Antarctic Peninsula . The massif is located about 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) from the South Pole . Vinson Massif was discovered in January 1958 by U.S. Navy aircraft . In 1961 , the Vinson Massif was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names ( US-ACAN ) , after Carl G. Vinson , United States congressman from the state of Georgia , for his support for Antarctic exploration . On November 1 , 2006 , US-ACAN declared Mount Vinson and Vinson Massif to be separate entities . Mount Vinson is the highest peak in Antarctica , at 4,892 metres ( 16,050 ft ) . It lies in the north part of Vinson Massif 's summit plateau in the south portion of the main ridge of the Sentinel Range about 2 kilometres ( 1.2 mi ) north of Hollister Peak . It was first climbed in 1966 by an American team led by Nicholas Clinch . An expedition in 2001 was the first to climb via the Eastern route , and also took GPS measurements of the height of the peak . As of February 2010 , 1,400 climbers have attempted to reach the top of Mount Vinson .",

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere , almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle , and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean . At 14,200,000 square kilometres ( 5,500,000 square miles ) , it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia . At 0.00008 people per square kilometre , it is by far the least densely populated continent . About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km ( 1.2 mi ; 6,200 ft ) in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula . Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Most of Antarctica is a polar desert , with annual precipitation of 200 mm ( 7.9 in ) along the coast and far less inland ; there has been no rain there for almost 2 million years , yet 80% of the world freshwater reserves are stored there . The temperature in Antarctica has reached \u221289.2 \u00b0C ( \u2212128.6 \u00b0F ) ( or even \u221294.7 \u00b0C ( \u2212135.8 \u00b0F ) as measured from space ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is \u221263 \u00b0C ( \u221281 \u00b0F ) . Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at research stations scattered across the continent . Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra . Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered , unseen until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf .",

Its youthful appearance strongly suggests that it last erupted in the Holocene . It is capped by a 4-by-5-kilometre ( 2.5 mi \u00d7 3.1 mi ) summit caldera , and tuff cones lie on the lower flanks . Recely Bluff is on the northeast slope of the mountain , about 7 nautical miles ( 13 km ) from the peak . Its volume of 1,800 cubic kilometres ( 430 cu mi ) is comparable to that of Mount Erebus . Mount Siple is named after Paul A. Siple ( 1908-68 ) , a US Antarctic explorer and geographer who took part in six Antarctic expeditions , including the two Byrd expeditions of 1928-30 and 1933-35 ( Siple Coast , Siple Island ) . He was in command of the West Base of the US Antarctic Service ( USAS ) , 1939-41 , and was navigator on all major exploratory flights from the base , including the flight on which Mount Siple was discovered . The mountain has no known record of being climbed . If it is in fact unclimbed , it is one of the most prominent unclimbed mountains in the world ( see highest unclimbed mountain ) . It receives very little publicity due to its remote location , and its topography has only been recorded by a sketch map . It has received fewer visits than many of its neighboring volcanoes .
