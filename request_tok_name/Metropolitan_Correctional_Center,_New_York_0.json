Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting .",

  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",

He is considered to have been the most powerful drug trafficker in the world . Guzm\u00e1n was born in Sinaloa and raised in a poor farming family . He endured physical abuse at the hands of his father , and also entered the drug trade through his father , helping him grow marijuana for local dealers during his early adulthood . Guzm\u00e1n began working with H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar by the late 1970s , one of the nation 's rising drug lords .

He achieved this by pioneering the use of distribution cells and long-range tunnels near borders , which enabled him to export more drugs to the United States than any other trafficker in history . Guzm\u00e1n 's leadership of the cartel also brought immense wealth and power ; Forbes ranked him as one of the most powerful people in the world between 2009 and 2013 , while the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) estimated that he matched the influence and wealth of Pablo Escobar .

Pursuant to its anti-bribery purpose , the FCPA amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require all companies with securities listed in the U.S. to meet certain accounting provisions , such as ensuring accurate and transparent financial records and maintaining internal accounting controls . The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , which apply criminal and civil penalties , respectively . Since its passage , the FCPA has been subject to controversy and criticism , namely whether its enforcement discourages U.S. companies from investing abroad .
