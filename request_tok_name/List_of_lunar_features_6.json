  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

  "/wiki/Abulfeda_(crater)": "Abulfeda is a lunar impact crater located in the central highlands of the Moon . To the northeast is the crater Descartes , and to the south-southeast is Almanon . To the north is the crater Dollond . A chain of craters named the Catena Abulfeda runs between the southern rim of Abulfeda and the north rim of Almanon , then continues for a length of 210 kilometers across the Rupes Altai . The crater was named for 14th century Syrian-born Kurdish historian Ismael Abul-fida . Both the south and northeast sides of the crater rim are overlain by multiple small craterlets . The inner wall is noticeably wider in the east , and shallow and worn to the north . The crater floor has been resurfaced , either by ejecta from the Mare Imbrium or by basaltic lava , and is relatively smooth and featureless . The crater lacks a central rise at the midpoint , which may have been buried . The inner sides appear to have been somewhat smoothed down , most likely as a result of minor bombardment and seismic shaking from other impacts in the vicinity .",

  "/wiki/Artamonov_(crater)": "Artamonov is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon . The eroded outer rim of Artamonov does not have the circular shape of most lunar craters , and instead has the overall shape of three or four merged craters . The largest of these formations is in the south , with smaller circular bulges to the north and east . The interior floor of Artamonov has been resurfaced by subsequent flows of basaltic lava , leaving a relatively flat , featureless floor that appears darker due to lower albedo . The crater floor is faintly marked by lighter-hued ejecta from the crater Giordano Bruno to the north . A linear formation of craters designated Catena Artamonov lies alongside the northeast rim of Artamov , following a course to the southeast . Nearby craters of note include Maxwell and Lomonosov to the northwest , and Edison to the west . To the east-northeast is the smaller crater Espin , while the small Malyy formation is located to the south-southeast . The name of the crater was approved by the IAU in 1970 .",
  "/wiki/French_language": "French ( le fran\u00e7ais [ l\u0259 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b ] or la langue fran\u00e7aise [ la l\u0251\u0303\u0261 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z ] ) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family . It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",

It was the de facto language of the Soviet Union until its dissolution on 25 December 1991 . Although nearly three decades have passed since the breakup of the Soviet Union , Russian is used in official capacity or in public life in all the post-Soviet nation-states , as well as in Israel and Mongolia . Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages , one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages , and part of the larger Balto-Slavic branch . Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onward . Russian is the largest native language in Europe and the most geographically widespread language in Eurasia . It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages , with 144 million speakers in Russia , Ukraine and Belarus . Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the seventh by total number of speakers . The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations . Russian is also the second most widespread language on the Internet , after English . Russian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without , the so-called soft and hard sounds ."
