  "/wiki/Capital_(political)": "A capital or capital city is the municipality exercising primary status in a country , state , province , or other administrative region , usually as its seat of government . A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government 's offices and meeting places ; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution . In some jurisdictions , including several countries , the different branches of government are located in different settlements . In some cases , a distinction is made between the official ( constitutional ) capital and the seat of government , which is in another place . Capital cities that also serve as the prime economic , population , cultural , or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as primate cities . Examples are Athens , Bangkok , Brussels , Copenhagen , Cairo , London , Mexico City , Paris , Lima , Seoul and Tokyo . News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there , as a form of metonymy . For example , relations between Washington and London refer to relations between the United States and the United Kingdom .",

An Information Circular from the U.S. Department of the Interior , Bureau of Mines , from the same year specified that it used NA to indicate that information was not available and NAp to indicate that a category information was Not applicable . In the early years of computer programming , computerized forms that required fields to be filled in could cause problems where the field was one for which no answer would be applicable to certain persons filling out the form .

Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic hurricane belt . Its capital and largest city is Bridgetown .

The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536 , but later abandoned it in 1620 ; with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited , and to replenish their water supply . An English ship , the Olive Blossom , arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625 ; its men took possession of it in the name of King James I . In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English and later British colony .

Although it was deemed the property of the King of Spain , there are no records to suggest the Spanish ever landed or settled on the island . Following several unsuccessful attempts by Europeans to colonise the island due to resistance from the Island Caribs , French settlement and colonisation began in 1650 and continued for the next century .

  "/wiki/Parishes_of_Grenada": "The Caribbean island country of Grenada is divided into regions known as parishes . A parish defines a territorial unit or region that , historically , was usually an area under the pastoral care served by a local church as an ecclesiastical administrative unit ( see Parish ) and later used by map-makers to set boundaries to an area of land . Traditionally a settlement or village would centre on a church and later grow to become a town and then even a city . Therefore , a parish has now come to mean an administrative division and is used so by several countries as the smallest unit ( or lowest tier ) of local government . The differing size and shape of each parish was primarily influenced by the island 's earlier history and land that was granted to the first settlers that claimed that territory during the colonial years of the island . Two decades after Barbados was settled the French governor of Martinique , Jacques Dyel du Parquet , purchased Grenada from a French company and in 1650 established a settlement at what was to be Fort Royal in the parish of the low lands ( Ville Ft. Royal situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Paroisse de la Basse Terre ) . During this time the parish boundaries where laid out . The French cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin ( 1703-1772 ) draw several editions of a chart of the island of Grenada showing the earlier French parish divisions and was published as Carte de L'Isle de la Grenade in Paris 1756 . However , by 1763 the island was under British rule and a later map of the Island of Grenada showing towns and villages and division of the island into quarters in English by cartographer Bryon Edwards ( for J. Cooke 's History of the West Indies ) was engraved in 1818 . After a century the French capitulated to the British and formally ceded the island to Britain in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris . The English took over the churches and , as was traditional , chaples of ease and local churches were elevated to parish church status across the island , leading to the formation of new parishes surrounding those newly named churches . The six boundaries or borders of these parishes having already been well established in the mindset of the people then living simply took on the names of these churches .",
