The team has been coached by some of the best-known coaches in football history , including John Heisman , Greasy Neale , and Andy Kerr . Founded in 1890 , the team quickly became well known for drawing large crowds and defeating a number of prominent football teams . The faculty and administration expressed concern over the strength of the team and made efforts to reduce the influence of professionalism on the players . During the 1910s , some sportswriters suggested that the Presidents were one of the top teams in the nation . The greatest achievement in the team 's history was in 1921 , when the Presidents appeared in the 1922 Rose Bowl , playing the heavily favored California Golden Bears to a scoreless tie . The Red and Black finished the season with a share of the 1921 national championship , as named by the Boand System . As college football evolved in the 1930s and 1940s , the Presidents fell far behind their larger competitors , who were able to offer scholarships for their players .",

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

The National Football League was established on September 17 , 1920 , as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) . The APFA changed its name in 1922 to the National Football League , which it has retained ever since . From 1921 to 1931 , the APFA/NFL determined its champion by overall win-loss record , with no playoff games ; ties were not counted in the winning percentage total . The APFA did not keep records of the 1920 season ; they declared the Akron Pros , who finished the season with an 8-0-3 ( 8 wins , 0 losses , 3 ties ) record , as the league 's first champions by a vote of the owners . The Canton Bulldogs won two straight championships from 1922 to 1923 , and the Green Bay Packers won three in a row from 1929 to 1931 . The 1932 NFL season resulted in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans , and could not be resolved by the typical win-loss system . To settle the tie , a playoff game was played ; Chicago won the game and the championship . The following year , the NFL split into two divisions , and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game . In 1967 , the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge , effective following the 1969 season ; as part of this deal , the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game in each of the four seasons before the completed merger .

  "/wiki/All-Pro": "All-Pro is an honor bestowed upon professional American football players that designates the best player at each position during a given season . All-Pro players are typically selected by press organizations , who select an All-Pro team , a list that consists of at least 22 players , one for each offensive and defensive position , plus various special teams players depending on the press organization that compiles the list . All-Pro lists are exclusively limited to the major leagues , usually only the National Football League ; in the past , other leagues recognized as major , such as the American Football League of the 1960s or the All-America Football Conference of the 1940s , have been included in All-Pro lists . Beginning in the early 1920s , All-Pro teams have traditionally been assembled from press polls of individually voting sportswriters . After polling the writers , the votes are tallied to determine the selected players and the results have historically been published through various news syndicates . Today , the teams are mostly published online or announced on various televised sports programs . Some organizations publish two All-Pro lists , a First Team and a Second Team , with the first consisting of more prominent players than the second . The Associated Press ( AP ) and its All-Pro selections are the most widely recognized today . Other polls include the United Press International All-Pro poll , which began in the 1940s and continued in various forms until 1997 , the Newspaper Enterprise Association All-Pro team , which ran from 1954 until 1996 , and the Pro Football Writers Association All-Pro teams , which were inaugurated in 1966 and continue to be released annually . The NFL itself compiled official All-Pro lists beginning in 1931 but abandoned the practice in 1942 . The All-Pro designation , while not officially sanctioned by the NFL , is generally considered a more prestigious honor than the NFL 's official all-star designation , a Pro Bowl recognition : a minimum of twice as many Pro Bowlers are selected as first and second team All-Pro slots combined , and Pro Bowl selections often drop out , allowing a lesser player to also receive the honor by default , which does not occur with the All-Pro list .",

  "/wiki/1925_NFL_Championship_controversy": "The 1925 National Football League Championship , claimed by the Chicago Cardinals , has long been the subject of controversy . The controversy centers on the suspension of the Pottsville Maroons by NFL commissioner Joseph Carr , which prevented them from taking the title . The Maroons were one of the dominant teams of the 1925 season , and after defeating the Chicago Cardinals on December 6 , came away with the best record in the league . However , Carr suspended and removed the team from the NFL after they played an unauthorized exhibition game in Philadelphia , on the grounds that they had violated the territorial rights of the Frankford Yellow Jackets . Chicago played and won two more games against weak NFL opponents , but were sanctioned because a Chicago player , Art Folz , hired four Chicago high school football players to play for the Milwaukee Badgers under assumed names to ensure a Cardinals victory . Pottsville supporters argue that the suspension was illegitimate because the League did not then grant exclusive territory rights and that , in any event , they had verbal League approval to play the game in Philadelphia . Further , they argue that the Maroons , who were reinstated the next year , would have had the best record had they not been suspended . Others claim that Chicago was the legitimate champion based on the rules of the time . In 1963 , the NFL investigated and rejected Pottsville 's case , and in 2003 refused to reopen the case . Both the NFL and the Pro Football Hall of Fame continue to list the Cardinals as the 1925 NFL champions .",

The team played its home games at Athletic Park , later known as Borchert Field , on Milwaukee 's north side . The team was notable for having many African-American players for the time . After the team folded following the 1926 season ( largely due to being left broke because of a $ 500 fine by the NFL for using four high-school players in a 1925 game against the Chicago Cardinals , a game arranged after the Badgers had disbanded for the season ) , many of its members played for the independent semi-pro Milwaukee Eagles . Some of the players from this team went on to play for the NFL 's Pittsburgh Pirates in 1933 . This has led some to mistakenly believe that either the Badgers or Eagles became the Pittsburgh Steelers . The Milwaukee market is now claimed by the Green Bay Packers , who played three or four regular season games there from 1933-94 , including the 1939 NFL Championship Game .

The Federal League came together in early 1913 through the work of John T. Powers , and immediately challenged the operations of organized baseball . Playing in what detractors called the outlaw league allowed players to avoid the restrictions of the organized leagues ' reserve clause . The competition of another , better paying league caused players ' salaries to skyrocket , demonstrating the bargaining potential of free agency for the first time . Interference by the National and American Leagues in their operations caused the Federal League to fold after the 1915 season . This resulted in a landmark federal lawsuit , Federal Baseball Club v.

  "/wiki/National_Football_League": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

  "/wiki/Official_(American_football)": "In gridiron football , an official is a person who has responsibility in enforcing the rules and maintaining the order of the game . During professional and most college football games , seven officials operate on the field . Beginning in 2015 , Division I college football conferences are using eight game officials , and the Alliance of American Football ( AAF ) used eight game officials for its only season in 2019 . College games outside the Division I level use six or seven officials .

High school football played under the National Federation of State High School Associations ( NFHS ) rules typically use five officials for varsity and 3 , 4 , or 5 for non-varsity games . Football officials are commonly , but incorrectly , referred to collectively as referees , but each position has specific duties and a specific name : Common positions include referee , umpire , head linesman ( or down judge ) , line judge , field judge ( or back umpire ) , side judge , back judge and center judge . The CFL used an eighth official ( with no official position name ) only during the 2018 playoffs , but that official 's only responsibility was watching for head contact with the quarterback . Because the referee is responsible for the general supervision of the game , the position is sometimes referred to as head referee or crew chief .",

  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
