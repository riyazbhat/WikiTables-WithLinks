  "/wiki/HMS_King_Edward_VII": "HMS King Edward VII , named after King Edward VII , was the lead ship of her class of pre-dreadnought battleships built for the British Royal Navy . Armed with a battery of four and four guns , she and her sister ships marked a significant advance in offensive power compared to earlier British battleship designs that did not carry the 9.2 in guns . King Edward VII was built at the Devonport Dockyard , and was laid down in March 1902 , launched in July 1903 , and completed in February 1905 . The ship entered service with the Atlantic Fleet as the fleet flagship before being transferred to the Channel Fleet in 1907 , where she also served as the flagship . The Channel Fleet became the Home Fleet in 1909 , where she remained for the next several years . During this period , the fleet was repeatedly reorganized , with King Edward VII ultimately ending up in the 3rd Battle Squadron by 1912 , along with her sisters . The ships were sent to the Mediterranean during the First Balkan War to enforce the transfer of Scutari to Albania . Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 , the 3rd Battle Squadron became part of the Grand Fleet , where King Edward VII served for the next two years . The Grand Fleet conducted numerous sweeps into the North Sea in the hope of catching German vessels at sea , but rarely found action . On the morning of 6 January 1916 , while steaming to Belfast for a refit , King Edward VII struck a naval mine that had been laid by the German auxiliary cruiser . Attempts to tow King Edward VII to port failed when she took on a dangerous list , so she was abandoned and her crew evacuated to several destroyers . King Edward VII sank later that day .",
  "/wiki/HMNB_Devonport": "Her Majesty 's Naval Base , Devonport ( HMNB Devonport ) is one of three operating bases in the United Kingdom for the Royal Navy ( the others being HMNB Clyde and HMNB Portsmouth ) and is the sole nuclear repair and refuelling facility for the Royal Navy . The largest naval base in Western Europe , HMNB Devonport is located in Devonport , in the west of the city of Plymouth , England . The base began as Royal Navy Dockyard in the late 17th century , but shipbuilding ceased at Devonport in the early 1970s , although ship maintenance work has continued . The now privatised maintenance facilities are operated by Babcock Marine , a division of Babcock International Group , who took over the previous owner Devonport Management Limited ( DML ) in 2007 . DML had been running the Dockyard since privatisation in 1987 . From 1934 until the early 21st century the naval barracks on the site was named HMS Drake ( it had previously been known as HMS Vivid after the base ship of the same name ) . The name HMS Drake and its command structure has been extended to cover the entire base . The barracks buildings are now named the Fleet Accommodation Centre . In the early 1970s the newly-styled 'Fleet Maintenance Base ' was itself commissioned as HMS Defiance ; it remained so until 1994 , when it was amalgamated into HMS Drake . HM Naval Base Devonport is the home port of the Devonport Flotilla which includes the s. In 2009 the Ministry of Defence announced the conclusion of a long-running review of the long-term role of three naval bases . Devonport would no longer be used as a base for attack submarines after these moved to Faslane by 2017 , and the Type 45 destroyers are based at Portsmouth . However , Devonport retains a long-term role as the dedicated home of the amphibious fleet , survey vessels and half the frigate fleet .",

The company then withdrew from shipbuilding but its engineering arm remained successful in the manufacture of industrial gas turbines . In 1986 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Trafalgar House , which in 1996 was taken over by Kvaerner . The latter closed the Clydebank engineering works in 2000 .
