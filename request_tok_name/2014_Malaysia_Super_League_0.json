Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond .
