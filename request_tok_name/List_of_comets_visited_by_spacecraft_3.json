  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",

( This is the shortest period of a reasonably bright comet ; the faint main-belt comet 311P/PANSTARRS has a period of 3.2 years . ) Encke was first recorded by Pierre M\u00e9chain in 1786 , but it was not recognized as a periodic comet until 1819 when its orbit was computed by Johann Franz Encke ; like Halley 's Comet , it is unusual in being named after the calculator of its orbit rather than its discoverer . Like most comets , it has a very low albedo , reflecting only 4.6% of the light it receives when talking about the nucleus . However , comets generate a large coma and tail that can make them much more visible during their perihelion ( closest approach to the Sun ) . The diameter of the nucleus of Encke 's Comet is 4.8 km .",
  "/wiki/CONTOUR": "The COmet Nucleus TOUR ( CONTOUR ) was a NASA Discovery-class space probe that failed shortly after its July 2002 launch . It had as its primary objective close flybys of two comet nuclei with the possibility of a flyby of a third known comet or an as-yet-undiscovered comet . The two comets scheduled to be visited were Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 , and the third target was d'Arrest . It was hoped that a new comet would have been discovered in the inner Solar System between 2006 and 2008 , in which case the spacecraft trajectory would have been changed if possible to rendezvous with the new comet . Scientific objectives included imaging the nuclei at resolutions of up to 4 meters ( 13 ft ) , performing spectral mapping of the nuclei at resolutions of up to 100 meters ( 330 ft ) , and obtaining detailed compositional data on gas and dust in the near-nucleus environment , with the goal of improving knowledge of the characteristics of comet nuclei . After the solid rocket motor intended to inject the spacecraft into solar orbit was ignited on August 15 , 2002 , contact with the probe could not be re-established . Ground-based telescopes later found three objects along the course of the satellite , leading to the speculation that it had disintegrated . Attempts to contact the probe were ended on December 20 , 2002 . The probe thus accomplished none of its primary scientific objectives , but did prove some spaceflight technologies , such as the APL-developed non-coherent spacecraft navigation technique , which was later used on the New Horizons spacecraft .",

  "/wiki/145_Adeona": "Adeona ( minor planet designation : 145 Adeona ) is a large asteroid from the intermediate asteroid belt , approximately 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) in diameter . Its surface is very dark , and , based upon its classification as a C-type asteroid , is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous material . The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration . The Adeona family of asteroids is named after it . It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on June 3 , 1875 , from the observatory at Hamilton College , Clinton , New York . Peters named it after Adeona , the Roman goddess of homecoming , because he had recently returned from a journey across the world to observe the transit of Venus .

This near-Earth object is considered both an Apollo asteroid with the designation 4015 Wilson-Harrington and a periodic comet known as Comet Wilson-Harrington or 107P/Wilson-Harrington . It was initially discovered in 1949 as a comet and then lost to further observations . Thirty years later it was rediscovered as an asteroid , after which it took over a decade to determine that these observations were of the same object . Therefore , it has both a comet designation and an asteroid designation , and with a name length of 17 characters it is currently the asteroid with the longest name , having one more character than the 16-character limit imposed by the IAU . The comet was discovered on November 19 , 1949 , by Albert G. Wilson and Robert G. Harrington at Palomar Observatory . Only three photographic observations were obtained and the comet was lost ( insufficient observations to determine a precise enough orbit to know where to look for future appearances of the comet , see Lost comet ) .

It was discovered by Eleanor F. Helin on February 28 , 1982 , approximately 1 month after a near pass by the Earth . Nereus is potentially a very important asteroid . It is an Apollo and Mars-crosser , with an orbit that frequently comes very close to Earth , and because of this it is exceptionally accessible to spacecraft . Indeed , because of its small size and close orbit , its delta-V for rendezvous of ~5 km/s is smaller than the Moon 's , which is about 6.3 km/s . Nereus makes seven approaches to Earth of less than 5 million km between 1900 and 2100 . The closest will be in February 2060 , at 1.2 million km . The next close approach is in December 2021 , when it will be 3.9 million km away . Its orbital period of 1.82 yr also puts it somewhat near a 2:1 orbital resonance with Earth , which means that an approximately 4-year mission could depart for and return from the asteroid on relatively near passes to the Earth . Nereus is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid ( PHA ) , due to both its absolute magnitude ( H \u2264 22 ) and its minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID \u2264 0.05 AU ) .
