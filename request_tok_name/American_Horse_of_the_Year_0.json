At age 18 , he moved to the United States where he attended college and ultimately obtained a master 's degree in business and public health from Boston University . After a brief career in commercial real estate in New York City , he returned to Egypt , and for about a decade ran the Al-Ahram Beverages Company , which he owned as part of an investment group .

He also filed bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses . Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization , but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing . Nonetheless , Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems , a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award .",
