  "/wiki/Latin_script": "Latin or Roman script is a set of graphic signs ( script ) based on the letters of the classical Latin alphabet . This is derived from a form of the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet used by the Etruscans . Several Latin-script alphabets exist , which differ in graphemes , collation and phonetic values from the classical Latin alphabet . The Latin script is the basis of the International Phonetic Alphabet and the 26 most widespread letters are the letters contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet . Latin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any writing system and is the most widely adopted writing system in the world ( commonly used by about 70 percent of the world 's population ) . Latin script is used as the standard method of writing in most Western , Central , as well as in some Eastern European languages , as well as in many languages in other parts of the world .",
  "/wiki/Alphabet": "An alphabet is a standard set of letters ( basic written symbols or graphemes ) that represent the phonemes ( basic significant sounds ) of any spoken language used for its written form . This is in contrast to other types of writing systems , such as syllabaries ( in which each character represents a syllable ) and logographic systems ( in which each character represents a word , morpheme , or semantic unit ) . The first fully phonemic script , the Proto-Canaanite script , later known as the Phoenician alphabet , is considered to be the first alphabet , and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets , including Arabic , Greek , Latin , Cyrillic , Hebrew , and possibly Brahmic . Peter T. Daniels , however , distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary , a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels ( as in Devanagari and other South Asian scripts ) , an abjad , in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants ( as in the original Phoenician , Hebrew or Arabic ) , and an alphabet , a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants . In this narrow sense of the word the first true alphabet was the Greek alphabet , which was developed on the basis of the earlier Phoenician alphabet . Of the dozens of alphabets in use today , the most popular is the Latin alphabet , which was derived from the Greek , and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks . While most alphabets have letters composed of lines ( linear writing ) , there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille . The Khmer alphabet ( for Cambodian ) is the longest , with 74 letters . Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters . This makes them useful for purposes of collation , specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order . It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of numbering ordered items , in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements .",

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet . Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome , known as Latium . Through the power of the Roman Republic , it became the dominant language in Italy , and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire . Latin has contributed many words to the English language . In particular , Latin ( and Ancient Greek ) roots are used in English descriptions of theology , the sciences , medicine , and law . By the late Roman Republic ( 75 BC ) , Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin . Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence and author Petronius . Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century and the colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages , such as French , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian , Catalan and Spanish in the 6th to 9th centuries . Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin . Later , Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved . Latin was used as the language of international communication , scholarship and science until well into the 18th century , when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars ( including the Romance languages ) .",
  "/wiki/Romance_languages": "The Romance languages ( nowadays rarely Latin languages , or Neo-Latin languages ) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the third and eighth centuries . They are a subgroup of the Italic languages in the Indo-European language family . Today , around 800 million people are native speakers worldwide , mainly in the Americas , Europe , and parts of Africa , as well as elsewhere . Additionally , the major Romance languages have many non-native speakers and are in widespread use as lingua francas . This is especially the case for French , which is in widespread use throughout Central and West Africa , Madagascar , Mauritius , and North Africa ( excluding Egypt ) . The five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are Spanish ( 480 million ) , Portuguese ( 221 million ) , French ( 77 million ) , Italian ( 65 million ) , and Romanian ( 24 million ) . Because of the difficulty of imposing boundaries on a continuum , various counts of the modern Romance languages are given ; for example , Dalby lists 23 based on mutual intelligibility .

It has an official minority status in western Istria ( Croatia and Slovenia ) . It formerly had official status in Albania , Malta , Monaco , Montenegro ( Kotor ) and Greece ( Ionian Islands and Dodecanese ) , and is generally understood in Corsica ( due to its close relation with the Tuscan-influenced local language ) and Savoie . It also used to be an official language in the former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa , where it still plays a significant role in various sectors . Italian is also spoken by large expatriate communities in the Americas and Australia . Italian is included under the languages covered by the European Charter for Regional or Minority languages in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Romania , although Italian is neither a co-official nor a protected language in these countries . Many speakers of Italian are native bilinguals of both Italian ( either in its standard form or regional varieties ) and other regional languages . Italian is a major European language , being one of the official languages of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and one of the working languages of the Council of Europe . It is the fourth most widely spoken first language in the European Union with 69 million native speakers ( 13% of the EU population ) and it is spoken as a second language by 16 million EU citizens ( 3% ) .

Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French .

Franco-Proven\u00e7al has several distinct dialects and is separate from but closely related to neighboring Romance dialects ( the langues d'o\u00efl and Occitan , Rhaeto-Romance , Lombard , Piedmontese ) . The designation Franco-Proven\u00e7al ( Franco-Proven\u00e7al : francoproven\u00e7\u00e2l ; French : francoproven\u00e7al ; Italian : francoprovenzale ) dates to the 19th century . Traditionally , the dialect group is also referred to as patois ( patou\u00e8s ) , and since the late 20th century as Arpitan ( Franco-Proven\u00e7al : arpetan ; Italian : arpitano ) , and its areal as Arpitania . The number of speakers of Franco-Proven\u00e7al has been declining significantly . According to UNESCO ( 1995 ) , Franco-Proven\u00e7al is a potentially endangered language in Italy and an endangered language in Switzerland and France . Formerly spoken throughout the territory of Savoy , Franco-Proven\u00e7al speakers are now found in the Aosta Valley , an autonomous administrative division of Italy . The language is also spoken in alpine valleys in the Metropolitan City of Turin , two isolated towns ( Faeto and Celle di San Vito ) in the Province of Foggia , and rural areas of the Swiss Romandie . It is one of the three Gallo-Romance language families of France and is officially recognized as a regional language of France , but its use is marginal .

It is spoken in Southern France , Italy 's Occitan Valleys , Monaco , as well as Spain 's Val d'Aran ; collectively , these regions are sometimes referred to as Occitania . Occitan is also spoken in the linguistic enclave of Guardia Piemontese ( Calabria , Italy ) . Some include Catalan in Occitan , as the distance between this language and some Occitan dialects ( such as the Gascon language ) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects . In fact , Catalan was considered an Occitan dialect until the end of the 19th century . Today , Occitan is an official language in Catalonia , where a subdialect of Gascon known as Aranese is spoken in the Val d'Aran . Occitan 's closest relative is Catalan . Since September 2010 , the Parliament of Catalonia has considered Aranese Occitan to be the officially preferred language for use in the Val d'Aran .

Unlike other Romance languages such as French or Spanish , there is no single written standard language called Occitan , and Occitan has no official status in France , home to most of Occitania . Instead , there are competing norms for writing Occitan , some of which attempt to be pan-dialectal , whereas others are based on particular dialects . These efforts are hindered by the rapidly declining use of Occitan as a spoken language in much of southern France , as well as by the significant differences in phonology and vocabulary among different Occitan dialects .",

Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages .

The Rhaeto-Romance languages form a group of Romance languages in the Alps region of northern Italy and Switzerland . Initially studied by Italian Linguist Graziadio Ascoli in 1873 , Ascoli found these languages to share a number of intricacies and believed they belonged to a specific linguistic group . What distinguishes Rhaeto-Romance languages from Italian and other Western languages are its phonemic vowel length ( long stressed vowels ) , consonant formation , and a central rounded vowel series . A few notable examples of these languages are Romansh , Friulian and Ladin , which are officially recognized alongside German , French and Italian , by the Swiss and Italian governments respectively .

German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level ( but third after English and French at lower secondary level ) , the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US ( after Spanish , French and American Sign Language ) , and the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after English and Russian . The German-speaking countries are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books , with one tenth of all books ( including e-books ) in the world being published in the German language . In the United Kingdom , German and French are the most sought-after foreign languages for businesses ( with 49% and 50% of businesses identifying these two languages as the most useful , respectively ) . German is an inflected language with four cases for nouns , pronouns and adjectives ( nominative , accusative , genitive , dative ) , three genders ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) , two numbers ( singular , plural ) , and strong and weak verbs .",
  "/wiki/North_Germanic_languages": "The North Germanic languages make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages , a sub-family of the Indo-European languages , along with the West Germanic languages and the extinct East Germanic languages . The language group is also referred to as the Nordic languages , a direct translation of the most common term used among Danish , Faroese , Icelandic , Norwegian , and Swedish scholars and laypeople . In Scandinavia , the term Scandinavian languages refers specifically to the mutually intelligible modern languages of the three continental Scandinavian countries and is thus used in a more narrow sense as a subset of the Nordic languages , leaving aside the insular subset of Faroese and Icelandic . Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish are also referred to as Continental Nordic languages , while Faroese and Icelandic are grouped together as Insular Nordic languages . In scholarly literature in English , the term Scandinavian is also sometimes used synonymously with Nordic ( North Germanic ) languages when discussing the languages in a genetic perspective . The term Scandinavian arose in the 18th century as a result of the early linguistic and cultural Scandinavist movement , referring to the people , cultures , and languages of the three Scandinavian countries and stressing their common heritage . The term North Germanic languages is used in comparative linguistics , whereas the term Scandinavian languages appears in studies of the modern standard languages and the dialect continuum of Scandinavia . Approximately 20 million people in the Nordic countries speak a Scandinavian language as their native language , including an approximately 5% minority in Finland . Languages belonging to the North Germanic language tree are also commonly spoken on Greenland and , to a lesser extent , by immigrants in North America .",

Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China . About 1.2 billion people ( around 16% of the world 's population ) speak some form of Chinese as their first language . The varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech , without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible . Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility , linguists generally describe them as distinct languages , perhaps hundreds , sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages . [ b ] Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started . Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g . Southwestern Mandarin ) , followed by Min ( 75 million , e.g . Southern Min ) , Wu ( 74 million , e.g . Shanghainese ) , Yue ( 68 million , e.g . Cantonese ) .

It is often used to teach Standard Mandarin Chinese , which is normally written using Chinese characters . The system includes four diacritics denoting tones . Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters . The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by many linguists , including Zhou Youguang , based on earlier forms of romanizations of Chinese . It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times . The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982 , and was followed by the United Nations in 1986 . The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009 , where it is used for international events rather than for educational or computer-input purposes . But some cities , businesses , and organizations , notably in the south of Taiwan , did not accept this , as it suggested that Taiwan is more closely tied to the PRC , so it remains one of several rival romanization systems in use . The word H\u00e0ny\u01d4 ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u8bed ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u8a9e ) means 'the spoken language of the Han people ' , while P\u012bny\u012bn ( \u62fc\u97f3 ) literally means 'spelled sounds ' .",

According to some estimates , the family contains 1,257 languages , which is the second most of any language family . In 1706 , the Dutch scholar Adriaan Reland first observed similarities between the languages spoken in the Malay Archipelago and by peoples on islands in the Pacific Ocean . In the 19th century , researchers ( e.g . Wilhelm von Humboldt , Herman van der Tuuk ) started to apply the comparative method to the Austronesian languages . The first extensive study on the history of the sound system was made by the German linguist Otto Dempwolff . It included a reconstruction of the Proto-Austronesian lexicon .

However , in areas of central to southern Sumatra where vernacular varieties of Malay are indigenous , Indonesians refer to it as Bahasa Melayu and consider it one of their regional languages . Standard Malay , also called Court Malay , was the literary standard of the pre-colonial Malacca and Johor Sultanates , and so the language is sometimes called Malacca , Johor or Riau Malay ( or various combinations of those names ) to distinguish it from the various other Malayan languages .

There are approximately forty Polynesian languages . The most prominent of these are Tahitian , Samoan , Tongan , M\u0101ori and Hawaiian . As humans first settled the Polynesian islands relatively recently and because internal linguistic diversification only began around 2,000 years ago , the Polynesian languages retain strong commonalities . There are still many cognate words across the different islands , for example : tapu , ariki , motu , kava , and tapa as well as Hawaiki , the mythical homeland for some of the cultures . All Polynesian languages show strong similarity , particularly in vocabulary . The vowels are often stable in the descendant languages , nearly always a , e , i , o and u.

The Slavic languages are conventionally ( that is , also on the basis of extralinguistic features ) divided intro three subgroups : East , West , and South , which together constitute more than 20 languages . Of these , 10 have at least one million speakers and official status as the national languages of the countries in which they are predominantly spoken : Russian , Belarusian and Ukrainian ( of the East group ) , Polish , Czech and Slovak ( of the West group ) and Bulgarian and Macedonian ( eastern dialects of the South group ) , and Serbo-Croatian and Slovene ( western dialects of the South group ) . The current geographic distribution of natively spoken Slavic languages covers Eastern Europe , the Balkans , Central Europe and all of the territory of Russia , which includes northern and north-central Asia . Furthermore , the diasporas of many Slavic peoples have established isolated minorities of speakers of their languages all over the world .

With about 7.5 million speakers , it comprises an independent branch within the Indo-European languages and is not closely related to any other language . First attested in the 15th century , it is the last Indo-European branch to appear in written records . This is one of the reasons why its still-unknown origin has long been a matter of dispute among linguists and historians . Albanian is considered to be the descendant of one of the Paleo-Balkan languages of antiquity . For more historical and geographical reasons than specifically linguistic ones , there are various modern historians and linguists who believe that the Albanian language may have descended from a southern Illyrian dialect spoken in much the same region in classical times . Alternative hypotheses hold that Albanian may have descended from Thracian or Daco-Moesian , other ancient languages spoken farther east than Illyrian . Not enough is known of these languages to completely prove or disprove the various hypotheses . The two main Albanian dialects , Gheg and Tosk which are primarily distinguished by phonological differences , are mutually intelligible , with Gheg spoken in the north and Tosk spoken in the south of the Shkumbin river . Their characteristics in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages , have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region ( 4th century AD ) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans , with the historic boundary between Gheg and Tosk being the Shkumbin which straddled the Jire\u010dek line .

  "/wiki/Maltese_language": "Maltese ( Maltese : Malti ) is a Semitic language spoken by the Maltese people of Malta . It is a standardised and Latinised variety of Arabic . It is the national language of the country and also serves as an official language of the European Union , the only Semitic language so distinguished . Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic , which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect during the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091 . As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-christianisation of the island , Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of Latinisation . It is therefore exceptional as a variety of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic . Maltese morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages , namely Italian and Sicilian . The original Arabic base comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary , especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words , but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian ; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary . However , rural dialects of Maltese show more similarities to the original Siculo-Arabic ancestor as compared to Standard Maltese . A 2016 study shows that , in terms of basic everyday language , speakers of Maltese are able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic , which is a Maghrebi Arabic dialect with a significant Latin substratum , whereas speakers of Tunisian Arabic are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese . This reported level of asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between other varieties of Arabic . Maltese has always been written in the Latin script , the earliest surviving example dating from the late Middle Ages .",

There are around 7 million speakers who live mainly in Finland and Estonia . Traditionally , eight Finnic languages have been recognized . The major modern representatives of the family are Finnish and Estonian , the official languages of their respective nation states . The other Finnic languages in the Baltic Sea region are Ingrian and Votic , spoken in Ingria by the Gulf of Finland ; and Livonian , once spoken around the Gulf of Riga . Spoken farther northeast are Karelian , Ludic and Veps , in the region of Lakes Onega and Ladoga . In addition , since the 1990s , several Finnic-speaking minority groups have emerged to seek recognition for their languages as distinct from the ones they have been considered dialects of in the past . Some of there groups have established their own orthographies and standardised languages . V\u00f5ro and Seto , which are spoken in southeastern Estonia and in some parts of Russia , have been considered dialects of Estonian in the past but modern day linguistics consider them their own languages . Me\u00e4nkieli and Kven are spoken in northern Sweden and Norway respectively and have the legal status of independent minority languages . They were earlier considered dialects of Finnish and are somewhat mutually intelligible with it , depending on the dialect .

They have been adapted to write a number of other Asian languages . They remain a key component of the Japanese writing system where they are known as kanji . Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world . By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia , and historic use throughout the Sinosphere , Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users . Chinese characters number in the tens of thousands , though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts . Unlike an alphabet , a character-based writing system associates each logogram with an entire sound and thus may be compared in some aspects to a syllabary . Functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters . In Japan , 2,136 are taught through secondary school ( the J\u014dy\u014d kanji ) ; hundreds more are in everyday use . Due to post-WWII simplifications of characters in Japan as well as in China , the Chinese characters used in Japan today are distinct from those used in China in several respects . There are various national standard lists of characters , forms , and pronunciations . Simplified forms of certain characters are used in mainland China , Singapore , and Malaysia ; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau , and to a limited extent in South Korea .",
  "/wiki/Logographic": "In a written language , a logogram or logograph is a written character that represents a word or phrase . Chinese characters ( including Chinese hanzi , Japanese kanji and Korean hanja ) are logograms ; some Egyptian hieroglyphs and some graphemes in cuneiform script are also logograms . The use of logograms in writing is called logography , and a writing system that is based on logograms is called a logographic system . In the alphabets and syllabaries , individual written characters represent sounds only , rather than entire concepts . These characters are called phonograms in linguistics . Unlike logograms , phonograms do not have word or phrase meanings singularly until the phonograms are combined with additional phonograms thus creating words and phrases that have meaning .

The group includes the Beijing dialect , the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin . Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north , the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects ( \u5317\u65b9\u8bdd ; b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0 ) . Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible . Nevertheless , Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers ( with nearly a billion ) . Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups , spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area , stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast . This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south , combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas . Most Mandarin varieties have four tones . The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties , but some have merged them as a final glottal stop . Many Mandarin varieties , including the Beijing dialect , retain retroflex initial consonants , which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese . The capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium , making these dialects very influential . Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century .",
  "/wiki/Cantonese": "Cantonese is a variety of Chinese originating from the city of Guangzhou ( also known as Canton ) and its surrounding area in Southeastern China . It is the traditional prestige variety of the Yue Chinese dialect group , which has about 68 million native speakers . While the term Cantonese specifically refers to the prestige variety , it is often used to refer to the entire Yue subgroup of Chinese , including related but largely mutually unintelligible languages and dialects such as Taishanese . Cantonese is viewed as a vital and inseparable part of the cultural identity for its native speakers across large swaths of Southeastern China , Hong Kong , and Macau , as well as in overseas communities . In mainland China , it is the lingua franca of the province of Guangdong ( being the majority language of the Pearl River Delta ) and neighbouring areas such as Guangxi . It is the dominant and regional language of Hong Kong and Macau . Cantonese is also widely spoken amongst Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia ( most notably in Vietnam and Malaysia , as well as in Singapore and Cambodia to a lesser extent ) and throughout the Western world . Although Cantonese shares much vocabulary with Mandarin , the two varieties are mutually unintelligible because of differences in pronunciation , grammar , and lexicon . Sentence structure , in particular the placement of verbs , sometimes differs between the two varieties . A notable difference between Cantonese and Mandarin is how the spoken word is written ; both can be recorded verbatim , but very few Cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full Cantonese written vocabulary , so a non-verbatim formalized written form is adopted , which is more akin to the Mandarin written form . This results in the situation in which a Cantonese and a Mandarin text may look similar but are pronounced differently .",

Major Wu varieties include those of Shanghai , Suzhou , Wuxi , Changzhou , Ningbo , Hangzhou , Shaoxing , Wenzhou , Jinhua and Yongkang . Wu speakers , such as Chiang Kai-shek , Lu Xun and Cai Yuanpei , occupied positions of great importance in modern Chinese culture and politics . Wu can also be found being used in Pingtan , Yue opera , and Shanghai opera , the former which is second only in national popularity to Peking opera ; as well as in the performances of the popular entertainer and comedian Zhou Libo . Wu is also spoken in a large number of diaspora communities , with significant centers of immigration originating from Shanghai , Ningbo , Qingtian and Wenzhou . Suzhou has traditionally been the linguistic center of Wu and was likely the first place the distinct variety of Sinitic known as Wu developed . Suzhou dialect is widely considered to be the most linguistically representative of the family . It was mostly the basis of the Wu lingua franca that developed in Shanghai leading to the formation of standard Shanghainese , which as a center of economic power and possessing the largest population of Wu speakers , has attracted the most attention . Due to the influence of Shanghainese , Wu as a whole is incorrectly labelled in English as simply , Shanghainese , when introducing the language family to non-specialists . Wu is the more accurate terminology for the greater grouping that the Shanghainese variety is part of ; other less precise terms include Jiangnan speech ( \u6c5f\u5357\u8a71 ) , Jiangzhe ( Jiangsu-Zhejiang ) speech ( \u6c5f\u6d59\u8a71 ) , and less commonly Wuyue speech ( \u5433\u8d8a\u8a9e ) . The Wu group ( Southern Wu in particular ) is well known among linguists and sinologists as being one of the most internally diverse among the Sinitic groups , with very little mutual intelligibility between varieties across subgroups . Among speakers of other Sinitic languages , Wu is often subjectively judged to be soft , light , and flowing .",

It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent .

Okinawans are assimilating and accenting standard Japanese due to the similarity of the two languages , standardized and centralized education system , the media , business and social contact with mainlanders and previous attempts from Japan to suppress the native languages . Okinawan is still kept alive in popular music , tourist shows and in theaters featuring a local drama called Uchin\u0101 shibai , which depict local customs and manners .",

As a dialect , modern Okinawan is not written frequently . When it is , the Japanese writing system is generally used in an ad hoc manner . There is no standard orthography for the modern language . Nonetheless , there are a few systems used by scholars and laypeople alike .

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

Most Chinese Indonesians are descended from Southern Chinese immigrants . Chinese people have lived in the Indonesian archipelago since at least the 13th century . Many came initially as sojourners ( temporary residents ) , intending to return home in their old age . Some , however , stayed in the region as economic migrants . Their population grew rapidly during the colonial period when workers were contracted from their home provinces in southern China . Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians has occurred since the start of Dutch colonialism in the region , although government policies implemented since 1998 have attempted to redress this . Resentment of ethnic Chinese economic aptitude grew in the 1950s as Native Indonesian merchants felt they could not remain competitive . In some cases , government action propagated the stereotype that ethnic Chinese-owned conglomerates were corrupt . Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis severely disrupted their business activities , reform of government policy and legislation removed a number of political and social restrictions on Chinese Indonesians . The development of local Chinese society and culture is based upon three pillars : clan associations , ethnic media and Chinese language schools . These flourished during the period of Chinese nationalism in the final years of China 's Qing dynasty and through the Second Sino-Japanese War ; however , differences in the objective of nationalist sentiments brought about a split in the population .",

It was developed in ancient India from the 1st to the 4th century CE and was in regular use by the 7th century CE . The Devanagari script , composed of 47 primary characters including 14 vowels and 33 consonants , is one of the most adopted writing systems in the world , being used for over 120 languages . The ancient Nagari script for Sanskrit had two additional consonantal characters . The orthography of this script reflects the pronunciation of the language . Unlike the Latin alphabet , the script has no concept of letter case . It is written from left to right , has a strong preference for symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines and is recognisable by a horizontal line that runs along the top of full letters . In a cursory look , the Devanagari script appears different from other Indic scripts such as Bengali , Odia or Gurmukhi , but a closer examination reveals they are very similar except for angles and structural emphasis . Among the languages using it - as either their only script or one of their scripts - are P\u0101\u1e37i , Sanskrit , Hindi , Nepali , Sherpa , Prakrit , Apabhramsha , Awadhi , Bhojpuri , Braj Bhasha , Chhattisgarhi , Haryanvi , Magahi , Nagpuri , Rajasthani , Bhili , Dogri , Marathi , Maithili , Kashmiri , Konkani , Sindhi , Bodo , Nepalbhasa , Mundari and Santali .

This contrasts with a full alphabet , in which vowels have status equal to consonants , and with an abjad , in which vowel marking is absent , partial , or optional ( although in less formal contexts , all three types of script may be termed alphabets ) . The terms also contrast them with a syllabary , in which the symbols can not be split into separate consonants and vowels . Abugidas include the extensive Brahmic family of scripts of Tibet , South and Southeast Asia , Semitic Ethiopic scripts , and Canadian Aboriginal syllabics ( which are themselves based in part on Brahmic scripts ) . As is the case for syllabaries , the units of the writing system may consist of the representations both of syllables and of consonants . For scripts of the Brahmic family , the term akshara is used for the units . \u00c4bugida is an Ethiopian name for the Geez script , taken from four letters of that script , ' \u00e4 bu gi da , in much the same way that abecedary is derived from Latin a be ce de , abjad is derived from the Arabic a b j d , and alphabet is derived from the names of the two first letters in the Greek alphabet , alpha and beta . Abugida as a term in linguistics was proposed by Peter T. Daniels in his 1990 typology of writing systems . As Daniels used the word , an abugida is in contrast with a syllabary , where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to one another , and also with an alphabet proper , where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels . The term alphasyllabary was suggested for the Indic scripts in 1997 by William Bright , following South Asian linguistic usage , to convey the idea that they share features of both alphabet and syllabary . Abugidas were long considered to be syllabaries , or intermediate between syllabaries and alphabets , and the term syllabics is retained in the name of Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics . Other terms that have been used include neosyllabary ( F\u00e9vrier 1959 ) , pseudo-alphabet ( Householder 1959 ) , semisyllabary ( Diringer 1968 ; a word that has other uses ) and syllabic alphabet ( Coulmas 1996 ; this term is also a synonym for syllabary ) .",

As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",

In India , it is one of 22 constitutionally recognised official languages , having official status in the five states of Telangana , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , as well as the national capital territory of Delhi . As both registers are composed of the same Indo-Aryan vocabulary base , colloquial Urdu is largely mutually intelligible with colloquial Hindi , with the two registers being grouped together as Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu . With respect to literary vocabulary , however , formal Urdu draws heavily from Persian vocabulary and requires knowledge of some simple Persian grammatical structures , while formal Hindi heavily draws from Sanskrit for its formal and technical vocabulary . Later , Urdu became the official language of government in northern and northwest British India , along with English , from 1837 onwards in place of Persian , which had been used by various Indo-Islamic empires as their language of government . Religious , social , and political factors arose during the colonial period that advocated for a distinction between Urdu and Hindi , leading to the Hindi-Urdu controversy . According to Nationalencyklopedin 's 2010 estimates , Urdu is the 21st most spoken first language in the world , with approximately 66 million who speak it as their native language . According to Ethnologue 's 2018 estimates , Urdu , is the 11th most widely spoken language in the world , with 170 million total speakers , including those who speak it as a second language .

  "/wiki/Cyrillic": "The Cyrillic script ( /s\u026a\u02c8r\u026al\u026ak/ ) is a writing system used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic- , Turkic- and Persian-speaking countries in Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , Central Asia , and Northern Asia . In the 9th century AD the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great , following the cultural and political course of his father Boris I , commissioned a new script , the Early Cyrillic alphabet , to be made at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire , which would replace the Glagolitic script , produced earlier by Saints Cyril and Methodius and the same disciples that created the new Slavic script in Bulgaria . The usage of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria was made official in 893 . The new script became the basis of alphabets used in various languages , especially those of Orthodox Slavic origin , and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian . As of 2019 [ update ] , around 250 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages , with Russia accounting for about half of them . With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007 , Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union , following Latin and Greek . Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script , augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet , including some ligatures . These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek . The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers , Saints Cyril and Methodius , who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on . Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by the early disciples of Cyril and Methodius , particularly by Clement of Ohrid . In the early 18th century , the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great , who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe . The new letterforms became closer to those of the Latin alphabet ; several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great .",

Standard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian , Shtokavian ( more specifically on the dialects of \u0160umadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina ) , which is also the basis of standard Croatian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin varieties and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats , Bosniaks , Serbs and Montenegrins was issued in 2017 . The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia , which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian . Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic , using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets . The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 , who created it based on phonemic principles . The Serbian Latin alphabet was designed by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1830 .",

It is the official state language of Ukraine and one of the three official languages in the unrecognized state of Transnistria , the other two being Moldovan and Russian . Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the Cyrillic script ( see Ukrainian alphabet ) . Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the Old East Slavic of the early medieval state of Kievan Rus ' . After the fall of the Kievan Rus ' as well as the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia , the language developed into a form called the Ruthenian language . The Ukrainian language has been in common use since the late 17th century , associated with the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate . From 1804 until the Russian Revolution , the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the Russian Empire , of which the biggest part of Ukraine ( Central , Eastern and Southern ) was a part at the time . It has always maintained a sufficient base in Western Ukraine , where the language was never banned , in its folk songs , itinerant musicians , and prominent authors . The standard Ukrainian language is regulated by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ( NANU ) , particularly by its Institute for the Ukrainian Language , Ukrainian language-information fund , and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies .

A related United Nations paper adds that every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct . One definition describes Eastern Europe as a cultural entity : the region lying in Europe with the main characteristics consisting of Greek , Byzantine , Eastern Orthodox , Russian , and some Ottoman cultural influences . Another definition was created during the Cold War and used more or less synonymously with the term Eastern Bloc .

In pre-Islamic and early Islamic times , Central Asia was predominantly Iranian , populated by Eastern Iranian-speaking Bactrians , Sogdians , Chorasmians and the semi-nomadic Scythians and Dahae . After expansion by Turkic peoples , Central Asia also became the homeland for the Kazakhs , Uzbeks , Tatars , Turkmen , Kyrgyz , and Uyghurs ; Turkic languages largely replaced the Iranian languages spoken in the area . Central Asia has historically been closely tied to its nomadic peoples and the Silk Road . It has acted as a crossroads for the movement of people , goods , and ideas between Europe , Western Asia , South Asia , and East Asia . The Silk Road connected Muslim lands with the people of Europe , India , and China . This crossroads position has intensified the conflict between tribalism and traditionalism and modernization . From the mid-19th century until almost the end of the 20th century , most of Central Asia was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union , both Slavic-majority countries , and the five former Soviet -stans are still home to about 7 million ethnic Russians and 500,000 Ukrainians .

  "/wiki/Kana": "Kana ( \u4eee\u540d , Japanese pronunciation : [ kana ] ) are the syllabaries that form parts of the Japanese writing system , contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji ( \u6f22\u5b57 ) . The modern Japanese writing system makes use of two syllabaries : cursive hiragana ( \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a ) and angular katakana ( \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca ) . Also classified as kana is the ancient syllabic use of kanji known as man'y\u014dgana ( \u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d ) , which was ancestral to both hiragana and katakana . Hentaigana ( \u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d , variant kana ) are historical variants of modern standard hiragana . In modern Japanese , hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding sets of characters representing the same series of sounds . Katakana , with a few additions , are also used to write Ainu . Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as glosses ( furigana ) for Chinese characters in Taiwan under Japanese rule . Each kana character ( syllabogram ) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language . Apart from the five vowels , this is always CV ( consonant onset with vowel nucleus ) , such as ka , ki , etc. , or V ( vowel ) , such as a , i , etc. , with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure has led some scholars to label the system moraic instead of syllabic , because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda ( i.e . CVn , CVm , CVng ) , a CVV syllable with complex nucleus ( i.e . multiple or expressively long vowels ) , or a CCV syllable with complex onset ( i.e . including a glide , CyV , CwV ) .",

It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau , Indonesia . A Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode ( 1987 ) developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien , and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin ( see Taiwanese Hangul ) . The Hangul alphabet originally consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters when it was created . As four became obsolete , modern Hangul consists of a total of 24 letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters . In North Korea the total is counted 40 .

He asserts that alphabets have no symbols for anything smaller than a phoneme . :5 A featural script represents finer detail than an alphabet . Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes , but rather the elements ( features ) that make up the phonemes , such as voicing or its place of articulation . Theoretically , each feature could be written with a separate letter ; and abjads or abugidas , or indeed syllabaries , could be featural , but the only prominent system of this sort is the Korean alphabet , also known as hangul . In the Korean alphabet , the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters , and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks , so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation . Many scholars , e.g . John DeFrancis , reject this class or at least labeling the Korean alphabet as such . [ citation needed ] The Korean script is called by Daniels a sophisticated grammatogeny .

To the north and northwest , the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok ( known as the Yalu in Chinese ) and Tumen rivers , and to the south , it is bordered by South Korea , with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two . Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed . North Korea officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state , and formally holds elections , though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections . Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship , particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . The Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , led by a member of the ruling family , holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members . Juche , an ideology of national self-reliance , was introduced into the constitution in 1972 .",

Kannada is attested epigraphically for about one and a half millennia , and literary Old Kannada flourished in the 6th-century Ganga dynasty and during the 9th-century Rashtrakuta Dynasty . Kannada has an unbroken literary history of over a thousand years . Kannada literature has been presented with 8 Jnanapith awards , the most for any Dravidian language and the second highest for any Indian language . Based on the recommendations of the Committee of Linguistic Experts , appointed by the ministry of culture , the government of India designated Kannada a classical language of India .

The 2001 census had reported a total of 1,722,768 native speakers , According to one estimate reported in 2009 , Tulu is currently spoken by 3 to 5 million speakers in the world . There is some difficulty in counting Tulu speakers who have migrated from their native region as they often get counted as Kannada speakers in Indian Census reports Separated early from Proto-South Dravidian , Tulu has several features not found in Tamil-Kannada . For example , it has the pluperfect and the future perfect , like French or Spanish , but formed without an auxiliary verb . Robert Caldwell , in his pioneering work A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages , called this language peculiar and very interesting . According to him , Tulu is one of the most highly developed languages of the Dravidian family . It looks as if it had been cultivated for its own sake .

The term Kodava has two related usages . Firstly , it is the name of the Kodava language and culture followed by a number of communities from Kodagu . Secondly , within the Kodava-speaking communities and region ( Kodagu ) , it is a demonym for the dominant Kodava people . Hence , the Kodava language is not only the primary language of the Kodavas but also of many other castes and tribes in Kodagu . The language has two dialects : Mendele ( spoken in Northern and Central Kodagu , i.e . outside Kodagu 's Kiggat naadu ) and Kiggat ( spoken in Kiggat naadu , in Southern Kodagu ) . Historically , it has been referred to as a dialect of Kannada . However it has been re-analysed as a language by early 20th century academics . It is traditionally written using the Kannada script which is an abugida , with less frequent usage of the Malayalam script . However , an abugida called the Coorgi-Cox alphabet has been developed on the request of community members .

It is sometimes considered a dialect of Kannada or Tamil , but there are considerable differences that make it unintelligible to speakers of both languages . It has strong lexical influences from Kannada ( particularly in the colloquial language ) , as well as Sanskrit , Tamil and Tulu . It is most commonly spoken in Karnataka , India by the Sankethi people , who migrated from Sengottai in Tamilnadu . The language is most often written in the Kannada script , though it could be written in Tamil as well . However , Sankethi ( especially in the spoken form ) has relatively higher frequencies of consonant clusters of more than two consonants and semivowels .

It is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism and the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism . Sanskrit , in its variants and numerous dialects , was the lingua franca of ancient and medieval India . In the early 1st millennium CE , along with Buddhism and Hinduism , Sanskrit migrated to Southeast Asia , parts of East Asia and Central Asia , emerging as a language of high culture and of local ruling elites in these regions . Sanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language . As one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European family of languages , [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies . It is related to Greek and Latin , as well as Hittite , Luwian , Old Avestan and many other living and extinct languages with historical significance to Europe , West Asia , Central Asia and South Asia . It traces its linguistic ancestry to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language , Proto-Indo-Iranian and the Proto-Indo-European languages . Sanskrit is traceable to the 2nd millennium BCE in a form known as Vedic Sanskrit , with the Rigveda as the earliest-known composition . A more refined and standardized grammatical form called Classical Sanskrit emerged in the mid-1st millennium BCE with the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b treatise of P\u0101\u1e47ini .

Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf , the language is also widely spoken in Gulf countries . The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars . One view holds that Malayalam and modern Tamil are offshoots of Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c. 7th century AD . A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of Proto-Dravidian or Proto-Tamil-Malayalam in the prehistoric era . Designated a Classical Language in India in 2013 , it developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century . The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 AD and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 AD .

It is the native language of the Isan people , spoken by 20 million or so people in Thailand , a third of the population of Thailand and 80 percent of all Lao speakers . The language remains the primary language in 88 percent of households in Isan . It is commonly used as a second , third , or fourth language by the region 's other linguistic minorities , such as Northern Khmer , Khorat Thai , Kuy , Nyah Kur , and other Tai or Austronesian-speaking peoples . The Isan language has unofficial status in Thailand and can be differentiated as a whole from the Lao language of Laos by the increasing use of Thai grammar , vocabulary , and neologisms . Code-switching is common , depending on the context or situation . Adoption of Thai neologisms has also further differentiated Isan from standard Lao .",
  "/wiki/Kelantan-Pattani_Malay": "Kelantan-Pattani Malay , often referred to in Thailand as Yawi ( in Thai ) or Jawi ( in Patani Malay ) , and in Kelantan as Baso Kelat\u00e9 , is an Austronesian language of the Malayic subfamily spoken in the Malaysian state of Kelantan and the neighbouring southernmost provinces of Thailand . It is the primary spoken language of Thai Malays , but is also used as a lingua franca by ethnic Southern Thais in rural areas , Muslim and non-Muslim , and the samsam , a mostly Thai-speaking population of mixed Malay and Thai ancestry . Kelantan-Pattani Malay is a highly divergent from other Malay varieties because of its geographical isolation from the rest of the Malay world by high mountains , deep rainforest and the Gulf of Thailand . In Thailand , it is also influenced by Thai . Kelantanese-Pattani Malay is distinct enough that radio broadcasts in Standard Malay can not be understood easily by native speakers of Kelantanese-Pattani Malay who are not taught the standard language , for example , those in Thailand . Unlike Malaysia where Standard Malay is compulsory in the school curriculum , no one is required to learn Standard Malay in Thailand , and so there is potentially less language influence from standard Malay but potentially more from Thai . It is also distinct from Kedah Malay , Pahang Malay and Terengganuan Malay , but those languages still have a close relationship with the Kelantanese-Pattani Malay language .",
  "/wiki/Thailand": "Thailand , [ a ] officially the Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam , [ b ] is a country at the centre of the Southeast Asian Indochinese Peninsula composed of 76 provinces . At 513,120 km2 ( 198,120 sq mi ) and over 68 million people , Thailand is the world 's 50th-largest country by total area and the 21st-most-populous country . The capital and largest city is Bangkok , a special administrative area . Thailand is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos , to the east by Laos and Cambodia , to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia , and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of Myanmar . Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War . Taksin ( r. 1767-1782 ) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom .",

The province is the homeland of the Sundanese people , the second-largest ethnic group in Indonesia after the Javanese . West Java was one of the early eight provinces of Indonesia formed following the country 's independence proclamation and was later legally reestablished on 4 July 1950 . In 1966 , the city of Jakarta was split off from West Java as a 'special capital region ' ( Daerah Khusus Ibukota ) , with a status equivalent to that of a province , while in 2000 the western parts of the province were in turn split away to form a separate Banten province . Even following these split-offs , West Java is the most populous province of Indonesia with a population of 49,316,712 as of mid 2019 . The province 's largest cities , Bekasi and Bandung , are the third and fourth most populous cities proper in Indonesia , respectively . As a satellite city within the Jakarta metropolitan area , Bekasi experiences a highly rapid population growth , having surpassed the West Java capital of Bandung in 2012 .

Historically , it has had a culture distinct from the rest of Java and that of the broader Indonesian archipelago . In recent years , the northern half , particularly those areas near Jakarta and the Java Sea coast , have experienced rapid rises in population and urbanization , while the southern half , particularly that facing the Indian Ocean , maintains more of its traditional character . Centuries ago , the area in what-is-now Banten is ruled by the Sundanese Tarumanagara kingdom . After the fall of the Tarumanegara , Banten was controlled by many Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms , such as the Srivijaya Empire and the Sunda Kingdom . The spread of Islam in the region begins in the 15th century . By the late 16th century , Islam has replaced Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in the province , with the establishment of the Banten Sultanate .",
