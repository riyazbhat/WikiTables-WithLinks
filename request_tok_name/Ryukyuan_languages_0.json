  "/wiki/ISO_639-3": "ISO 639-3:2007 , Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 3 : Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages , is an international standard for language codes in the ISO 639 series . It defines three-letter codes for identifying languages . The standard was published by ISO on 1 February 2007 . ISO 639-3 extends the ISO 639-2 alpha-3 codes with an aim to cover all known natural languages . The extended language coverage was based primarily on the language codes used in the Ethnologue ( volumes 10-14 ) published by SIL International , which is now the registration authority for ISO 639-3 . It provides an enumeration of languages as complete as possible , including living and extinct , ancient and constructed , major and minor , written and unwritten . However , it does not include reconstructed languages such as Proto-Indo-European . ISO 639-3 is intended for use as metadata codes in a wide range of applications . It is widely used in computer and information systems , such as the Internet , in which many languages need to be supported . In archives and other information storage , they are used in cataloging systems , indicating what language a resource is in or about . The codes are also frequently used in the linguistic literature and elsewhere to compensate for the fact that language names may be obscure or ambiguous .",
