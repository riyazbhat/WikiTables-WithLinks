  "/wiki/College_baseball": "College baseball is baseball that is played on the intercollegiate level at institutions of higher education . In comparison to football and basketball , college competition in the United States plays a smaller role in developing professional players , as baseball 's professional minor leagues are more extensive , with a greater history of supplying players to the top professional league . Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball . However , if players do opt to enroll at a four-year college to play baseball , they must complete three years to regain professional eligibility , unless they reach age 21 before starting their third year of college . Players who enroll at junior colleges ( i.e. , two-year institutions ) regain eligibility after one year at that level . In the most recently completed 2017 season , there were 298 NCAA Division I teams in the United States ( including schools transitioning from Division II to Division I ) . As with most other U.S. intercollegiate sports , competitive college baseball is played under the auspices of either the NCAA , the NAIA , or the NJCAA . The NCAA writes the rules of play , while each sanctioning body supervises season-ending tournaments . The final rounds of the NCAA tournaments are known as the College World Series ; one is held on each of the three levels of competition sanctioned by the NCAA . The College World Series for Division I takes place in Omaha , Nebraska in June , following the regular season . The playoff bracket for Division I consists of 64 teams , with four teams playing at each of 16 regional sites ( in a double-elimination format ) . The 16 winners advance to the Super Regionals at eight sites , played head-to-head in a best-of-three series .",
  "/wiki/College_basketball": "College basketball today is governed by collegiate athletic bodies including the United States 's National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) , the United States Collegiate Athletic Association ( USCAA ) , the National Junior College Athletic Association ( NJCAA ) , and the National Christian College Athletic Association ( NCCAA ) . Governing bodies in Canada include U Sports and the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association ( CCAA ) . Each of these various organizations are subdivided into from one to three divisions based on the number and level of scholarships that may be provided to the athletes . Each organization has different conferences to divide up the teams into groups . Teams are selected into these conferences depending on the location of the schools . These conferences are put in due to the regional play of the teams and to have a structural schedule for each to team to play for the upcoming year . During conference play the teams are ranked not only through the entire NCAA , but the conference as well in which they have tournament play leading into the NCAA tournament .",
  "/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling": "Ten-pin bowling is a type of bowling in which a bowler rolls a bowling ball down a wood or synthetic lane toward ten pins positioned in a tetractys ( equilateral triangle-based pattern ) at the far end of the lane . The objective is to knock down all ten pins on the first roll of the ball ( a strike ) , or failing that , on the second roll ( a spare ) . Behind a foul line is an approach approximately 15 feet ( 5 m ) long used to impart speed and apply rotation to the ball . The 41.5-inch-wide ( 105 cm ) , 60-foot-long ( 18 m ) lane is bordered along its length by gutters ( channels ) that collect errant balls . The lane 's long and narrow shape limits straight-line ball paths to angles that are smaller than optimum angles for achieving strikes ; accordingly , many advanced bowlers impart side rotation to hook ( curve ) the ball into the pins . Oil is applied in different patterns to approximately the first two-thirds of the lane 's length to add complexity and regulate challenge in the sport . Especially when coupled with technological developments in ball design since the early 1990s , easier oil patterns , commonly called house shots or typical house patterns ( THPs ) , enable many league bowlers to achieve scores rivaling those of professional bowlers who must bowl on more difficult patterns - a development that has caused substantial controversy . People approach bowling as either a demanding precision sport or as a simple recreational pastime . Following substantial declines since the 1980s in both professional tournament television ratings and amateur league participation , bowling centers have increasingly expanded to become diverse entertainment centers . In most parts of the world , the game is commonly referred to simply as bowling . In Canada and the New England region of the United States , the game is specifically called ten-pin bowling or big-ball bowling to distinguish it from sports with smaller balls such as candlepin bowling , duckpin bowling , and five-pin bowling . In the United Kingdom , it is formally referred to as ten-pin bowling , as bowling can also refer to bowls .",
  "/wiki/Cross_country_running": "Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass . Sometimes the runners are referred to as harriers . The course , typically 4-12 kilometres ( 2.5-7.5 mi ) long , may include surfaces of grass , and earth , pass through woodlands and open country , and include hills , flat ground and sometimes gravel road . It is both an individual and a team sport ; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method . Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country , which usually takes place during autumn and winter , and can include weather conditions of rain , sleet , snow or hail , and a wide range of temperatures . Cross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of athletics , and is a natural terrain version of long-distance track and road running . Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic , the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain . The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the International Cross Country Championships was held for the first time in 1903 . Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the IAAF World Cross Country Championships .",
  "/wiki/Field_hockey": "Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family . The game can be played on grass , watered turf , artificial turf or synthetic field , as well as an indoor boarded surface . Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper . Players commonly use sticks made out of wood , carbon fibre , fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities ( with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break ) to hit a round , hard , plastic hockey ball . The length of the hockey stick is based on the player 's individual height , the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip , taller players typically have taller sticks . The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used , if the other side is used it results in a foul . Goalies often have a different kind of stick , however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick . The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick , this is to give them more surface area to save the ball . The uniform consists of shin guards , shoes , shorts or a skirt , a mouthguard and a jersey . Today , the game is played globally , mainly in parts of Western Europe , South Asia , Southern Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Argentina , and parts of the United States ( primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states ) . Known simply as hockey in many territories , the term field hockey is used primarily in Canada and the United States where ice hockey is more popular . In Sweden , the term landhockey is used and to some degree also in Norway where it is governed by Norway 's Bandy Association .",
  "/wiki/College_football": "College football is gridiron football consisting of American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities , colleges , and military academies , or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities . It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States . Unlike most other sports in North America , no minor league farm organizations exist in American or Canadian football . Therefore , college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American football in the United States and Canadian football in Canada ; one step ahead of high school competition , and one step below professional competition . However , in some areas of the country , college football is more popular than professional football , and for much of the early 20th century , college football was seen as more prestigious than professional football . It is in college football where a player 's performance directly impacts his chances of playing professional football . The best collegiate players will typically declare for the professional draft after three to four years of collegiate competition , with the NFL holding its annual draft every spring in which 256 players are selected annually . Those not selected can still attempt to land an NFL roster spot as an undrafted free agent .",
  "/wiki/Golf": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible . Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 . Golf 's first major , and the world 's oldest tournament in existence , is The Open Championship , also known as the British Open , which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire , Scotland . This is one of the four major championships in men 's professional golf , the other three being played in the United States : The Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship .",

  "/wiki/Softball": "Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball ( 11 to 12 in . circumference ) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet , a pitcher 's mound that ranges from 35-43 feet away from home plate , and a homerun fence that is 220 feet away from home plate . It was invented in 1887 in Chicago , Illinois , United States as an indoor game . The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball . There is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball ; yet , the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base . The name softball was given to the game in 1932 , because the ball used to be soft ; however , in modern-day usage , the balls are hard . A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World 's Fair spurred interest in the game . The Amateur Softball Association ( ASA ) of America ( founded 1933 ) is one of the largest governing bodies for the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships . Other national and regional governing bodies also exist , including the USSSA . The World Baseball Softball Confederation ( WBSC ) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries , including the United States and Canada ; before the WBSC was formed in 2013 , the International Softball Federation filled this role . Women 's fast pitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996 , but it and baseball were dropped from the 2012 program ; they are to be reinstated in 2020 . There are three types of softball .",
  "/wiki/Swimming_(sport)": "Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one 's entire body to move through water . The sport takes place in pools or open water ( e.g. , in a sea or lake ) . Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports , with varied distance events in butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , freestyle , and individual medley . In addition to these individual events , four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay . A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke , ordered as backstroke , breaststroke , butterfly and freestyle . Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques ; in competition , there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke . There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits , caps , jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions . Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport , such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees , there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport .",

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",
  "/wiki/Track_and_field": "Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running , jumping , and throwing . The name is derived from where the sport takes place , a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events . Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics , which also includes road running , cross country running , and racewalking . The foot racing events , which include sprints , middle- and long-distance events , racewalking and hurdling , are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time . The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height . Regular jumping events include long jump , triple jump , high jump and pole vault , while the most common throwing events are shot put , javelin , discus and hammer . There are also combined events or multi events , such as the pentathlon consisting of five events , heptathlon consisting of seven events , and decathlon consisting of ten events . In these , athletes participate in a combination of track and field events . Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor ; the most prominent team events are relay races , which typically feature teams of four . Events are almost exclusively divided by gender , although both the men 's and women 's competitions are usually held at the same venue . If a race has too many people to run all at once , preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants . Track and field is one of the oldest sports .",
  "/wiki/Volleyball": "Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net . Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team 's court under organized rules . It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964 . The complete set of rules are extensive , but play essentially proceeds as follows : a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally ' by serving the ball ( tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm ) , from behind the back boundary line of the court , over the net , and into the receiving team 's court . The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times , but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court . The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either ( 1 ) : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or ( 2 ) : a team commits a fault and loses the rally . The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally . A few of the most common faults include :"
