  "/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner": "Wile E. Coyote ( also known simply as the Coyote ) and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . In each episode , the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner , a fast-running ground bird , but is never successful . Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex . The characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese in 1948 for Warner Bros. , while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese . The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts ( the first 16 of which were written by Maltese ) and occasional made-for-television cartoons .",

  "/wiki/Ready,_Set,_Zoom!": "Introduction : The Road Runner is in the middle of the road , and after surveying his surroundings , dashes at hyperspeed onto a low plateau ( Speedipus Rex ) , then continues to mountain roads and leaves dust clouds everywhere . Meanwhile , Wile E. Coyote ( Famishus-Famishus ) emerges from his cave after a good-night 's sleep and is soon fully awoken by a Beep-beep . He peeks over the plateau to see the Road Runner at the bottom and strides down the vertical edge with eating utensils , in pursuit of breakfast . The Road Runner taunts his nemesis by dodging at the last possible moment , allowing the coyote to slam into the rock floor . The chase moves to the real roads , and the Road Runner taunts him with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 187 , disappearing beyond the 10 mile horizon in only 6 frames of film , causing Wile E. 's entire jaw to hang open and then drop out as he enters a cloud . The coyote trails dust as he reclines on a low rock to dream his next plan . 1 . Wile E. covers an entire section of a canyon with glue , making sure to leave space for himself to stand . However , the approaching Beep-beep belongs to a truck and not the Road Runner , and thus the coyote lacks sufficient time to escape the glue ; he tries anyway and can not leap far enough before he gets stuck , and can only watch as he is flattened . Wile E. thus tries another method : covering a low rockface with glue and preparing , from a distance , to throw dynamite at the Road Runner . However , the bird 's velocity causes the glue to part sideways , drowning Wile E. in his hiding place and preventing him from throwing the dynamite . After failing at this and at blowing out the fuse , he begins walking with his hips ( his legs are glued to the stick ) in an effort to allow the wind to snuff or slow the burning fuse , then jumps into a nearby river ; however , the explosive detonates about three feet above , and the coyote pauses in midair before he falls into the water .",
