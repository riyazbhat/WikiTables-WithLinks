  "/wiki/U.S._Men's_Clay_Court_Championships": "The U.S. Men 's Clay Court Championship is an annual ATP Tour tennis tournament that started in 1910 . It is the last remaining ATP World Tour-level tournament in the United States to be played on clay courts . The tournament began in 1910 when the Western Lawn Tennis Association ( a section of the United States Lawn Tennis Association now known as the USTA/Midwest ) lobbied the USLTA that a National Clay Court Championship would help promote the establishment of more clay courts in the West . Clay courts were more economical to install and maintain than grass courts , and the hope was that the lower costs associated with court construction would allow for a more rapid expansion of the game . The first National Clay Court Championships were held at the Omaha Field Club with a crowd of 5,000 watching the finals . Participation and play on clay grew as a result of the event and others , and in 1914 the event was moved to the Cincinnati Tennis Club . It has since been played in numerous cities , with long stints in River Forest and Indianapolis , and is today held in Houston , Texas . Between 1970 and 1989 it was part of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour as part of the Grand Prix Super Series of events ( 1974-1977 ) .",
