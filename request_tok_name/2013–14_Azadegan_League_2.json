Ali was born inside the sacred sanctuary of the Kaaba in Mecca , the holiest place in Islam , to Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad . He was the first male who accepted Islam under Muhammad 's watch .

Ali 's reign saw civil wars and in 661 , he was attacked and assassinated by a Kharijite while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa . Ali is important to both Shi'ites and Sunnis , politically and spiritually . The numerous biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines , but they agree that he was a pious Muslim , devoted to the cause of Islam and a just ruler in accordance with the Qur'an and the Sunnah . While Sunnis consider Ali the fourth and final of the Rashidun ( rightly guided ) caliphs , Shia Muslims regard Ali as the first Imam after Muhammad due to their interpretation of the events at Ghadir Khumm .
