  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/EMD_SD7": "An SD7 is a 6-axle road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between May 1951 and November 1953 . It had an EMD 567B 16-cylinder engine producing 1,500 horsepower ( 1.12 MW ) for its six traction motors . 188 were built for United States railroads . Starting in August 1953 a total of 26 SD7s were produced which used either the 567BC engine or the 567C engine . These units are noted on the roster below . This was the first model in EMD 's SD ( Special Duty ) series of locomotives , a lengthened B-B GP7 with a C-C truck arrangement . The two extra axles and traction motors are useful in heavy , low speed freight service . SD series locomotives are still being produced today , with the SD70 being the most popular example in current production , and with many SD40-2s and rebuilds to SD40-2 specifications , or SD60s still in operation . Yesterday 's Special Duty eventually became today 's Standard Duty , and yesterday 's General Purpose has become today 's Special Purpose ( time freight and other time-sensitive lading ) . True GPs were discontinued after the completion of the last GP60 in 1994 . Recently intermodal and other fast freights may be hauled by 6 axles locomotives with 4 powered axles , such as the SD70ACe-P4 . Many SD7s both high and short-hood can still be found in service today on shortline railroads and industrial operators , although most Class 1 roads stopped using these locomotives by the 1970s and 1980s .",

This model is , externally , similar to its predecessor , the SD7 , but this model , internally , features the improved and much more maintainable 567C engine . The principal spotting feature are the classification lights on the ends of the locomotive , above the number board . The SD9 's classification lights are on a small pod , canted outward . The last phase of construction had a carbody similar to the SD18 and SD24 , and used two 48-inch ( 1,219 mm ) cooling fans instead of four 36-inch ( 914 mm ) cooling fans . Four hundred and seventy-one SD9s were built for American railroads and 44 for export . Many SD9s both high and short-hood can still be found in service today on shortline railroads and industrial operators .

  "/wiki/EMD_SD24": "The EMD SD24 was a 2,400 hp ( 1,800 kW ) six-axle ( C-C ) road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division of La Grange , Illinois between July 1958 and March 1963 . A total of 224 units were built for customers in the United States , comprising 179 regular , cab-equipped locomotives and 45 cabless B units . The latter were built solely for the Union Pacific Railroad . The SD24 was the first EMD production locomotive to be built with an EMD turbocharged diesel engine . The first SD24 was built sixteen months before the four-axle ( B-B ) model GP20 . Power output of the SD24 was 33 percent higher than the 1,800 hp ( 1,340 kW ) of the concurrent Roots blower-equipped SD18s with the same engine displacement . The SD24 had 400 hp ( 298 kW ) per axle , limited by the traction motors then available . Nevertheless , the turbocharged SD24 provided full rated power at all altitudes , which the Roots-blown SD18 could not provide . In terms of sales , the SD24 was only a moderate success , and had average service lives in SD24 configuration ( though a few deturbocharged rebuilds are still in operation ) , but the SD24 was a milestone in EMD locomotive development and the forerunner to today 's high-powered six-axle locomotives . EMD thought the Duluth , Missabe & Iron Range Railway would want to start purchasing the SD24 and sent the first demonstrator to the DMIR painted in the road 's livery . The DMIR did not end up purchasing the SD24 and the demonstrator went to the Union Pacific Railroad .",

  "/wiki/Steam_generator_(railroad)": "A steam generator is a type of boiler used to produce steam for climate control and potable water heating in railroad passenger cars . The output of a railroad steam generator is low pressure , saturated steam that is passed through a system of pipes and conduits throughout the length of the train . Steam generators were developed when diesel locomotives started to replace steam locomotives on passenger trains . In most cases , each passenger locomotive was fitted with a steam generator and a feedwater supply tank . The steam generator used some of the locomotive 's diesel fuel supply for combustion . When a steam generator-equipped locomotive was not available for a run , a so-called heating car fitted with one or two steam generators was inserted between the last locomotive in the consist and the rest of the train . Steam generators would also be fitted to individual cars to enable them to be heated independently of any locomotive supply . In Ireland , C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann used heating cars as standard and CI\u00c9 diesel locomotives were not fitted with steam generators .",

  "/wiki/EMD_645": "The EMD 645 family of diesel engines was designed and manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors . While the 645 series was intended primarily for locomotive , marine and stationary engine use , one 16-cylinder version powered the 33-19 Titan prototype haul truck designed by GM 's Terex division . The 645 series was an evolution of the earlier 567 series and a precursor to the later 710 series . First introduced in 1965 , the EMD 645 series remained in production on a by-request basis long after it was replaced by the 710 , and most 645 service parts are still in production . The EMD 645 engine series is currently supported by Electro-Motive Diesel , Inc. , which purchased the assets of the Electro-Motive Division from General Motors in 2005 . In 1951 , E. W. Kettering wrote a paper for the ASME entitled , History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine , which goes into great detail about the technical obstacles that were encountered during the development of the 567 engine . These same considerations apply to the 645 and 710 , as these engines were a logical extension of the 567C , by applying a cylinder bore increase , 645 , and a cylinder bore increase and a stroke increase , 710 , to achieve a greater power output , without changing the external size of the engines , or their weight , thereby achieving significant improvements in horsepower per unit volume and horsepower per unit weight .",
