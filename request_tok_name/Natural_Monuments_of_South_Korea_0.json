China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

Joseon was founded by Yi Seong-gye in July 1392 and was replaced by the Korean Empire in October 1897 . It was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of Goryeo in what is today the city of Kaesong . Early on , Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day Seoul . The kingdom 's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amnok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens . Joseon was the last dynasty of Korea and its longest-ruling Confucian dynasty . During its reign , Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Chinese Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society . Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new dynasty 's state ideology . Buddhism was accordingly discouraged and occasionally faced persecutions by the dynasty . Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea and saw the height of classical Korean culture , trade , literature , and science and technology . However , the dynasty was severely weakened during the late 16th and early 17th centuries , when the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s and the first and second Manchu invasions nearly overran the Korean Peninsula , leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy , for which the country became known as the hermit kingdom in Western literature .",

Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day .

  "/wiki/Habitat": "In ecology , a habitat is the type of natural environment in which a particular species of organism lives . It is characterized by both physical and biological features . A species 's habitat is those places where it can find food , shelter , protection and mates for reproduction . The physical factors are for example soil , moisture , range of temperature , and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and the presence or absence of predators . Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive , but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements . A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area , it can be the interior of a stem , a rotten log , a rock or a clump of moss , and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host , part of the host 's body such as the digestive tract , or a single cell within the host 's body . Habitat types include polar , temperate , subtropical and tropical . The terrestrial vegetation type may be forest , steppe , grassland , semi-arid or desert . Fresh water habitats include marshes , streams , rivers , lakes , and ponds , and marine habitats include salt marshes , the coast , the intertidal zone , estuaries , reefs , bays , the open sea , the sea bed , deep water and submarine vents . Habitats change over time . This may be due to a violent event such as the eruption of a volcano , an earthquake , a tsunami , a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents ; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the climate , as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat , and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation . Other changes come as a direct result of human activities ; deforestation , the plowing of ancient grasslands , the diversion and damming of rivers , the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed .",

  "/wiki/Virgin_forest": "An old-growth forest - also termed primary forest , virgin forest , primeval forest , late seral forest , or forest primeval - is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community .

The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps , greatly varying tree heights and diameters , and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris . Old-growth forests are valuable for economic reasons and for the ecosystem services they provide . This can be a point of contention when some in the logging industry desire to cut down the forests to obtain valuable timber , while environmentalists seek to preserve the forests for benefits such as maintenance of biodiversity , water purification , flood control , and nutrient cycling .

  "/wiki/Windbreak": "A windbreak ( shelterbelt ) is a planting usually made up of one or more rows of trees or shrubs planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the wind and to protect soil from erosion . They are commonly planted in hedgerows around the edges of fields on farms . If designed properly , windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save energy . Windbreaks are also planted to help keep snow from drifting onto roadways or yards . Farmers sometimes use windbreaks to keep snow drifts on farm land that will provide water when the snow melts in the spring . Other benefits include contributing to a microclimate around crops ( with slightly less drying and chilling at night ) , providing habitat for wildlife , and , in some regions , providing wood if the trees are harvested . Windbreaks and intercropping can be combined in a farming practice referred to as alleycropping . Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees . These trees provide fruit , wood , or protect the crops from the wind . Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India , Africa , and Brazil , where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry . A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway . This improves the farm landscape by reducing the visual incursion of the motorway , mitigating noise from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and the road .",

  "/wiki/Typhoons": "A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180\u00b0 and 100\u00b0E in the Northern Hemisphere . This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin , and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth , accounting for almost one-third of the world 's annual tropical cyclones . For organizational purposes , the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions : the eastern ( North America to 140\u00b0W ) , central ( 140\u00b0W to 180\u00b0 ) , and western ( 180\u00b0 to 100\u00b0E ) . The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center ( RSMC ) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan , with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii ( the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ) , the Philippines and Hong Kong . While the RSMC names each system , the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year . Within the northwestern Pacific , there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year . Like any tropical cyclone , there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development : ( 1 ) sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures , ( 2 ) atmospheric instability , ( 3 ) high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere , ( 4 ) enough Coriolis effect to develop a low pressure center , ( 5 ) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance , and ( 6 ) a low vertical wind shear . While the majority of storms form between June and November , a few storms do occur between December and May ( although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time ) . On average , the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally . Like other basins , they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest , with some systems recurving near and east of Japan . The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls , with China and Japan being impacted slightly less . Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China .",

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) ."
