  "/wiki/Aries_(astrology)": "Aries ( \u2648 ) /\u02c8\u025b\u0259ri\u02d0z/ ( Latin for ram ) is the first astrological sign in the zodiac , spanning the first 30 degrees of celestial longitude ( 0\u00b0\u2264 \u03bb < 30\u00b0 ) , and originates from the constellation of the same name . Under the tropical zodiac , the Sun transits this sign from approximately March 20 to April 21 each year . This time duration is exactly the first month of the Solar Hijri calendar ( Hamal/Farvardin/Wray ) . According to the tropical system of astrology , the Sun enters the sign of Aries when it reaches the March equinox , which occurs on average on March 21 ( by design ) . Because the Earth takes approximately 365.24 days to go around the Sun , the precise time of the equinox is not the same each year , and generally will occur about six hours later from one year to the next until reset by a leap year . February 29 of a leap year causes that year 's vernal equinox to fall about eighteen hours earlier - according to the calendar - compared with the previous year . From 1800 to 2050 inclusive the vernal equinox date has ( or will ) range ( d ) from March 19 at 22:34 UT1 in 2048 to March 21 at 19:15 UT1 in 1903 . Under the sidereal zodiac , the sun currently [ when ? ] transits Aries from April 15 to 14 May ( approximately ) .",
