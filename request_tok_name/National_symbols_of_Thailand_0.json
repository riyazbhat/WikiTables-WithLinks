Three subspecies are recognised - E. m. maximus from Sri Lanka , E. m. indicus from mainland Asia and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra . The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia . Since 1986 , the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List , as the population has declined by at least 50 percent over the last three generations , estimated to be 60-75 years . It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat , habitat degradation , fragmentation and poaching . In 2003 , the wild population was estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals . Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings , such as forest camps . In zoos , Asian elephants die at a much younger age ; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate . The genus Elephas originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene and spread throughout Africa before expanding into the southern half of Asia . The earliest indications of captive use of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley Civilisation dated to the 3rd millennium BC .",

His son , Rama II , rewrote some parts of his father 's version for khon drama . The work has had an important influence on Thai literature , art and drama ( both the khon and nang dramas being derived from it ) . While the main story is identical to that of the Ramayana , many other aspects were transposed into a Thai context , such as the clothes , weapons , topography , and elements of nature , which are described as being Thai in style . Although Thailand is considered a Theravada Buddhist society , the Hindu mythology latent in the Ramakien serves to provide Thai legends with a creation myth , as well as representations of various spirits which complement beliefs derived from Thai animism . A painted representation of the Ramakien is displayed at Bangkok 's Wat Phra Kaew , and many of the statues there depict characters from it .",
