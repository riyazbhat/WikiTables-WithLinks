Indeed , the early 13th century document known to modern scholars as the de Situ Albanie repeats the claim that Atholl was an ancient Pictish kingdom .

Royal connections continued with M\u00e1el Muire , who was the son of King Donnchad I , and the younger brother of M\u00e1el Coluim III mac Donnchada . Matad was perhaps the most famous of the Mormaers , fathering Harald Maddadsson , a notorious rebel of the Scottish King and perhaps the first Gael to rule Orkney as Earl of Orkney .
