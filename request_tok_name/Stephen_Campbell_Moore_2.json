Edward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York , later King George V and Queen Mary . He was created Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday , nine weeks after his father succeeded as king . As a young man , Edward served in the British Army during the First World War and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father . While Prince of Wales , he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the British Prime Minister , Stanley Baldwin . Edward became king on his father 's death . As king , he showed impatience with court protocol , and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions . Only months into his reign , he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing to Wallis Simpson , an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second . The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage , arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort . Additionally , such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward 's status as the titular head of the Church of England , which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive . Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead , which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch . When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne , he abdicated .",
