  "/wiki/Lammergeier": "The bearded vulture ( Gypaetus barbatus ) , also known as the lammergeier ( or lammergeyer ) [ a ] or ossifrage , is a bird of prey and the only member of the genus Gypaetus . Traditionally considered an Old World vulture , it actually forms a minor lineage of Accipitridae together with the Egyptian vulture ( Neophron percnopterus ) , its closest living relative . It is not much more closely related to the Old World vultures proper than to , for example , hawks , and differs from the former by its feathered neck . Although dissimilar , the Egyptian and bearded vulture each have a lozenge-shaped tail - unusual among birds of prey . The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate whose diet consists almost exclusively ( 70 to 90 percent ) of bone . It lives and breeds on crags in high mountains in southern Europe , the Caucasus , Africa , the Indian subcontinent , and Tibet , laying one or two eggs in mid-winter that hatch at the beginning of spring . Populations are residents . The population of this species continues to decline . Until July 2014 , it was classified by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as being of Least Concern ; it has , however , since been reassessed as Near Threatened .",

Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica , closely related parrots . Adult falcons have thin , tapered wings , which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly . Fledgling falcons , in their first year of flying , have longer flight feathers , which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broad-wing . This makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults . There are many different types of falcon . The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae , which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species . All these birds kill with their beaks , using a tooth on the side of their beaks - unlike the hawks , eagles , and other birds of prey in the Accipitridae , which use their feet . The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm in length . The smallest falcons are the kestrels , of which the Seychelles kestrel measures just 25 cm . As with hawks and owls , falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism , with the females typically larger than the males , thus allowing a wider range of prey species . Some small falcons with long , narrow wings are called hobbies and some which hover while hunting are called kestrels .",

Its latitudinal limits fall around the tree line in the Arctic and the species is absent from the high Arctic . It is legally protected in Canada , Mexico , and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . The 14 recognized subspecies vary in appearance and range , varying most often in color , and in the west of North America , red-tails are particularly often strongly polymorphic , with individuals ranging from almost white to nearly all black . The subspecies Harlan 's hawk ( B. j. harlani ) is sometimes considered a separate species ( B. harlani ) . The red-tailed hawk is one of the largest members of the genus Buteo , typically weighing from 690 to 1,600 g ( 1.5 to 3.5 lb ) and measuring 45-65 cm ( 18-26 in ) in length , with a wingspan from 110-141 cm ( 3 ft 7 in-4 ft 8 in ) .

Woody was originally voiced by prolific voice actor Mel Blanc , who was succeeded by Danny Webb , Kent Rogers , Ben Hardaway and finally Grace Stafford ( wife of Walter Lantz ) .

  "/wiki/Vultures": "A vulture is a scavenging bird of prey . The two types of vultures are the New World vultures , including the Californian and Andean condors , and the Old World vultures , including the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains . Some traditional Old World vultures ( including the bearded vulture ) are not closely related to the others , which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two . New World vultures are found in North and South America ; Old World vultures are found in Europe , Africa , and Asia , meaning that between the two groups , vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica ( though Trigonoceps vultures have crossed the Wallace line ) . A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head , devoid of normal feathers . Although it has been historically believed to help keep the head clean when feeding , the bare skin may play an important role in thermoregulation . Vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold , and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat . Vultures also use urine as a way to keep themselves cool by urinating on themselves . A group of vultures is called a kettle , committee or wake . The term kettle refers to vultures in flight , while committee refers to vultures resting on the ground or in trees . Wake is reserved for a group of vultures that are feeding . The word Geier ( taken from the German language ) does not have a precise meaning in ornithology ; it is occasionally used to refer to a vulture in English , as in some poetry .",
