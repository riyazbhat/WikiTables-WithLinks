It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror .

At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries .

Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
  "/wiki/British_Empire": "The British Empire comprised the dominions , colonies , protectorates , mandates , and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states . It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries . At its height , it was the largest empire in history and , for over a century , was the foremost global power . By 1913 , the British Empire held sway over 412 million people , 23% of the world population at the time , and by 1920 , it covered 35,500,000 km2 ( 13,700,000 sq mi ) , 24% of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic , and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . Envious of the great wealth these empires generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia . A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then , following union between England and Scotland in 1707 , Great Britain , the dominant colonial power in North America . It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company 's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies .

Until the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 , the Kingdom was only nominally independent , since the British retained control of foreign relations , communications , the military and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . Between 1936 and 1952 , the British continued to maintain military presence and political advisers , at a reduced level . The legal status of Egypt had been highly convoluted , due to its de facto breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in 1805 , its occupation by Britain in 1882 , and its transformation into a sultanate and British protectorate in 1914 . In line with the change in status from sultanate to kingdom , the Sultan of Egypt , Fuad I , saw his title changed to King . The kingdom 's sovereignty was subject to severe limitations imposed by the British , who retained enormous control over Egyptian affairs , and whose military continued to occupy the country . Throughout the kingdom 's existence , the Sudan was formally united with Egypt . However , actual Egyptian authority in the Sudan was largely nominal due to Britain 's role as the dominant power in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . During the reign of King Fuad , the monarchy struggled with the Wafd Party , a broadly based nationalist political organization strongly opposed to British domination , and with the British themselves , who were determined to maintain control over the Suez Canal . Other political forces emerging in this period included the Communist Party ( 1925 ) , and the Muslim Brotherhood ( 1928 ) , which eventually became a potent political and religious force . King Fuad died in 1936 and Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen . Alarmed by the Kingdom of Italy 's recent invasion of Abyssinia , he signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty , requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt , except in the Suez Canal Zone ( agreed to be evacuated by 1949 ) .",

The treaties of San Stefano and Berlin both assigned areas that were also inhabited by Albanians to other states .

The areas today comprising Sand\u017eak ( Ra\u0161ka ) region of Serbia and Montenegro , although de jure under Ottoman control , were in fact under Austro- Hungarian occupation from 1878 until 1909 , as provided under Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin . Uskub ( Skopje ) functioned as the capital of the province and the mid way point between Istanbul and its European provinces . Uskub 's population of 32,000 made it the largest city in the province , followed by Prizren , also numbering at 30,000 . The Vilayet stood as a microcosm of Ottoman society ; incorporated within its boundaries were diverse groups of peoples and religions : Albanians , Serbs , Bosniaks ; Muslims and Christians , both Orthodox and Catholic . The province was renowned for its craftsmen and important cities such as \u0130pek ( today 's Pe\u0107 , Albanian : Peja ) , where distinct Ottoman architecture and public baths were erected , some of which can still be seen today . The birthplace of the Albanian national identity was first articulated in Prizren , by the League of Prizren members in 1878 . As a result , firstly of the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 , then of the modified Treaty of Berlin the same year which split the Ottoman Empire , Kosovo became the first line of defense for the Ottoman Empire , with large garrisons of Ottoman troops being stationed in the province . Before the First Balkan War in 1912 , the province 's shape and location denied Serbia and Montenegro a common land border . After the war , the major part of the vilayet was divided between Montenegro and Serbia . These borders were all ratified at the Treaty of London in 1913 . The Ottoman Empire finally recognised the new borders following a peace deal with the Kingdom of Serbia on 14 March 1914 .",

The vilayet was occupied during the First Balkan War in 1912 and divided between the Kingdom of Greece and the Kingdom of Serbia , with some parts later becoming part of the newly established Principality of Albania ."
