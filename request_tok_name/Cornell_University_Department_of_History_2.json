  "/wiki/George_Lincoln_Burr": "George Lincoln Burr ( January 30 , 1857 - June 27 , 1938 ) was a U.S. historian , diplomat , author , and educator , best known as a Professor of History and Librarian at Cornell University , and as the closest collaborator of Andrew Dickson White , the first President of Cornell . Burr was born in Albany , New York and entered the Cortland Academy in 1869 , where he first met Andrew Dickson White , who was guest speaker for its 50th anniversary . The financial Panic of 1873 wreaked havoc on his family 's finances , and he was forced to leave school and seek employment at age 16 . After a brief stint as a schoolmaster , he apprenticed as a printer of The Standard at Cortland . After 4 years , he had saved $ 200 , sufficient for him to matriculate at Cornell in 1877 . As a sophomore , Burr audited a course for seniors taught by White on the historical development of criminal law , and received permission to sit for the exam . Prof. White was so impressed by Burr 's exam answers that he secretly appointed Burr as his examiner ( i.e. , grader ) in history . White writes in his Autobiography , Of course this was kept entirely secret ; for had the Seniors known that I had entrusted their papers to the tender mercies of a Sophomore , they would probably have mobbed me . After his graduation in 1881 , Burr accepted White 's offer to serve as an instructor and examiner in modern history , and also as White 's private secretary . This was the beginning of a literary partnership that lasted until White 's death in 1918 . Under White 's tutelage , Burr developed into a scholar of medieval history . After traveling and studying in Switzerland , France , and Germany , Burr was appointed to the Cornell faculty in 1888 .",
