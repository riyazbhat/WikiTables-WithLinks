The new state , officially named Romania since 1866 , gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877 . Following World War I after declaring its neutrality in 1914 , when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916 , Bukovina , Bessarabia , Transylvania as well as parts of Banat , Cri\u0219ana , and Maramure\u0219 became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania . In June-August 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union , and Northern Transylvania to Hungary . In November 1940 , Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and , consequently , in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side , fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944 , when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania .",

Since 2011 , Sudan has been the scene of an ongoing military conflict in its southern states . Sudan 's history goes back to the Pharaonic period , witnessing the kingdom of Kerma ( c. 2500 BC-1500 BC ) , the subsequent rule of the Egyptian New Kingdom ( c. 1500 BC-1070 BC ) and the rise of the kingdom of Kush ( c. 785 BC-350 AD ) , which would in turn control Egypt itself for nearly a century . After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 . Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads . From the 16th-19th centuries , central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate , while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the far north .

  "/wiki/Norandrosterone": "19-Norandrosterone , also known as 5\u03b1-estran-3\u03b1-ol-17-one , is a metabolite of nandrolone ( 19-nortestosterone ) and bolandione ( 19-norandrostenedione ) that is formed by 5\u03b1-reductase . It is on the list of substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since it is a detectable metabolite of nandrolone , an anabolic-androgenic steroid ( AAS ) . Consumption of androstendione products contaminated with traces of bolandione may also result in testing positive for nandrolone . Traces of 19-norandrosterone may be naturally present in human urine . An experiment conducted on athletes showed that after a prolonged intense effort , the 19-norandrosterone concentration can be increased by a factor varying between 2 and 4 , but another study failed to replicate the result . Concentration also increases in the urine of female athletes during menstruation . The consumption of edible parts of a non-castrated pig , containing 19-nortestosterone , has been shown to result in the excretion of 19-norandrosterone in the following hours , so athletes should prudently avoid meals composed of pig offal in the hours preceding doping tests . Consumption of boar meat , liver , kidneys and heart also increased 19-norandrosterone output .",

  "/wiki/Biological_passport": "An athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes , in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time . Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athletes established levels outside permissible limits , rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances . Although the terminology athlete passport is recent , the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping . Maybe the first marker of doping , that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood , but through the induced deviations in biological parameters , is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio ( T/E ) . The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples . A decade later , in 1997 , markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations , such as the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) and the Federation Internationale de Ski , to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time . It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term athlete passport .

Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers , levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine , in their pure amine forms . The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers , or to either of them alone . Historically , it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression . Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries , and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use . [ sources 1 ] The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions . Currently , pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine , Adderall , [ note 3 ] dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain , with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems . [ sources 2 ] At therapeutic doses , amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in desire for sex , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control .

It is taken by mouth or held in the cheek or under the tongue . Side effects of methyltestosterone include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . It can also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention , breast tenderness , and breast enlargement in men and liver damage . The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . It has moderate androgenic effects and moderate anabolic effects , which make it useful for producing masculinization . Methyltestosterone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in 1936 . It was made shortly after the discovery of testosterone and was one of the first synthetic AAS to be developed . In addition to its medical use , methyltestosterone is used to improve physique and performance , although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for such purposes due to its androgenic effects , estrogenic effects , and risk of liver damage . The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit .",

  "/wiki/Stanazolol": "Stanozolol ( abbrev . Stz ) , sold under many brand names , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) medication which was derived from dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , it is used to treat hereditary angioedema . It was developed by American pharmaceutical company Winthrop Laboratories ( Sterling Drug ) in 1962 , and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use , though it is no longer marketed in the USA . It is also used in veterinary medicine . Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued , and remains available in only a few countries . It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals . Unlike most injectable AAS , stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension , or in oral tablet form . The drug has a high oral bioavailability , due to a C17\u03b1 alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested . It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form . Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) and many other sporting bodies . Additionally , stanozolol has been used in US horse racing ."
