Nokia 's headquarters are in Espoo , in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area . In 2018 , Nokia employed approximately 103,000 people across over 100 countries , did business in more than 130 countries , and reported annual revenues of around \u20ac23 billion . Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange . It is the world 's 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500 , having peaked at 85th place in 2009 . It is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index . The company has operated in various industries over the past 150 years . It was founded as a pulp mill and had long been associated with rubber and cables , but since the 1990s has focused on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures , technology development , and licensing . Nokia is a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry , having assisted in the development of the GSM , 3G and LTE standards ( and currently in 5G ) , and was once the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones . After a partnership with Microsoft and subsequent market struggles , its mobile phone business was bought by Microsoft , creating Microsoft Mobile as its successor in 2014 . After the sale , Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on Internet of things technologies , marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent , including its Bell Labs research organization . The company then also experimented with virtual reality and digital health , the latter through the purchase of Withings .",

It is the world 's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip manufacturer based on revenue , and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors , the processors found in most personal computers ( PCs ) . Intel ranked No . 46 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue . Intel is incorporated in Delaware . Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple , Lenovo , HP , and Dell . Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets , network interface controllers and integrated circuits , flash memory , graphics chips , embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing . Intel Corporation was founded on July 18 , 1968 , by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore ( of Moore 's law ) , and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove . The company 's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics , with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit ( microchip ) . The fact that intel is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate . Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips , which represented the majority of its business until 1981 . Although Intel created the world 's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971 , it was not until the success of the personal computer ( PC ) that this became its primary business .",
  "/wiki/Free_software": "Free software or libre software is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study , change , and distribute it and any adapted versions . Free software is a matter of liberty , not price : users - individually or in cooperation with computer programmers - are free to do what they want with their copies of a free software ( including profiting from them ) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program . Computer programs are deemed free if they give users ( not just the developer ) ultimate control over the software and , subsequently , over their devices . The right to study and modify a computer program entails that source code - the preferred format for making changes - be made available to users of that program . While this is often called access to source code or public availability , the Free Software Foundation recommends against thinking in those terms , because it might give the impression that users have an obligation ( as opposed to a right ) to give non-users a copy of the program . Although the term free software had already been used loosely in the past , Richard Stallman is credited with tying it to the sense under discussion and starting the free-software movement in 1983 , when he launched the GNU Project : a collaborative effort to create a freedom-respecting operating system , and to revive the spirit of cooperation once prevalent among hackers during the early days of computing .",
  "/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services": "Active Directory Federation Services ( AD FS ) , a software component developed by Microsoft , can run on Windows Server operating systems to provide users with single sign-on access to systems and applications located across organizational boundaries . It uses a claims-based access-control authorization model to maintain application security and to implement federated identity . Claims-based authentication involves authenticating a user based on a set of claims about that user 's identity contained in a trusted token . Such a token is often issued and signed by an entity that is able to authenticate the user by other means , and that is trusted by the entity doing the claims-based authentication . It is part of the Active Directory Services . In AD FS , identity federation is established between two organizations by establishing trust between two security realms . A federation server on one side ( the Accounts side ) authenticates the user through the standard means in Active Directory Domain Services and then issues a token containing a series of claims about the user , including its identity . On the other side , the Resources side , another federation server validates the token and issues another token for the local servers to accept the claimed identity . This allows a system to provide controlled access to its resources or services to a user that belongs to another security realm without requiring the user to authenticate directly to the system and without the two systems sharing a database of user identities or passwords . In practice a user might typically perceive this approach as follows :",

  "/wiki/Single_sign_on": "Single sign-on ( SSO ) is a property of access control of multiple related , yet independent , software systems . With this property , a user logs in with a single ID and password to gain access to any of several related systems . It is often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( LDAP ) and stored LDAP databases on ( directory ) servers . A simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain . For clarity , a distinction should be made between Directory Server Authentication and single sign-on : Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server , whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications . Conversely , single sign-off or single log-out ( SLO ) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems . As different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms , single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms . Other shared authentication schemes such as OpenID , and OpenID Connect offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource , but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services ( such as user consent ) are disabled . An increasing number of federated social logons , like Facebook Connect , do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource , and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense .",

Administrators can configure DACS to identify users by employing authentication methods and user accounts already available within their organization . The resulting DACS identities are recognized at all DACS jurisdictions that have been federated . In addition to simple web-based APIs , command-line interfaces are also provided to much of the functionality . Most web-based APIs can return XML or JSON documents .

If the user - after having received the LTPA token - accesses a server that is a member of the same authentication realm as the first server , and if the browsing session has not been terminated ( the browser was not closed down ) , then the user is automatically authenticated and will not be challenged for a name and password .
