  "/wiki/Gene": "In biology , a gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the synthesis of a gene product , either RNA or protein . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic trait . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene-environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or the number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence , leading to different variants , known as alleles , in the population . These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein , which cause different phenotypical traits . Usage of the term having a gene ( e.g. , good genes , hair colour gene ) typically refers to containing a different allele of the same , shared gene . Genes evolve due to natural selection / survival of the fittest and genetic drift of the alleles .",
  "/wiki/Locus_(genetics)": "In genetics , a locus ( plural loci ) is a specific , fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic marker is located . Each chromosome carries many genes , with each gene occupying a different position or locus ; in humans , the total number of protein-coding genes in a complete haploid set of 23 chromosomes is estimated at 19,000-20,000 . Genes may possess multiple variants known as alleles , and an allele may also be said to reside at a particular locus . Diploid and polyploid cells whose chromosomes have the same allele at a given locus are called homozygous with respect to that locus , while those that have different alleles at a given locus are called heterozygous . The ordered list of loci known for a particular genome is called a gene map . Gene mapping is the process of determining the specific locus or loci responsible for producing a particular phenotype or biological trait .",

  "/wiki/Autosomal_dominant": "Dominance , in genetics , is the phenomenon of one variant ( allele ) of a gene on a chromosome masking or overriding the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome . The first variant is termed dominant and the second recessive . This state of having two different variants of the same gene on each chromosome is originally caused by a mutation in one of the genes , either new ( de novo ) or inherited . The terms autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive are used to describe gene variants on non-sex chromosomes ( autosomes ) and their associated traits , while those on sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) are termed X-linked dominant , X-linked recessive or Y-linked , and these show a very different inheritance and presentation pattern to autosomal traits which depends on the sex of the individual ( see Sex linkage ) . Additionally , there are other forms of dominance such as incomplete dominance , in which a gene variant has a partial effect compared to when it is present on both chromosomes , and co-dominance , in which different variants on each chromosome both show their associated traits . Dominance is not inherent to an allele or its traits ( phenotype ) . It is a strictly relative effect between two alleles of a given gene of any function ; one allele can be dominant over a second allele of the same gene , recessive to a third and co-dominant with a fourth . Additionally , one allele may be dominant for one trait but not others . Often , the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not . Hence , many autosomal recessive conditions are the result of lack of a functioning protein , for example an enzyme . On the other hand , many autosomal dominant conditions result in the presence of a diseased form of a critical protein or simply not enough expressivity of the critical protein . Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics .",

  "/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm": "The thoracic diaphragm , or simply the diaphragm ( ) , is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle in humans and other mammals that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity . The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity , containing the heart and lungs , from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration : as the diaphragm contracts , the volume of the thoracic cavity increases , creating a negative pressure there , which draws air into the lungs . The term diaphragm in anatomy , created by Gerard of Cremona , can refer to other flat structures such as the urogenital diaphragm or pelvic diaphragm , but the diaphragm generally refers to the thoracic diaphragm . In humans , the diaphragm is slightly asymmetric - its right half is higher up ( superior ) to the left half , since the large liver rests beneath the right half of the diaphragm . There is also a theory that the diaphragm is lower on the other side due to the presence of the heart . Other mammals have diaphragms , and other vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles have diaphragm-like structures , but important details of the anatomy vary , such as the position of the lungs in the abdominal cavity .",

It is common for them to be called spinal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT ) , because the diseases are closely related in symptoms and genetic cause . The diagnostic difference in these diseases is the presence of sensory loss in the extremities . There are seven classifications of dHMNs , each defined by patterns of inheritance , age of onset , severity , and muscle groups involved . Type V ( sometimes notated as Type 5 ) is a disorder characterized by autosomal dominance , weakness of the upper limbs that is progressive and symmetrical , and atrophy of the small muscles of the hands .",
  "/wiki/Hereditary_spastic_paraplegia": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia ( HSP ) is a group of inherited diseases whose main feature is a progressive gait disorder . The disease presents with progressive stiffness ( spasticity ) and contraction in the lower limbs . HSP is also known as hereditary spastic paraparesis , familial spastic paraplegia , French settlement disease , Strumpell disease , or Strumpell-Lorrain disease . The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of long axons in the spinal cord . The affected cells are the primary motor neurons ; therefore , the disease is an upper motor neuron disease . HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia . The origin of HSP is different from cerebral palsy . Despite this , some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to treat HSP symptoms . HSP is caused by defects in transport of proteins , structural proteins , cell maintaining proteins , lipids , and other substances through the cell . Long nerve fibers ( axons ) are affected because long distances make nerve cells particularly sensitive to defects in these mentioned mechanisms . The disease was first mentioned in 1876 by Adolph Seeligm\u00fcller , a German neurologist , who described a family of four affected children with spasticity . Further cases were described in 1883 by Adolph Str\u00fcmpell , a German neurologist .",
