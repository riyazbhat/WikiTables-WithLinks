  "/wiki/Happy_Days": "Happy Days is an American television sitcom that aired first-run from January 15 , 1974 to September 24 , 1984 on ABC , with a total of 255 half-hour episodes spanning eleven seasons . Created by Garry Marshall , the series was one of the most successful of the 1970s , an idealized vision of life in the mid-1950s to mid-1960s Midwestern United States , and starred Ron Howard as young Richie Cunningham , Henry Winkler as his friend Arthur Fonzie Fonzarelli , and Tom Bosley and Marion Ross as Richie 's parents , Howard and Marion Cunningham . Happy Days became one of the biggest successes in television history and heavily influenced the television style of its time . The series began as an unsold pilot starring Howard , Ross and Anson Williams , which aired in 1972 as a segment entitled Love and the Television Set ( later retitled Love and the Happy Days for syndication ) on ABC 's anthology show Love , American Style . Based on the pilot , director George Lucas cast Howard as the lead in his 1973 film American Graffiti , causing ABC to take a renewed interest in the pilot . The first two seasons of Happy Days focused on the experiences and dilemmas of innocent teenager Richie Cunningham , his family , and his high school friends , attempting to honestly depict a wistful look back at adolescence . Initially a moderate success , the series ' ratings began to fall during its second season , causing Marshall to retool it emphasizing broad comedy and spotlighting the previously minor character of Fonzie , a cool biker and high school dropout . Following these changes , Happy Days became the number-one program in television in 1976-1977 , Fonzie became one of the most merchandised characters of the 1970s , and Henry Winkler became a major star . The series also spawned a number of spin-offs , including Laverne & Shirley and Mork & Mindy .",

Due to the Urkel character 's off-putting characteristics and the way he is written to stir up events and underscore the plot or even move it along , he is considered a nuisance by the original protagonist 's family , the Winslows , though they come to accept him over time . The character is the epitome of a geek or nerd of the era , due to traits such as large , thick eyeglasses , flood pants held up by suspenders , multi-colored cardigan sweaters , saddle shoes , and a high-pitched voice . He professes love for his neighbor Laura Winslow , who is a character in the main family of the series , but this love of his is written as an accent on or trigger for events and crises , and is therefore very unrequited .

All his prominent blood relations - son Bart , daughters Lisa and Maggie , his father , his mother and half-brother - have also been heard to use it themselves in similar circumstances . On a few occasions Homer 's wife Marge and even non-related characters such as Mr. Burns and Sideshow Bob have also used this phrase . In 2006 , d'oh ! was listed as number six on TV Land 's list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases . The spoken word d'oh is a sound trademark of 20th Century Fox . Since 2001 , the word doh has appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary , without the apostrophe . Early recorded usages of the sound d'oh are in numerous episodes of the BBC Radio series It 's That Man Again between 1945 and 1949 , but the OxfordWords blog notes Homer was responsible for popularizing it as an exclamation of frustration . The term also appeared in an early issue of Mad comics , with a different spelling but the same meaning , in issue 8 ( December 1953 - January 1954 ) ; in a one-page story by Harvey Kurtzman entitled Hey Look ! , a man seeking peace and quiet suddenly hears a loud radio and , grimacing , says , D-oooh - the neighbors [ sic ] radio ! !",
