It also claims to be the oldest appellate court in the United States , a claim that is disputed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court . The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania began in 1684 as the Provincial Court , and casual references to it as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania were made official in 1722 upon its reorganization as an entity separate from the control of the royal governor . Today , the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania maintains a discretionary docket , meaning that the Court may choose which cases it accepts , with the exception of mandatory death penalty appeals , and certain appeals from the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court . This discretion allows the Court to wield powerful influence on the formation and interpretation of Pennsylvania law .",

  "/wiki/Texas_Supreme_Court": "The Supreme Court of Texas ( SCOTX ) is the court of last resort for civil appeals ( including juvenile delinquency cases , which are categorized as civil under the Texas Family Code ) in the U.S. state of Texas . A different court , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ( CCA ) is the court of last resort in criminal cases . The Court has its seat at the Supreme Court Building on the State Capitol grounds in Austin , Texas . Like the U.S. Supreme Court , the Texas Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and eight associate justices . Unlike the SCOTUS , however , all nine positions are elected , with a term of office of six years with no term limit , rather than life tenure . All members typically belong to the same party because all are elected in statewide races , rather than by the electorates of smaller appellate districts , as the justices on the intermediate appellate courts are . Although there are fourteen such courts , the state is geographically divided into thirteen . Two districts ( the 1st and the 14th ) are coextensive . The First and Fourteenth Courts of Appeals serve the same ten counties , sit in the same Downtown Houston Courthouse , and also share a single clerk . The Texas Supreme Court was established in 1846 to replace the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas . It meets in Downtown Austin , Texas in an office building near the Texas State Capitol .",

Other major cities include Austin , the second-most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term six flags over Texas [ note 1 ] refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory .",
