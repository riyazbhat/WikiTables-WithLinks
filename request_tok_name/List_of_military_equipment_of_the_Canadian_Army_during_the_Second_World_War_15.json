  "/wiki/Dodge_WC_series": "The Dodge WC series was a prolific range of light 4WD and medium 6WD military utility trucks , produced by Dodge / Fargo during World War II . [ nb 3 ] Together with the \u200b1\u20444-ton jeeps produced by Willys and Ford , the Dodge \u200b1\u20442-tons and \u200b3\u20444-tons made up nearly all of the light 4WD trucks supplied to the U.S. military in WWII - with Dodge contributing some 337,500 4WD units [ nb 4 ] ( about half as many as the jeep [ nb 5 ] ) . Contrary to the versatility of the highly standardized jeep , which was mostly achieved through field modification , the Dodge WC - series came in many different , purpose-built , but mechanically uniform variants from the factory , much akin to the later family of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles . The WC series evolved out of , and was part of a more extended family of trucks , with great mechanical parts commonality , that included open- and closed-cab cargo trucks and weapons carriers , ( radio ) command cars , reconnaissance vehicles , ambulances , carryalls , panel vans , and telephone installation and mobile emergency / field workshop trucks . From 1940 to 1942 , almost 82,400 G-505 \u200b1\u20442-ton 4x4 Dodge trucks were built - initially called the VC series , but the great majority ( from 1941 ) in the WC series , and in more variants . However in 1942 , the truck grew into the G-502 \u200b3\u20444-ton 4x4 Truck ( Dodge ) and the G-507 1\u200b1\u20442-ton 6x6 personnel and cargo truck ( Dodge ) - retaining the Dodge WC model code . Although the \u200b3\u20444-tons featured significant design improvements , they retained some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the \u200b1\u20442-ton models . Dodge was the U.S. Army 's main supplier of \u200b1\u20442-ton trucks , and its sole supplier of both \u200b3\u20444-ton trucks and 1\u200b1\u20442-ton six-by-six trucks in World War II . With over a quarter million units built through August 1945 , the G502 \u200b3\u20444-tons were the most common variants in the WC - series . After the war , Dodge developed the \u200b3\u20444-ton WC - series into the civilian 4x4 Power Wagons ; and in 1951 , the WCs were replaced by the very similar \u200b3\u20444-ton 4x4 Dodge M-series vehicles . WC was not an abbreviation of Weapons Carrier , but a Dodge model code - initially W for 1941 , and C for half-ton rating . However , the 'WC ' model code was retained for both the \u200b3\u20444-ton and 1\u200b1\u20442-ton 6x6 Dodges - as well as for the subsequent model years .",
  "/wiki/Dodge": "Dodge is an American brand of automobile manufactured by FCA US LLC ( formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Group LLC ) , based in Auburn Hills , Michigan . Dodge vehicles currently include performance cars , though for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler 's mid-priced brand above Plymouth . Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s , Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies for Detroit-based automakers and began building complete automobiles under the Dodge Brothers brand in 1914 , predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation . The factory was located in Hamtramck , Michigan , and was called the Dodge Main factory from 1910 until its closing in January 1980 . Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920 , and the company was sold by their families to Dillon , Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928 . Dodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s , though it made compact cars ( such as the 1963-76 Dart ) and midsize cars ( such as the B-Body Coronet and Charger from 1966-78 ) . The 1973 oil crisis and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the K platform of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year . The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler 's business in the 1980s ; one such derivative became the Dodge Caravan . The Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009 , including its short-lived merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007 , its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management , its 2009 bailout by the United States government , and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat . In 2011 , Dodge and its model sub-brands , Dodge Ram , and Dodge Viper were separated . Dodge said that the Viper would be an SRT product and Ram will be a standalone marque . In 2014 , SRT was merged back into Dodge .",

The jeep became the primary light wheeled transport vehicle of the United States Military and its Allies in World War II , as well as the postwar period , with President Eisenhower once calling it , one of three decisive weapons the U.S. had during WWII . It was also the world 's first mass-produced four-wheel drive car , manufactured in six-figure numbers . About 650,000 units were built , constituting a quarter of the total U.S. non-combat motor vehicles produced during the war , and almost two-thirds of the 988,000 light vehicle class produced , together with the Dodge WC series . Large numbers of jeeps were provided to the U.S. ' allies , including Russia at the time - aside from large amounts of 1\u200b1\u20442- and 2\u200b1\u20442-ton trucks , some 50,000 jeeps and 25,000 \u200b3\u20444-tons were provided to Russia during WW II - more than Nazi Germany 's combined total production of their Volkswagen vehicles , the K\u00fcbelwagen and the Schwimmwagen . Author Charles K. Hyde wrote : In many respects , the jeep became the iconic vehicle of World War II , with an almost mythological reputation of toughness , durability , and versatility . Not only did it become the workhorse of the American military , as it replaced the use of horses and other draft animals ( still heavily used in World War I ) in every role , from cavalry units to supply trains , but improvised field modifications also made the jeep capable of just about any other function GIs could think of . The jeep was considered such a valuable piece of equipment that General Eisenhower wrote that most senior officers regarded it as one of the six most vital U.S. vehicles to win the war . [ nb 4 ] [ failed verification ] Moreover , General George Marshall called the squared-off little car America 's greatest contribution to modern warfare . In 1991 , the MB Jeep was designated an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers . After WWII , the original jeep continued to serve , in the Korean War and other conflicts , until it was updated in the form of the M38 Willys MC and M38A1 Willys MD ( in 1949 and 1952 respectively ) , and received a complete redesign by Ford in the form of the 1960-introduced M151 jeep . Its influence , however , was much greater than that - manufacturers around the world began building jeeps and similar designs , either under license or not - at first primarily for military purposes , but later also for the civilian market .",

  "/wiki/Canadian_Military_Pattern_truck": "Canadian Military Pattern ( CMP ) trucks were a class and a coherent range of military trucks , made in large numbers , and in numerous variants , by Canada during World War II , compliant to British Army specifications , primarily intended for use in the armies of the British Commonwealth allies , but also serving in other units of the British Empire . Until the currency restrictions of the late 1940s , the Canadian automotive industry 's output provided a major part of British Empire countries vehicles . These territories levied reduced , Imperial preference , duties on Canadian products , usually made by Canadian subsidiaries of the big U.S. auto manufacturers . In the late 1930s , Canada started drawing up standard designs , to prepare for the beginning of the war , which involved a unique and historic design and production collaboration between rival giant car-makers Ford and GM of Canada . Canadian Military Pattern trucks not only motorized the militaries of Britain , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , but were also sent to the Soviet Union following the Nazi invasion , as part of Canada 's Gift and Mutual Aid program to the Allies . During the War , CMP trucks saw service around the world in the North African Campaign , the Allied invasion of Sicily , the Italian Campaign , the Soviet Front , the Burma Campaign , the Battle of the Philippines ( 1941-42 ) , the liberation of Northwest Europe , and the Western Allied invasion of Germany . CMP trucks also served in post-war conflicts in Indonesia , French Indochina , and the Portuguese colonies in Africa . The United Kingdom 's official History of the Second World War called Canada 's war-time production of soft-skinned trucks , including the CMP class , the country 's most important contribution to Allied victory . Canada 's trucks are considered to have .put the British Army on wheels - in the North African Campaign , the British Eighth Army fought Rommel using almost exclusively CMP trucks ; and the Allied progress from Sicily , through Italy and France , depended heavily on the Canadian trucks . By war 's end , Canada 's vast supply of trucks provided a vehicle for every three soldiers in the field - compared to one vehicle per seven American GIs , making it the most mobile army in the world .",

Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3 , 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company . Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2 , 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency . After Durant 's second ousting in 1919 , Alfred Sloan , with his maxim a car for every purse and purpose , would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family , selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford 's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 . Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide . In Oceania , Chevrolet is represented by Holden Special Vehicles , having returned to the region in 2018 after a 50-year absence with the launching of the Camaro and Silverado pickup truck ( HSV was partially and formerly owned by GM subsidiary Holden , which GM is retiring in 2020 ) . In 2005 , Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe , primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet , a move rooted in General Motors ' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet . With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe , GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand , while GM 's traditional European standard-bearers , Opel of Germany , and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket . However , GM reversed this move in late 2013 , announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe , with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette in 2016 . Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states , including Russia . After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea , the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet .
