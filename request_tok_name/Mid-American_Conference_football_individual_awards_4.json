The Hurricanes ' 31-30 win over Nebraska is still talked about as one of the greatest games of all time , not only for its last minute finish , but for its role in changing the face of college football . Miami came into the game ranked # 5 , but losses by # 2 Texas in the Cotton Bowl and # 4 Illinois in the Rose Bowl launched them to # 1 ( despite protests from # 3 Auburn , who played the toughest schedule in the nation that year ) . Nebraska scored a touchdown with 48 seconds remaining , putting them within one point of the Hurricanes . Despite knowing a tie would still give Nebraska the national title , Coach Tom Osborne decided to go for two points and the win rather than one point and the tie . Miami was able to hold , snapping Nebraska 's 22-game winning streak and launching Miami as a powerhouse program . This Miami team was the first to win a national title without a single player voted to the first team All-Americans and only the second to win a national title gaining more passing yards than rushing . The Auburn Tigers , featuring Bo Jackson also had a stellar season going 11-1 and beating Michigan in the Sugar Bowl 9-7 . Despite entering the bowl games ranked third in both major polls , and with both teams ranked higher losing their bowl games , the Tigers ended ranked third in the final AP poll as Miami jumped from 5th to ranked # 1 when they beat # 1 ranked Nebraska to gain the National Championship . Auburn had played the toughest schedule in the nation , including eight bowl teams , seven of which were ranked in the top 20 ( four in the top ten ) .

Despite this the Cougars were voted # 1 in the final AP and UPI polls .

Further controversy surrounded the inclusion of one-loss Florida State in the national title game over undefeated West Virginia , who was ranked # 2 ( ahead of Florida State ) by the final regular season coaches ' poll but not the AP ( Nebraska was # 2 in the AP ) .

Nebraska , who finished the season undefeated , ended the year ranked No . 1 in both the Associated Press and Coaches polls . This was the first national championship of coach Tom Osborne 's career at Nebraska , despite coming close in two prior attempts ; in 1983 , his team lost to Miami after Osborne , with his team trailing 31-30 late in the game , elected to try for the lead instead of the tie and failed . In the previous season , Osborne 's team lost to eventual national champion Florida State on a missed field goal as time expired . Although Osborne 's team finished the season unbeaten , the national championship picture again was engulfed in controversy . For much of the second half of the season , Nebraska and Penn State were regarded as the top two teams in the country . This raised the possibility of a split national championship for the third time since 1990 , due in large part to the system in place that had been concocted to avoid a split title . Following the 1991 season , where Miami and Washington split the national championship in the AP and Coaches ' polls , the Bowl Coalition was founded . The Coalition consisted of six bowls , with the Orange , Fiesta , Cotton , and Sugar bowls were all considered potential hosts for a national championship game . Since three of these bowls already had specific tie-ins with conferences , an agreement was struck where the conferences would agree to release those teams from their contractual obligations in order to achieve a # 1 vs # 2 matchup .

This was a dominant Nebraska team , averaging 52 points per game and a 39-point average margin of victory , including a 62-24 victory over Florida . This lopsided victory came after Florida was picked by many sportswriters to win the game . Ohio State almost created a national title controversy , going into its final regular season game against Michigan undefeated and ranked # 2 .

Were it not for Texas beating Nebraska , then # 3 , in the first ever Big 12 Championship Game , Florida would n't have even been in the bowl game . And even once they were there , it was n't certain a victory would mean a national championship . The Rose Bowl game featured # 2 Arizona State and # 4 Ohio State . Florida St. and Arizona St. were the only unbeatens going into bowl season , so a Rose Bowl victory would give the Sun Devils a legitimate chance on winning the title . This scenario looked plausible as Arizona State 's Jake Plummer scored with 1:40 left to play in the game , making the score 17-14 . But Ohio State 's backup quarterback Joe Germaine marched down the field to pull out a heart stopping 20-17 win . On the one hand , this meant the national title game the following night would produce an incontrovertible champion .

The Nebraska Cornhuskers garnered the top ranking in the Coaches ' Poll with a 13-0 record , a Big 12 Conference championship , and a win over Tennessee in the Orange Bowl . Michigan 's Charles Woodson , who played primarily at cornerback , but also saw time on offense as a wide receiver and on special teams as a punt returner , won the Heisman Trophy , becoming the first primarily defensive player to win the award . The 1997 season was the third and final season in which the major bowl games were organized under the Bowl Alliance system . The Bowl Championship Series was instituted the following year . In Tom Osborne 's last season as head coach , Nebraska took over the # 1 ranking in the nation after defeating Texas Tech midway through the season . Three weeks later , despite winning at Missouri in an overtime game against an unranked Missouri football team , Nebraska slipped to a # 2 ranking in the polls , as voters were n't impressed by the way the Cornhuskers won the game ( a controversial kicked ball that was caught for the game-tying TD as time expired in regulation ) ; Michigan moved ahead of Nebraska after its 34-8 victory over # 3 ranked Penn State . The consensus # 1 team going into the bowl season was undefeated Michigan , ranked # 1 in both the AP and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll . Led by coach of the year Lloyd Carr and Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson , Michigan went into the 1998 Rose Bowl against # 8 Washington State . Michigan defeated Washington State 21-16 .",

It was the first season of the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) , which saw the Tennessee Volunteers win the national championship , one year after star quarterback Peyton Manning left for the National Football League ( NFL ) . Tennessee defeated the Florida State Seminoles , 23-16 , in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Arizona , to secure the inaugural BCS National Championship . The BCS combined elements of the old Bowl Coalition and the Bowl Alliance it replaced . The agreement existed between the Rose , Fiesta , Sugar , and Orange bowl games , with the Cotton Bowl Classic diminishing in status since the breakup of the Southwest Conference . Like the Bowl Alliance , a national championship game would rotate between the four bowls , with the top two teams facing each other . These teams were chosen based upon a BCS poll , combining the AP Poll , the Coaches Poll , and a computer component . The computer factored in things such as strength of schedule , margin of victory , and quality wins without taking into account time ( in other words , a loss early in the season and a loss late in the season were on equal footing ) . Like the Bowl Coalition , the BCS bowls not hosting the national championship game would retain their traditional conference tie-ins . The first run of the Bowl Championship Series was not without controversy as Kansas State finished third in the final BCS standings , but was not invited to a BCS bowl game . Ohio State ( ranked 4th ) and two-loss Florida ( 8th ) received the at-large bids instead . Also , Tulane went undefeated , but finished 10th in the BCS standings and was not invited to a BCS bowl because of their low strength of schedule .",

A lot of teams faced debacles . East Carolina faced Hurricane Floyd , and in that same week , faced the # 9 Miami Hurricanes . The Pirates were down , 23-3 , but scored 24 unanswered points to win the football game , 27-23 .
