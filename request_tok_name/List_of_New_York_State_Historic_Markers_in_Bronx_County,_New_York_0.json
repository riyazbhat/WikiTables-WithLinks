  "/wiki/Bronx_River": "The Bronx River ( /br\u0252\u014bks/ ) , approximately 24 miles ( 39 km ) long , flows through southeast New York in the United States and drains an area of 38.4 square miles ( 99 km2 ) . It is named after colonial settler Jonas Bronck . The Bronx River is the only fresh water river in New York City . It originally rose in what is now the Kensico Reservoir , in Westchester County north of New York City . With the construction of the Kensico Dam in 1885 , however , the river was cut off from its natural headwaters and today a small tributary stream serves as its source . The Bronx River flows south past White Plains , then south-southwest through the northern suburbs in New York , passing through Edgemont , Tuckahoe , Eastchester , and Bronxville . It forms the border between the large cities of Yonkers and Mount Vernon , and flows into the northern end of The Bronx , where it divides East Bronx from West Bronx , southward through Bronx Park , New York Botanical Garden , and the Bronx Zoo and continues through neighborhoods of the South Bronx . It empties into the East River , a tidal strait connected to Long Island Sound , between the Soundview and Hunts Point neighborhoods . In the 17th century , the river - called by the natives Aquehung - served as a boundary between loosely associated bands under sachems of the informal confederacy of the Wecquaesgeek , Europeanized as the Wappinger ; the east bank of the river was the boundary for the Siwanoy , clammers and fishermen . The same line would be retained when manors were granted to the Dutch and the English . The Algonkian significance of the name is variously reported ; the acca- element , as represented in the Long Island place-name Accabonac , was deformed into the more familiar , suitably watery European morpheme aque- . The tract purchased by Jonas Bronck in 1639 lay between the Harlem River and the river that came to be called Bronck 's river .",

  "/wiki/British_Fleet": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

Her strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the Boston area and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological schism that threatened to destroy the Puritans ' religious community in New England . She was eventually tried and convicted , then banished from the colony with many of her supporters . Hutchinson was born in Alford , Lincolnshire , England , the daughter of Francis Marbury , an Anglican cleric and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most other girls received . She lived in London as a young adult , and there married a friend from home , William Hutchinson . The couple moved back to Alford where they began following preacher John Cotton in the nearby port of Boston , Lincolnshire . Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633 , and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 children and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in New England . Hutchinson was a midwife and helpful to those needing her assistance , as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings . Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly , providing commentary on recent sermons . These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well , including the young governor of the colony , Henry Vane . Hutchinson began to accuse the local ministers ( except for Cotton and her husband 's brother-in-law , John Wheelwright ) of preaching a covenant of works rather than a covenant of grace , and many ministers began to complain about her increasingly blatant accusations , as well as certain unorthodox theological teachings . The situation eventually erupted into what is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy , culminating in her 1637 trial , conviction , and banishment from the colony .",
  "/wiki/Indian_massacre_of_1622": "Powhatan attack of 1622 popularly known as the Jamestown massacre took place in the English Colony of Virginia , in what is now the United States , on Friday , 22 March 1622 . John Smith , though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not an eyewitness , related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan came unarmed into our houses with deer , turkeys , fish , fruits , and other provisions to sell us . The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all the English settlers they found , including men , women , and children of all ages . Chief Opechancanough led the Powhatan Confederacy in a coordinated series of surprise attacks ; they killed 347 people , a quarter of the population of the Virginia colony . Jamestown , founded in 1607 , was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America , and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia . Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands , which ultimately provoked a violent reaction .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence": "The United States Declaration of Independence is the pronouncement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House ( now known as Independence Hall ) in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on July 4 , 1776 . The Declaration explained why the Thirteen Colonies at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states , no longer under British rule . With the Declaration , these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America . The declaration was signed by representatives from New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia . The Lee Resolution for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes . The Committee of Five had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence . John Adams , a leader in pushing for independence , had persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document , which Congress edited to produce the final version . The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . Adams wrote to his wife Abigail , The Second Day of July 1776 , will be the most memorable Epocha , in the History of America - although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4 , the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved . After ratifying the text on July 4 , Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms . It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public . The source copy used for this printing has been lost and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson 's hand .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Constitution": "The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America . The Constitution , originally comprising seven articles , delineates the national frame of government . Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers , whereby the federal government is divided into three branches : the legislative , consisting of the bicameral Congress ( Article One ) ; the executive , consisting of the president ( Article Two ) ; and the judicial , consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts ( Article Three ) . Articles Four , Five and Six embody concepts of federalism , describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments , the states in relationship to the federal government , and the shared process of constitutional amendment . Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it . It is regarded as the oldest written and codified national constitution in force . Since the Constitution came into force in 1789 , it has been amended 27 times , including one amendment that repealed a previous one , in order to meet the needs of a nation that has profoundly changed since the eighteenth century . In general , the first ten amendments , known collectively as the Bill of Rights , offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government . The majority of the seventeen later amendments expand individual civil rights protections . Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures . Amendments to the United States Constitution , unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide , are appended to the document . All four pages of the original U.S. Constitution are written on parchment .",
