He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985 , 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it . Mollberg 's movie 's plot was same as Laine 's movie . But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera . Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties . He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song ( 1973 ) , his debut feature , an earthy , erotically-charged , blood-soaked tale of a young village girl 's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman . Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka , one of Finland 's most controversial young writers , the film stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple , terrible power and its authentic sensuality ( Peter Cowie ) , and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema 's history . It also introduced Mollberg 's trademark style : a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery , stripping them bare of life 's illusions and the polished veneer of culture ( Sakari Toiviainen ) . Despite Peter Cowie 's efforts , and the acclaim of many other critics and independent festivals , The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece , only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing , and lacking English subtitles . During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland . His film The Earth is a Sinful Song ( 1973 ) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film .",

Classical music is used as background throughout much of the film , including excerpts from the work of the famous Swedish tenor Jussi Bj\u00f6rling . It has been argued that the film deals with the ways in which [ c ] apitalism has painted the town red , just a different shade of red from its socialist connotations , as well as that rock is so important to the director that a number of his males , including Koistinen , favor a 50s , greasy , sweptback hair style , to go along with their love of rock ' n ' roll ( definitely a reminder of how rock was the way to rebel in socialist countries ) ."
