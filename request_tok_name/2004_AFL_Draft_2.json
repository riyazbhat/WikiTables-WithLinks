  "/wiki/Trent_Knobel": "Trent Knobel ( born 23 May 1980 ) is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League . Knobel , a ruckman originally from the Gold Coast , was recruited to the AFL in his home state with the Brisbane Lions onto their rookie list . He made his debut in 2000 after a rookie elevation . After getting his chance in Round 14 , Knobel held his spot for much of the season , and played in two finals matches . After a disappointing 2001 season , and with the Lions having an abundance of ruck stocks ( Keating , McLaren , McDonald , Macdonald among others ) , they traded him to St Kilda . After fairly limited seasons with the Saints in 2002 and 2003 , his 2004 season was much improved , playing all 24 games and becoming the Saints ' number one ruckman . Despite his crash and bash ruckwork and tally of 460 hitouts for the year , he was criticised for his lack of around the ground work , averaging just 6 disposals in 2004 . This led to him being traded in the 2005 pre-season draft to the Richmond Football Club . In 2005 , he missed 3 games late in the year with a hamstring injury but performed better around the ground . In 2006 , Knobel played just 3 games and found it hard for selection due to the form of All-Australian ruckman Troy Simmonds . Due to ongoing injury concerns Knobel was unable to play a senior game in 2007 and announced his retirement from AFL football on 28 August 2007 .",
