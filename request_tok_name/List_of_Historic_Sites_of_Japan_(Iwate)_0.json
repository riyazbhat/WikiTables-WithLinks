  "/wiki/Blast_furnace": "A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals , generally pig iron , but also others such as lead or copper . Blast refers to the combustion air being forced or supplied above atmospheric pressure . In a blast furnace , fuel ( coke ) , ores , and flux ( limestone ) are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace , while a hot blast of air ( sometimes with oxygen enrichment ) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres , so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward . The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom , and waste gases ( flue gas ) exiting from the top of the furnace . The downward flow of the ore along with the flux in contact with an upflow of hot , carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process . In contrast , air furnaces ( such as reverberatory furnaces ) are naturally aspirated , usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue . According to this broad definition , bloomeries for iron , blowing houses for tin , and smelt mills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces . However , the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron , an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and steel , and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting .",
