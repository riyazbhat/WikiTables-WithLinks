  "/wiki/E701": "Tetracyclines are a group of broad-spectrum antibiotic compounds that have a common basic structure and are either isolated directly from several species of Streptomyces bacteria or produced semi-synthetically from those isolated compounds . Tetracycline molecules comprise a linear fused tetracyclic nucleus ( rings designated A , B , C and D ) to which a variety of functional groups are attached . Tetracyclines are named for their four ( tetra- ) hydrocarbon rings ( -cycl- ) derivation ( -ine ) . They are defined as a subclass of polyketides , having an octahydrotetracene-2-carboxamide skeleton and are known as derivatives of polycyclic naphthacene carboxamide . While all tetracyclines have a common structure , they differ from each other by the presence of chloride , methyl , and hydroxyl groups . These modifications do not change their broad antibacterial activity , but do affect pharmacological properties such as half-life and binding to proteins in serum . Tetracyclines were discovered in the 1940s and exhibited activity against a wide range of microorganisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria , chlamydiae , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae , and protozoan parasites . Tetracycline itself was discovered later than chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline but is still considered as the parent compound for nomenclature purposes . Tetracyclines are among the cheapest classes of antibiotics available and have been used extensively in prophylaxis and in treatment of human and animal infections , as well as at subtherapeutic levels in animal feed as growth promoters . Tetracyclines are growth inhibitors ( bacteriostatic ) rather than killers of the infectious agent ( bacteriocidal ) and are only effective against multiplying microorganisms . They are short-acting and passively diffuse through porin channels in the bacterial membrane . They inhibit protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and preventing the aminoacyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome .",

  "/wiki/E703": "Oxytetracycline was the second of the broad-spectrum tetracycline group of antibiotics to be discovered . Oxytetracycline works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to produce essential proteins . Without these proteins , the bacteria can not grow , multiply and increase in numbers . Oxytetracycline therefore stops the spread of the infection and the remaining bacteria are killed by the immune system or eventually die . Oxytetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic , active against a wide variety of bacteria . However , some strains of bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic , which has reduced its effectiveness for treating some types of infections . Oxytetracycline is still used to treat infections caused by Chlamydia ( e.g. , the chest infection psittacosis , the eye infection trachoma , and the genital infection urethritis ) and infections caused by Mycoplasma organisms ( e.g. , pneumonia ) . Oxytetracycline is also used to treat acne , due to its activity against the bacteria on the skin that influence the development of acne ( Cutibacterium acnes ) . It is used to treat flare-ups of chronic bronchitis , due to its activity against the bacteria usually responsible , Haemophilus influenzae . Oxytetracycline may also be used to treat other rarer infections , such as those caused by a group of micro-organisms called rickettsiae ( e.g. , Rocky Mountain spotted fever ) . To make sure the bacteria causing an infection are susceptible to it , a tissue sample is usually taken , for example a swab from the infected area , or a urine or blood sample .
