The work covers the world as it was then known to the Chinese and a 2500-year period from the age of the legendary Yellow Emperor to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in the author 's own time . The Records has been called a foundational text in Chinese civilization . After Confucius and the First Emperor of Qin , Sima Qian was one of the creators of Imperial China , not least because by providing definitive biographies , he virtually created the two earlier figures . The Records set the model for the 24 subsequent dynastic histories of China . In contrast to Western historical works , the Records do not treat history as a continuous , sweeping narrative , but rather break it up into smaller , overlapping units dealing with famous leaders , individuals , and major topics of significance .",
  "/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Han": "Emperor Wen of Han ( 200 BC - 6 July 157 BC ) was the fifth emperor of the Han dynasty of ancient China . His personal name was Liu Heng . Liu Heng was a son of Emperor Gao of Han and Consort Bo , later empress dowager . When Emperor Gao suppressed the rebellion of Dai , he made Liu Heng Prince of Dai . After Empress Dowager L\u00fc 's death , the officials eliminated the powerful L\u00fc clan , and deliberately chose the Prince of Dai as the emperor , since his mother , Consort Bo , had no powerful relatives , and her family was known for its humility and thoughtfulness . His reign brought a much needed political stability that laid the groundwork for prosperity under his grandson Emperor Wu . According to historians , Emperor Wen trusted and consulted with ministers on state affairs ; under the influence of his Taoist wife , Empress Dou , the emperor also sought to avoid wasteful expenditures . Historians noted that the tax rates were at a ratio of 1 out of 30 and 1 out of 60 , corresponding to 3.33% and 1.67% , respectively . ( These rates are not for income taxes , but property taxes , as the only ancient Chinese attempt to levy an income tax would come in the time of Wang Mang . ) Warehouses were so full of grain that some of it was left to decay . Emperor Wen was said by Liu Xiang to have devoted much time to legal cases , and to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai , using Xing-Ming , a form of personnel examination , to control his subordinates . In a move of lasting importance in 165 BC , Wen introduced recruitment to the civil service through examination .",

  "/wiki/Xia_Dynasty": "The Xia dynasty is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese historiography . According to tradition , the Xia dynasty was established by the legendary Yu the Great after Shun , the last of the Five Emperors , gave the throne to him . The Xia was later succeeded by the Shang dynasty . There are no contemporaneous records of the Xia , and they are not mentioned in the oldest Chinese texts , since the earliest oracle bone inscriptions date from the late Shang period ( 13th century BC ) . The earliest mentions occur in the oldest chapters of the Book of Documents , which report speeches from the early Western Zhou period , and are accepted by most scholars as dating from that time . These speeches justify the Zhou conquest of the Shang as the passing of the Mandate of Heaven , likening it to the succession of the Xia by the Shang . This political philosophy was promoted by the Confucian school in the Eastern Zhou period . The succession of dynasties was incorporated into the Bamboo Annals and the Records of the Grand Historian , and became the official position of imperial historiography and ideology . Some scholars consider the Xia dynasty mythical , or at least unsubstantiated , while others identify it with the archaeological Erlitou culture . According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by Liu Xin , the Xia ruled between 2205 and 1766 BC ; according to the chronology based upon the Bamboo Annals , it ruled between 1989 and 1558 BC . The Xia-Shang-Zhou Chronology Project , commissioned by the Chinese government in 1996 , concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC .",

Named for its heartland in Qin state ( modern Gansu and Shaanxi ) , the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang , the First Emperor of Qin . The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC , during the Warring States period . In the mid and late third century BC , the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests , first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty , and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States . Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history , consisting of only two emperors , but inaugurated an imperial system that lasted from 221 BC , with interruption and adaptation , until 1912 AD . The Qin sought to create a state unified by structured centralized political power and a large military supported by a stable economy . The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry , who comprised the overwhelming majority of the population and labour force . This allowed ambitious projects involving three hundred thousand peasants and convicts , such as connecting walls along the northern border , eventually developing into the Great Wall of China . The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency , weights , measures , and a uniform system of writing , which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce . Additionally , its military used the most recent weaponry , transportation , and tactics , though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic . Han Confucians portrayed the legalistic Qin dynasty as a monolithic tyranny , notably citing a purge known as the burning of books and burying of scholars although some modern scholars dispute the veracity of these accounts . When the first emperor died in 210 BC , two of his advisers placed an heir on the throne in an attempt to influence and control the administration of the dynasty .",

  "/wiki/Tang_Dynasty": "The Tang dynasty ( /t\u0251\u02d0\u014b/ ; Chinese : \u5510\u671d [ a ] ) or the Tang Empire was an imperial dynasty of China that ruled from 618 to 907 , with an interregnum between 690 and 705 . It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history . Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization , and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture . Tang territory , acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers , rivaled that of the Han dynasty . The Tang capital at Chang'an ( present-day Xi'an ) was the most populous city in the world in its day . The L\u01d0 family ( \u674e ) founded the dynasty , seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire . The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne , proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant . In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries , the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people . Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people . [ b ] With its large population base , the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road . Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court , while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system . Besides political hegemony , the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian states such as those in Japan and Korea .",

The Three Kingdoms period is defined as being from 57 BC to 668 AD ( but there existed about 78 tribal states in the southern region of the Korean peninsula and relatively big states like Okjeo , Buyeo , and Dongye in its northern part and Manchuria ) . The three kingdoms occupied the entire Korean Peninsula and roughly half of Manchuria , located in present-day China and Russia . The kingdoms of Baekje and Silla dominated the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and Tamna ( Jeju Island ) , whereas Goguryeo controlled the Liaodong Peninsula , Manchuria and the northern half of the Korean Peninsula . Baekje and Goguryeo shared founding myths which likely originated from Buyeo . In the 7th century , allied with China under the Tang dynasty , Silla unified the Korean Peninsula for the first time in Korean history , forming a united Korean national identity for the first time . After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo , the Tang dynasty established a short-lived military government to administer parts of the Korean peninsula .

It is a selection of what were judged to be the best poetic and prose pieces from the late Warring States period ( c. 300 BC ) to the early Liang dynasty ( c. AD 500 ) , excluding the Chinese Classics and philosophical texts . The Wen Xuan preserves most of the greatest fu rhapsody and shi poetry pieces from the Qin and Han dynasties , and for much of pre-modern history was one of the primary sources of literary knowledge for educated Chinese . The Wen Xuan was compiled between AD 520 and 530 in the city of Jiankang ( modern Nanjing ) during the Liang dynasty by Xiao Tong , the eldest son of Emperor Wu of Liang , and a group of scholars he had assembled . The Liang dynasty , though short-lived , was a period of intense literary activity , and the ruling Xiao family ensured that eminent writers and scholars were frequently invited to the imperial and provincial courts . As Crown Prince , Xiao Tong received the best classical Chinese education available and began selecting pieces for his new anthology in his early twenties . The Wen Xuan contains 761 separate pieces organized into 37 literary categories , the largest and most well known being Rhapsodies ( fu ) and Lyric Poetry ( shi ) . Study of the Wen Xuan enjoyed immense popularity during the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , and its study rivalled that of the Five Classics during that period . The Wen Xuan was required reading for any aspiring scholar and official even into the Song dynasty , as evidenced by the medieval Chinese rhyme Wen Xuan study thoroughly done / Half your licentiate already won ( W\u00e9nxu\u01cen l\u00e0n , xi\u00f9c\u00e1i b\u00e0n \u6587\u9078\u721b\uff0c\u79c0\u624d\u534a ) . Throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties study of the Wen Xuan lapsed out of popularity , though the great philologists of the Qing dynasty revived its study to some extent . Three volumes of the first full English translation of the Wen Xuan have been published by the American sinologist David R. Knechtges , professor emeritus of Chinese at the University of Washington , who aims to eventually complete the translation in five additional volumes .",
