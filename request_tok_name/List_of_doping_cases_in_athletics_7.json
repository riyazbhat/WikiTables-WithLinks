Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier . It regained its independence in 1956 , and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards , with the fifth largest economy in Africa .",

It is on the list of substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since it is a detectable metabolite of nandrolone , an anabolic-androgenic steroid ( AAS ) . Consumption of androstendione products contaminated with traces of bolandione may also result in testing positive for nandrolone . Traces of 19-norandrosterone may be naturally present in human urine . An experiment conducted on athletes showed that after a prolonged intense effort , the 19-norandrosterone concentration can be increased by a factor varying between 2 and 4 , but another study failed to replicate the result . Concentration also increases in the urine of female athletes during menstruation . The consumption of edible parts of a non-castrated pig , containing 19-nortestosterone , has been shown to result in the excretion of 19-norandrosterone in the following hours , so athletes should prudently avoid meals composed of pig offal in the hours preceding doping tests . Consumption of boar meat , liver , kidneys and heart also increased 19-norandrosterone output .",

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

  "/wiki/Biological_passport": "An athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes , in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time . Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athletes established levels outside permissible limits , rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances . Although the terminology athlete passport is recent , the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping . Maybe the first marker of doping , that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood , but through the induced deviations in biological parameters , is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio ( T/E ) . The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples . A decade later , in 1997 , markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations , such as the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) and the Federation Internationale de Ski , to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time . It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term athlete passport . The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency . Many believe [ who ? ] that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports . While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug , the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being . New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method .",

  "/wiki/Continuous_erythropoietin_receptor_activator": "Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( CERA ) is the generic term for drugs in a new class of third-generation erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) . In the media , these agents are commonly referred to as 'EPO ' , short for erythropoietin . CERAs have an extended half-life and a mechanism of action that promotes increased stimulation of erythropoietin receptors compared with other ESAs . Under the trade name Mircera , Roche Pharmaceuticals received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in January 2008 to market a continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator ( methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta ) for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease , including in those undergoing dialysis . .

[ citation needed ] ) Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta had been approved by the European Commission in August 2007 , and was made available in Europe at the start of 2008 . In terms of its structure , Mircera is similar to the previous synthetic EPO drugs , except that it is connected to a chemical called polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , which makes it last longer in the body . According to Roche , the product has the longest half-life of all FDA-approved erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) : up to 6 times longer than darbepoetin alfa and up to 20 times longer than epoetin . CERAs thus promise both lower dosing - significant owing to the high inherent cost of manufacturing recombinant protein drugs - and less frequent injections for patients . ESAs are administered via subcutaneous injections , often in doctor 's offices for patients who lack the skill or dexterity to inject themselves , so the once- or twice-monthly dosing regimen for CERAs promises fewer costly , inconvenient office visits for patients requiring constant hemoglobin level maintenance for chronic kidney disease . In clinical trials , CERA dosed every 3 to 4 weeks demonstrated efficacy similar to that of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin concentrations within the target hemoglobin range .",

Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes .

Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization .",

It has also been used as a stimulant . Tuaminoheptane has been found to act as a reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of norepinephrine , which may underlie its decongestant and stimulant effects . It is an alkylamine . The chemical structure of the drug differs from that of other norepinephrine releasing agents , such as the phenethylamines , which , in contrast to tuaminoheptane , have an aromatic ring in their structure . Tuaminoheptane is also a skin irritant and can cause contact dermatitis via inhibition of volume-regulated anion channels , which limits its usefulness as a decongestant .

  "/wiki/Insulin": "Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of carbohydrates , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat . Beta cells are sensitive to blood sugar levels so that they secrete insulin into the blood in response to high level of glucose ; and inhibit secretion of insulin when glucose levels are low . Insulin enhances glucose uptake and metabolism in the cells , thereby reducing blood sugar level . Their neighboring alpha cells , by taking their cues from the beta cells , secrete glucagon into the blood in the opposite manner : increased secretion when blood glucose is low , and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high . Glucagon increases blood glucose level by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver . The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to the blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of glucose homeostasis .",
  "/wiki/Human_growth_hormone": "Growth hormone ( GH ) or somatotropin , also known as human growth hormone ( hGH or HGH ) in its human form , is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth , cell reproduction , and cell regeneration in humans and other animals . It is thus important in human development . GH also stimulates production of IGF-1 and increases the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids . It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to the receptors on certain types of cells . GH is a 191-amino acid , single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized , stored and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland . A recombinant form of hGH called somatreopleopin ( INN ) is used as a prescription drug to treat children 's growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency . In the United States , it is only available legally from pharmacies by prescription from a licensed health care provider . In recent years in the United States , some health care providers are prescribing growth hormone in the elderly to increase vitality . While legal , the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial . Many of the functions of hGH remain unknown . In its role as an anabolic agent , HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982 , and has been banned by the IOC and NCAA . Traditional urine analysis does not detect doping with HGH , so the ban was not enforced until the early 2000s , when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed .",

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

It is also used non-medically for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes . It is often taken by mouth . Side effects of metandienone include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire , estrogenic effects like fluid retention and breast enlargement , and liver damage . The drug is an agonist of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , and has strong anabolic effects and moderate androgenic effects . It also has moderate estrogenic effects . Metandienone was originally developed in 1955 by CIBA and marketed in Germany and the United States . As the CIBA product Dianabol , metandienone quickly became the first widely used AAS among professional and amateur athletes , and remains the most common orally active AAS for non-medical use . It is currently a controlled substance in the United States and United Kingdom and remains popular among bodybuilders . Metandienone is readily available without a prescription in certain countries such as Mexico , and is also manufactured in some Asian countries ."
