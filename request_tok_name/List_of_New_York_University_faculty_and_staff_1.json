Pine is an American physicist who has made contributions in the field of soft matter physics , including studies on colloids , polymers , surfactant systems , and granular materials . He is Professor of Physics in the NYU College of Arts and Science and Chair of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering . A professor of physics and founding director of the Center for Soft Matter Research at New York University ( NYU ) , Pine is one of the original developers of diffusing-wave spectroscopy , an optical technique that has proven useful to study colloid systems . Pine also has a longstanding interest in colloidal self-assembly and in the development of a broad range of colloids for these purposes , including colloidal templating , colloidal clusters , lock-and-key colloids , and patchy colloids with valence . He also discovered Random Organization , a nonequilibrium phase transition in which the hydrodynamic reversibility of slow flows breaks down . Pine has published over 150 articles and has received numerous fellowships and honors . In 2000 , his work was recognized with the Society of Rheology Publication of the Year Award . He was a Guggenheim Fellow ( 1999-2000 ) and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( 2018 ) , the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( 2000 ) , and the American Physical Society ( 1997 ) . Prior to working at NYU , Pine was a professor in the Chemical Engineering Department and the Materials Department at the University of California , Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) for 10 years ; he served as chair of the Chemical Engineering Department from 2001 to 2004 . He also worked as a research scientist at Exxon Corporate Research in Annandale , New Jersey , and was on the physics faculty at Haverford College near Philadelphia .
