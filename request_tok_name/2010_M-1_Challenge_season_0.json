  "/wiki/Technical_knockout": "A knockout ( abbreviated to KO or K.O . ) is a fight-ending , winning criterion in several full-contact combat sports , such as boxing , kickboxing , muay thai , mixed martial arts , karate , some forms of taekwondo and other sports involving striking , as well as fighting-based video games . A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting . The term is often associated with a sudden traumatic loss of consciousness caused by a physical blow . Single powerful blows to the head ( particularly the jawline and temple ) can produce a cerebral concussion or a carotid sinus reflex with syncope and cause a sudden , dramatic KO . Body blows , particularly the liver punch , can cause progressive , debilitating pain that can also result in a KO . In boxing and kickboxing , a knockout is usually awarded when one participant falls to the canvas and is unable to rise to their feet within a specified period of time , typically because of exhaustion , pain , disorientation , or unconsciousness . For example , if a boxer is knocked down and is unable to continue the fight within a ten-second count , they are counted as having been knocked out and their opponent is awarded the KO victory . In mixed martial arts ( MMA ) competitions , no time count is given after a knockdown , as the sport allows submission grappling as well as ground and pound . If a fighter loses consciousness ( goes limp ) as a result of legal strikes it is declared a KO . Even if the fighter loses consciousness for a brief moment and wakes up again to continue to fight , the fight is stopped and declared a KO . As many MMA fights can take place on the mat rather than standing , it is possible to score a KO via ground and pound , a common victory for grapplers .",
  "/wiki/Heavyweight_(MMA)": "The heavyweight division in mixed martial arts ( MMA ) generally groups fighters between 206-265 lb ( 93.4-120.2 kg ) . Although many ambiguities exist within the lowerweight classes regarding division naming and weight limits , the Heavyweight division is , for the most part , uniform . The Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) and most other North American MMA organizations such as Bellator MMA , WSOF , and King of the Cage ( KOTC ) abide by this interpretation to their 206-265 lb athletes as heavyweights . Pancrase 's overweight division was 198.4-220.5 lb ( 90.0-100.0 kg ) before being revised to its current 205-264.5 lb ( 93.0-120.0 kg ) . The heavyweight upper weight limit , as defined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and the Association of Boxing Commissions is 265 lb ( 120 kg ) .",
  "/wiki/Submission_(combat_sport)": "A submission is a combat sports term for yielding to the opponent , and hence resulting in an immediate defeat . The submission - then also referred to as a tap out or tapping out - is often performed by visibly tapping the floor or the opponent with the hand or in some cases with the foot , or by saying the word 'tap ' to signal the opponent and/or the referee of the submission . In some combative sports where the fighter has cornermen , the cornerman can also stop the fight by throwing in the towel ( usually by literally throwing a towel into the ring ) , which may count as a submission .",
  "/wiki/Armbar": "An armlock in grappling is a single or double joint lock that hyperextends , hyperflexes or hyperrotates the elbow joint or shoulder joint . An armlock that hyperflexes or hyperrotates the shoulder joint is referred to as a shoulder lock , and an armlock that hyperextends the elbow joint is called an armbar . Depending on the joint flexibility of a person , armlocks that hyperrotate the shoulder joint can also hyperrotate the elbow joint , and vice versa . Obtaining an armlock requires effective use of full-body leverage in order to initiate and secure a lock on the targeted arm , while preventing the opponent from escaping the lock . Therefore , performing an armlock is less problematic on the ground , from positions such as the mount , side control , or guard . Armlocks are more difficult to perform when both combatants are standing up , though the stand-up variants are a focus in certain systems such as Chin Na . Armlocks , considered less dangerous techniques in combat sports allowing joint locks , are the most common joint locks used as submission holds . In training , the method of executing an armlock is generally slow and controlled to give the opponent time to submit prior to any infliction of injury . However , in self-defense applications , or when applied improperly or with excessive force , armlocks can cause muscle , tendon and ligament damage , even dislocation , or bone fractures .",

  "/wiki/Rear_naked_choke": "The rear naked choke ( RNC ) is a chokehold in martial arts applied from an opponent 's back . The word naked in this context suggests that , unlike other strangulation techniques found in Jujutsu/Judo , this hold does not require the use of a keikogi ( gi ) or training uniform . The choke has two variations : in one version , the attacker 's arm encircles the opponent 's neck and then grabs their own biceps on the other arm ( see below for details ) ; in the second version , the attacker clasps their hands together instead after encircling the opponent 's neck .",
  "/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts_rules": "Most rule sets for mixed martial arts competitions have evolved since the early days of vale tudo . As a result of health , legal , and moral concerns , many different rulesets were created , which give different countries and promotions very different tactics and strategies . Similarly , shoot wrestling organizations , such as Shooto , expanded their rulesets to integrate elements of vale tudo into their sport . However , for the most part , fighters accustomed to one rule set can easily acclimate to the others . The most prevalent rule set in the world being used currently is the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts , adopted by all state athletic commissions in the United States that regulate mixed martial arts and is used most notably in the Ultimate Fighting Championship . The Unified Rules are the de facto rules for mixed martial arts in the United States , and have been adopted by other promotions and jurisdictions worldwide . Other notable sets include Shooto 's , which were the first to mandate padded gloves , and Pride rules , after PRIDE Fighting Championships , which were also adopted by UFC .",

  "/wiki/Unanimous_decision": "A unanimous decision ( UD ) is a winning criterion in several full-contact combat sports , such as boxing , kickboxing , Muay Thai , mixed martial arts and other sports involving striking in which all three judges agree on which fighter won the match . In boxing , each of the three judges keep score ( round by round ) of which fighter they feel is winning ( and losing ) . A decision is not required to be unanimous for a boxer to be given a victory . Unanimous decision should n't be confused with a majority decision or split decision .",

The choke involves using the arms to encircle the opponent 's neck in a fashion similar to a guillotine .",
