  "/wiki/Leiden_University": "Leiden University ( commonly abbreviated as LEI ; Dutch : Universiteit Leiden ) is a public research university in Leiden , Netherlands . Founded in 1575 by William , Prince of Orange as a reward to the town of Leiden for its defense against Spanish attacks during the Eighty Years ' War , it is the oldest institution of higher education in the Netherlands . Known for its historic foundations and emphasis on the social sciences , the university came into particular prominence during the Dutch Golden Age , when scholars from around Europe were attracted to the Dutch Republic due to its climate of intellectual tolerance and Leiden 's international reputation . During this time , Leiden became the home to individuals such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes , Rembrandt , Christiaan Huygens , Hugo Grotius , Baruch Spinoza and Baron d'Holbach . The university has seven academic faculties and over fifty subject departments while housing more than 40 national and international research institutes . Its historical primary campus consists of buildings scattered across the college town of Leiden , while a second campus located in The Hague houses a liberal arts college and several of its faculties . It is a member of the Coimbra Group , the Europaeum , and a founding member of the League of European Research Universities . Leiden University has been placed in the top 100 universities in the world by three major ranking tables .

  "/wiki/Mathematics": "Mathematics ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma , knowledge , study , learning ) includes the study of such topics as quantity ( number theory ) , structure ( algebra ) , space ( geometry ) , and change ( mathematical analysis ) . It has no generally accepted definition . Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof . When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena , mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature . Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects . Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist . The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry . Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements . Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano ( 1858-1932 ) , David Hilbert ( 1862-1943 ) , and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions . Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day . Mathematics is essential in many fields , including natural science , engineering , medicine , finance , and the social sciences . Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines , such as statistics and game theory .",
  "/wiki/ABC_conjecture": "The abc conjecture ( also known as the Oesterl\u00e9-Masser conjecture ) is a conjecture in number theory , first proposed by Joseph Oesterl\u00e9 ( 1988 ) and David Masser ( 1985 ) . It is stated in terms of three positive integers , a , b and c ( hence the name ) that are relatively prime and satisfy a + b = c. If d denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of abc , the conjecture essentially states that d is usually not much smaller than c. In other words : if a and b are composed from large powers of primes , then c is usually not divisible by large powers of primes . The precise statement is given below . The abc conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the Szpiro conjecture about elliptic curves . The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the abc conjecture . The abc conjecture and its versions express , in concentrated form , some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry . A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the abc conjecture or its versions . Goldfeld ( 1996 ) described the abc conjecture as the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis . Various attempts to prove the abc conjecture have been made , but none are currently accepted by the mainstream mathematical community and the conjecture is still largely recognized to be unproven as of 2020 .",
  "/wiki/Cryptography": "Cryptography or cryptology ( from Ancient Greek : \u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 , romanized : krypt\u00f3s hidden , secret ; and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd graphein , to write , or -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 -logia , study , respectively ) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries . More generally , cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages ; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality , data integrity , authentication , and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography . Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics , computer science , electrical engineering , communication science , and physics . Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce , chip-based payment cards , digital currencies , computer passwords , and military communications . Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption , the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense . The originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries . The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice ( A ) for the sender , Bob ( B ) for the intended recipient , and Eve ( eavesdropper ) for the adversary . Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II , the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread . Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice ; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions , making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary . It is theoretically possible to break such a system , but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means . These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure ; theoretical advances , e.g. , improvements in integer factorization algorithms , and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted . There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably can not be broken even with unlimited computing power - an example is the one-time pad - but these schemes are more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms .",
  "/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)": "RSA ( Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission . In such a cryptosystem , the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret ( private ) . In RSA , this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers , the factoring problem . The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest , Adi Shamir , and Leonard Adleman , who first publicly described the algorithm in 1977 . Clifford Cocks , an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , had developed an equivalent system in 1973 , but this was not declassified until 1997 . A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers , along with an auxiliary value . The prime numbers must be kept secret . Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message , but only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can decode the message . Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem . Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem remains an open question . There are currently no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used . RSA is a relatively slow algorithm , and because of this , it is less commonly used to directly encrypt user data .",

  "/wiki/Superconductor": "Superconductivity is the set of physical properties observed in certain materials , wherein electrical resistance vanishes and from which magnetic flux fields are expelled . Any material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor . Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor , whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered even down to near absolute zero , a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero . An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source . This phenomenon was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8 , 1911 , in Leiden . Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines , superconductivity is a quantum mechanical mystery . It is characterized by the Meissner effect , the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state . The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity can not be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics . In 1986 , it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 90 K ( \u2212183 \u00b0C ) . Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor , leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors . The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K , and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures .",

Originally defined as the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter , it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics . It is approximately equal to 3.14159 . It has been represented by the Greek letter \u03c0 since the mid-18th century , though it is also sometimes spelled out as pi . It is also called Archimedes ' constant . Being an irrational number , \u03c0 can not be expressed as a common fraction ( equivalently , its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanently repeating pattern ) . Still , fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate \u03c0 . The digits appear to be randomly distributed . In particular , the digit sequence of \u03c0 is conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness , but to date , no proof of this has been discovered . Also , \u03c0 is a transcendental number ; that is , it is not the root of any polynomial having rational coefficients . This transcendence of \u03c0 implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge .

Fischer random chess employs the same board and pieces as standard chess , but the starting position of the pieces on the players ' home ranks is randomized , following certain rules . The random setup makes gaining an advantage through the memorization of openings impracticable ; players instead must rely more on their spontaneous talent and creativity over the board . Randomizing the main pieces had long been known as shuffle chess ; however , Fischer random chess introduces new rules regarding the initial random set up , preserving the dynamic nature of the game by retaining bishops of opposite colours for each player and the right to castle for both sides .

  "/wiki/Genetics": "Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes , genetic variation , and heredity in organisms . Though heredity had been observed for millennia , Gregor Mendel , a scientist and Augustinian friar working in the 19th century , was the first to study genetics scientifically .

DNA and ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) are nucleic acids ; alongside proteins , lipids and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ) , nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life . The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases ( cytosine [ C ] , guanine [ G ] , adenine [ A ] or thymine [ T ] ) , a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next , resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone . The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together , according to base pairing rules ( A with T and C with G ) , with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA . The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups , pyrimidines and purines . In DNA , the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine ; the purines are adenine and guanine . Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information . This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate . A large part of DNA ( more than 98% for humans ) is non-coding , meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences . The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel .",
  "/wiki/Drug_design": "Drug design , often referred to as rational drug design or simply rational design , is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target . The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein , which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient . In the most basic sense , drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it . Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques . This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design . Finally , drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design . In addition to small molecules , biopharmaceuticals including peptides and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity , selectivity , and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed . The phrase drug design is to some extent a misnomer . A more accurate term is ligand design ( i.e. , design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target ) . Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful , there are many other properties , such as bioavailability , metabolic half-life , side effects , etc. , that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug . These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques . Nevertheless , due to high attrition rates , especially during clinical phases of drug development , more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved , marketed drug .",

Compounds used as medicines are most often organic compounds , which are often divided into the broad classes of small organic molecules ( e.g. , atorvastatin , fluticasone , clopidogrel ) and biologics ( infliximab , erythropoietin , insulin glargine ) , the latter of which are most often medicinal preparations of proteins ( natural and recombinant antibodies , hormones , etc. ) . Inorganic and organometallic compounds are also useful as drugs ( e.g. , lithium and platinum-based agents such as lithium carbonate and cisplatin as well as gallium ) . In particular , medicinal chemistry in its most common practice - focusing on small organic molecules - encompasses synthetic organic chemistry and aspects of natural products and computational chemistry in close combination with chemical biology , enzymology and structural biology , together aiming at the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents . Practically speaking , it involves chemical aspects of identification , and then systematic , thorough synthetic alteration of new chemical entities to make them suitable for therapeutic use . It includes synthetic and computational aspects of the study of existing drugs and agents in development in relation to their bioactivities ( biological activities and properties ) , i.e. , understanding their structure-activity relationships ( SAR ) . Pharmaceutical chemistry is focused on quality aspects of medicines and aims to assure fitness for purpose of medicinal products . At the biological interface , medicinal chemistry combines to form a set of highly interdisciplinary sciences , setting its organic , physical , and computational emphases alongside biological areas such as biochemistry , molecular biology , pharmacognosy and pharmacology , toxicology and veterinary and human medicine ; these , with project management , statistics , and pharmaceutical business practices , systematically oversee altering identified chemical agents such that after pharmaceutical formulation , they are safe and efficacious , and therefore suitable for use in treatment of disease .",

These contrast with benign tumors , which do not spread . Possible signs and symptoms include a lump , abnormal bleeding , prolonged cough , unexplained weight loss , and a change in bowel movements . While these symptoms may indicate cancer , they can also have other causes . Over 100 types of cancers affect humans . Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths . Another 10% are due to obesity , poor diet , lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol . Other factors include certain infections , exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants . In the developing world , 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human papillomavirus infection , Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . These factors act , at least partly , by changing the genes of a cell . Typically , many genetic changes are required before cancer develops . Approximately 5-10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person 's parents .",

  "/wiki/Chemistry": "Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms , molecules and ions : their composition , structure , properties , behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances . In the scope of its subject , chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology . It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level . For example , chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry ( botany ) , the formation of igneous rocks ( geology ) , how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded ( ecology ) , the properties of the soil on the moon ( astrophysics ) , how medications work ( pharmacology ) , and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene ( forensics ) . Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds . There are four types of chemical bonds : covalent bonds , in which compounds share one or more electron ( s ) ; ionic bonds , in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions ( cations and anions ) ; hydrogen bonds ; and Van der Waals force bonds .",

  "/wiki/Artificial_intelligence": "In computer science , artificial intelligence ( AI ) , sometimes called machine intelligence , is intelligence demonstrated by machines , in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans . Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents : any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals . Colloquially , the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines ( or computers ) that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind , such as learning and problem solving . As machines become increasingly capable , tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI , a phenomenon known as the AI effect . A quip in Tesler 's Theorem says AI is whatever has n't been done yet . For instance , optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI , having become a routine technology . Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech , competing at the highest level in strategic game systems ( such as chess and Go ) , autonomously operating cars , intelligent routing in content delivery networks , and military simulations . Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955 , and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism , followed by disappointment and the loss of funding ( known as an AI winter ) , followed by new approaches , success and renewed funding . For most of its history , AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other . These sub-fields are based on technical considerations , such as particular goals ( e.g . robotics or machine learning ) , the use of particular tools ( logic or artificial neural networks ) , or deep philosophical differences . Subfields have also been based on social factors ( particular institutions or the work of particular researchers ) .",

  "/wiki/Magnetism": "Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields . Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field , which acts on other currents and magnetic moments . Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomenon of electromagnetism . The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials , which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets , producing magnetic fields themselves . Only a few substances are ferromagnetic ; the most common ones are iron , cobalt and nickel and their alloys . The prefix ferro- refers to iron , because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone , a form of natural iron ore called magnetite , Fe3O4 . Although ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life , all other materials are influenced to some extent by a magnetic field , by several other types of magnetism . Paramagnetic substances such as aluminum and oxygen are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field ; diamagnetic substances such as copper and carbon are weakly repelled ; while antiferromagnetic materials such as chromium and spin glasses have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field . The force of a magnet on paramagnetic , diamagnetic , and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments , so in everyday life , these substances are often described as non-magnetic . The magnetic state ( or magnetic phase ) of a material depends on temperature and other variables such as pressure and the applied magnetic field . A material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism as these variables change . As with magnetizing a magnet , demagnetizing a magnet is also possible .",
  "/wiki/Nanotechnology": "Nanotechnology ( nanotech ) is manipulation of matter on an atomic , molecular , and supramolecular scale . The earliest , widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products , also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology . A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers . This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale , and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold . It is therefore common to see the plural form nanotechnologies as well as nanoscale technologies to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size . Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad , including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , energy storage , microfabrication , molecular engineering , etc . The associated research and applications are equally diverse , ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly , from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale . Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology . Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications , such as in nanomedicine , nanoelectronics , biomaterials energy production , and consumer products . On the other hand , nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology , including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials , and their potential effects on global economics , as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios . These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .",
  "/wiki/Magnetization": "In classical electromagnetism , magnetization or magnetic polarization is the vector field that expresses the density of permanent or induced magnetic dipole moments in a magnetic material . The origin of the magnetic moments responsible for magnetization can be either microscopic electric currents resulting from the motion of electrons in atoms , or the spin of the electrons or the nuclei . Net magnetization results from the response of a material to an external magnetic field . Paramagnetic materials have a weak induced magnetization in a magnetic field , which disappears when the magnetic field is removed . Ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials have strong magnetization in a magnetic field , and can be magnetized to have magnetization in the absence of an external field , becoming a permanent magnet . Magnetization is not necessarily uniform within a material , but may vary between different points . Magnetization also describes how a material responds to an applied magnetic field as well as the way the material changes the magnetic field , and can be used to calculate the forces that result from those interactions . It can be compared to electric polarization , which is the measure of the corresponding response of a material to an electric field in electrostatics . Physicists and engineers usually define magnetization as the quantity of magnetic moment per unit volume . It is represented by a pseudovector M ."
