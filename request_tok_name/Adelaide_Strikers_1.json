  "/wiki/Fast_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",

  "/wiki/Off-break": "An off break is the type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler . Off breaks are known as off spinners . An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the fingers roll down the right side of the ball ( for a right-handed bowler ) , giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler 's perspective , this is to the left from the batsman 's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the off side . An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries . Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play . This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman 's body , meaning the batsman 's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge . This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break , but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket , assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump . A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling , because the ball moves away from his body .",

  "/wiki/Off_spin": "Off spin is a type of finger spin bowling in cricket . A bowler who uses this technique is called an off spinner . Off spinners are right-handed spin bowlers who use their fingers to spin the ball from a right-handed batsman 's off side to the leg side ( that is , towards the right-handed batsman , or away from a left-handed batsman ) . This contrasts with leg spin , in which the ball spins from leg to off and which is bowled with a very different action . A left-handed bowler who bowls with the same action as an off spinner is known as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler . While the orthodox spinner has the same action as an off-spinner , the ball itself spins in the opposite direction ( akin to a right arm leg spinner ) . Off spin is generally considered less difficult to play than leg spin , as off breaks typically spin less than leg breaks , and do not generally possess the same loopy , potentially deceptive flight . In addition , off spinners tend to have a smaller repertoire of deliveries to choose from . However , the off spinner often bowls faster and more accurately than a leg spinner , and can therefore deceive the batsman with changes in the pace of the ball . Another common weapon of the off spinner is the arm ball , which does not spin but goes straight on with the arm . More skilled offspinners also have the topspinner . Aside from these variations in spin , varying the speed , length and flight of the ball are also important for the off spinner .",

A leg break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers .

A leg spin bowler will bowl mostly leg breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length , and amount of side spin versus topspin of the deliveries . Leg breaks are considered to be one of the more difficult spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play because the ball moves away from their body . This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders . Alternatively , for a ball aimed outside the leg stump , the breaking may be so sharp that the ball goes behind a right-handed batsman and hits the stumps - the batsman is then said ( informally ) to be bowled around his legs .
