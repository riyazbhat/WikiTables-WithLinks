It lies in the South Caucasus on the eastern coast of the Black Sea , south of the Greater Caucasus mountains in northwestern Georgia . It covers 8,660 square kilometres ( 3,340 sq mi ) and has a population of around 240,000 . Its capital is Sukhumi . The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and Georgia-Russia relations . The polity is recognised as a state by Russia , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Nauru and Syria . While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia , the Georgian government and most United Nations member states consider Abkhazia legally part of Georgia , whose constitution designates the area as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia . The region had autonomy within Soviet Georgia at the time when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in the late 1980s . Simmering ethnic tensions between the Abkhaz - the region 's titular ethnicity - and Georgians - the largest single ethnic group at that time - culminated in the 1992-1993 War in Abkhazia which resulted in Georgia 's loss of control of most of Abkhazia , the de facto independence of Abkhazia , and the ethnic cleansing of Georgians from Abkhazia . Despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations , the dispute remains unresolved . The long-term presence of a United Nations Observer Mission and a Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) peacekeeping force failed to prevent the flare-up of violence on several occasions . In August 2008 , Abkhaz and Russian forces fought a war against Georgian forces , which led to the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia , the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement , and the termination of the UN mission .",

Defined in an area of 10,887 square kilometres ( 4,203 sq mi ) , Kosovo is landlocked in the center of the Balkans and bordered by the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east , North Macedonia to the southeast , Albania to the southwest and Montenegro to the west . It possesses varied and diverse landscapes for its size by climate along with geology and hydrology . Most of central Kosovo is dominated by the vast plains and fields of Metohija and Kosovo . The Albanian Alps and \u0160ar Mountains rise in the southwest and southeast respectively . The earliest known human settlements in what is now Kosovo were the Paleolithic Vin\u010da and Star\u010devo cultures . During the Classical period , it was inhabited by the Illyrian-Dardanian and Celtic people . In 168 BC , the area was annexed by the Romans . In the Middle Ages , it was conquered by the Byzantine , Bulgarian , and Serbian Empires . The Battle of Kosovo of 1389 is considered to be one of the defining moments in Serbian medieval history . The region was the core of the Serbian medieval state , which has also been the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church from the 14th century , when its status was upgraded to a patriarchate . Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire from the 15th to the early 20th century .",

Recognised only by Turkey , Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus . Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the northeast to Morphou Bay , Cape Kormakitis and its westernmost point , the Kokkina exclave in the west . Its southernmost point is the village of Louroujina . A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia , the island 's largest city and capital of both sides . A coup d'\u00e9tat in 1974 , performed as part of an attempt to annex the island to Greece , prompted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus . This resulted in the eviction of much of the north 's Greek Cypriot population , the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south , and the partitioning of the island , leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983 . Due to its lack of recognition , Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic , political and military support . Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful . The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus . While its presence is supported and approved by the TRNC government , the Republic of Cyprus , the European Union as a whole , and the international community regard it as an occupation force , and its presence has been denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions .

[ ii ] The entirety of territory claimed by the State of Palestine has been occupied since 1948 , first by Egypt and Jordan and then by Israel after the Six-Day War in 1967 . Palestine has a population of 5,051,953 as of February 2020 , ranked 121st in the world . After World War II , in 1947 , the UN adopted a Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationalized Jerusalem . After the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 , neighboring Arab armies invaded the former British mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces . Later , the All-Palestine Government was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 to govern the Egyptian-controlled enclave in Gaza . It was soon recognized by all Arab League members except Transjordan . Though jurisdiction of the Government was declared to cover the whole of the former Mandatory Palestine , its effective jurisdiction was limited to the Gaza Strip . Israel later captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt , the West Bank ( including East Jerusalem ) from Jordan , and the Golan Heights from Syria in June 1967 following the Six-Day War . On 15 November 1988 , Yasser Arafat , Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , in Algiers proclaimed the establishment of the State of Palestine . A year after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 , the Palestinian National Authority was formed to govern the areas A and B in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .

The Georgian government responded by abolishing South Ossetia 's autonomy and trying to re-establish its control over the region by force . The crisis escalation led to the 1991-92 South Ossetia War . Georgian fighting against those controlling South Ossetia occurred on two other occasions , in 2004 and 2008 . The latter conflict led to the Russo-Georgian War , during which Ossetian and Russian forces gained full de facto control of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast .

The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",
  "/wiki/Taiwan": "Taiwan ( Chinese : \u81fa\u7063 ; pinyin : T\u00e1iw\u0101n ) , [ II ] officially the Republic of China ( ROC ) , [ I ] is a state in East Asia . Neighbouring states include the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to the north-west , Japan to the north-east , and the Philippines to the south . The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",
  "/wiki/Transnistria": "Transnistria or Transdniestria , officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic [ a ] ( PMR ; Russian : \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 ) , is a breakaway state in the narrow strip of land between the river Dniester and the Ukrainian border that is internationally recognized as part of Moldova . Its capital is Tiraspol . Transnistria has been recognised only by three other mostly non-recognised states : Abkhazia , Artsakh , and South Ossetia . Transnistria is designated by the Republic of Moldova as the Transnistria autonomous territorial unit with special legal status ( Romanian : Unitatea teritorial\u0103 autonom\u0103 cu statut juridic special Transnistria ) , or St\u00eenga Nistrului ( Left Bank of the Dniester ) . After the dissolution of the USSR , tensions between Moldova and the breakaway Transnistrian territory escalated into a military conflict that started in March 1992 and was concluded by a ceasefire in July of the same year . As part of that agreement , a three-party ( Russia , Moldova , Transnistria ) Joint Control Commission supervises the security arrangements in the demilitarised zone , comprising twenty localities on both sides of the river . Although the ceasefire has held , the territory 's political status remains unresolved : Transnistria is an unrecognised but de facto independent semi-presidential republic with its own government , parliament , military , police , postal system , currency and vehicle registration . Its authorities have adopted a constitution , flag , national anthem and coat of arms . It is the only country still using the hammer and sickle on its flag , despite not being a communist state . After a 2005 agreement between Moldova and Ukraine , all Transnistrian companies that seek to export goods through the Ukrainian border must be registered with the Moldovan authorities . This agreement was implemented after the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine ( EUBAM ) took force in 2005 . Most Transnistrians also have Moldovan citizenship , but many Transnistrians also have Russian and Ukrainian citizenship .",
