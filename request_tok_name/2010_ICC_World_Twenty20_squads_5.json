  "/wiki/Twenty20_International": "A Twenty20 International ( T20I ) is a form of cricket , played between two of the international members of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , in which each team faces twenty overs . The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard . The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket . Starting from the format 's inception in 2005 , T20I status only applied to Full Members and some Associate Member teams . However , in April 2018 , the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all its 105 members from 1 January 2019 . The shortened format was initially introduced to bolster crowds for the domestic game , and was not intended to be played internationally , but the first Twenty20 International took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand , and the first tournament was played two years later , with the introduction of the ICC T20 World Cup . In 2016 , for the first time in a calendar year , more Twenty20 International matches ( 100 ) were played than ODI matches ( 99 ) . There remain limits on how many Twenty20 Internationals a team can play each year , in order to protect Test cricket and One Day Internationals . As of 3 May 2019 , 80 nations feature in ICC T20I team rankings . Twenty20 International format also sees one mandatory powerplay taken in the first six overs . This shorter format of the game makes reaching the traditional milestones of scoring a century or taking five wickets in an innings more difficult , and few players have achieved these . The highest individual score in a Twenty20 International is 172 , made by Australia 's Aaron Finch against Zimbabwe in 2018 , while India 's Deepak Chahar has the best bowling figures of 6/7 against Bangladesh in November 2019 .",

  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",
  "/wiki/Off_break": "An off break is the type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler . Off breaks are known as off spinners . An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the fingers roll down the right side of the ball ( for a right-handed bowler ) , giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler 's perspective , this is to the left from the batsman 's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the off side . An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries . Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play . This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman 's body , meaning the batsman 's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge . This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break , but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket , assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump . A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling , because the ball moves away from his body .",

  "/wiki/Medium_pace_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",
