  "/wiki/Chinese_architecture": "Chinese architecture demonstrates an architectural style that developed over millennia in China , before spreading out to influence architecture all throughout East Asia . Since the solidification of the style in the early imperial period , the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged , the main changes being only the decorative details . Starting with the Tang dynasty , Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan , Korea , Mongolia , and Vietnam , and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Southeast and South Asia including Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia and The Philippines . Chinese architecture is typified by various features ; such as , bilateral symmetry , use of enclosed open spaces , the incorporation of ideas related to feng shui such as directional hierarchies , a horizontal emphasis , and the allusion to various cosmological , mythological , or other symbolism . Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type , ranging from pagodas to palaces . In part because of an emphasis on the use of wood , a relatively perishable material , and due to a de-emphasis on major monumental structures built of less-organic but more durable materials , much of the historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published planning diagrams and specifications . Some of the architecture of China shows the influence of other types or styles from outside of China , such as the influences on mosque structures originating in the Middle East . Although displaying certain unifying aspects , rather than being completely homogeneous , Chinese architecture has many types of variation based on status or affiliation , such as dependence on whether the structures were constructed for emperors , commoners , or used for religious purposes . Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in the varying styles associated with different geographic regions and in ethnic architectural design .",

In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Indo-Islamic_architecture": "Indo-Islamic architecture is the architecture of the Indian subcontinent produced by and for Islamic patrons and purposes . Despite an initial Arab presence in Sindh , the development of Indo-Islamic architecture began in earnest with the establishment of Delhi as the capital of the Ghurid dynasty in 1193 . Succeeding the Ghurids was the Delhi Sultanate , a series of Central Asian dynasties that consolidated much of North India , and later the Mughal Empire by the 15th century . Both of these dynasties introduced Persianate , Turkic and Islamicate architecture and art styles from Western Eurasia into the Indian subcontinent . The types and forms of large buildings required by Muslim elites , with mosques and tombs much the most common , were very different from those previously built in India . The exteriors of both were very often topped by large domes , and made extensive use of arches . Both of these features were hardly used in Hindu temple architecture and other indigenous Indian styles . Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome , and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to Hindu temple architecture . Islamic buildings initially adapted the skills of a workforce trained in earlier Indian traditions to their own designs . Unlike most of the Islamic world , where brick tended to predominate , India had highly skilled builders well used to producing stone masonry of extremely high quality . Alongside the architecture developed in Delhi and prominent centres of Mughal culture such as Agra , Lahore and Allahabad , a variety of regional styles developed in regional kingdoms like the Bengal , Gujarat , Deccan , Jaunpur and Kashmir Sultanates . By the Mughal period , generally agreed to represent the peak of the style , aspects of Islamic style began to influence architecture made for Hindus , with even temples using scalloped arches , and later domes .",

In literature , architecture , culinary traditions , traditional dress , performing arts , martial arts , and royal court traditions , Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated . The golden age of the Malay sultanates in the Malay Peninsula , Sumatra and Borneo saw many of their inhabitants , particularly from various tribal communities like the Batak , Dayak , Orang Asli and the Orang Laut become subject to Islamisation and Malayisation . Today , some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia , termed as anak dagang ( traders ) and who predominantly consist of Banjar , Bugis , Minangkabau people and Acehnese peoples , while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries . Throughout their history , the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics . They absorbed , shared and transmitted numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups , such as those of Minang , Acehnese , and to some degree Javanese culture ; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture . Ethnic Malays are also the major source of the ethnocultural development of the related Betawi , Banjar , Cape Malay , Cocos Malays and Sri Lankan Malay cultures , as well as the development of Malay trade and creole languages like Ambonese Malay , Baba Malay , the Betawi language and Manado Malay .",
  "/wiki/Architecture_of_Turkey": "Architecture of Turkey or Turkish Architecture in the Republican Period refers to the architecture practised in the territory of present-day Turkey since the foundation of the republic in 1923 . In the first years of the republic , Turkish architecture was influenced by Seljuk and Ottoman architecture , in particular during the First National Architectural Movement ( also called the Turkish Neoclassical architecture movement . ) However , starting from the 1930s , architectural styles began to differ from traditional architecture , also as a result of an increasing number of foreign architects being invited to work in the country , mostly from Germany and Austria . The Second World War was a period of isolation , during which the Second National Architectural Movement emerged . Similar to Fascist architecture , the movement aimed to create a modern but nationalistic architecture . Starting from the 1950s , isolation from the rest of the world began to diminish , which enabled the Turkish architects to experiment with new styles and become increasingly inspired by their counterparts in the rest of the world . However , they were largely constrained by the lack of technological infrastructure or insufficient financial resources until the 1980s . Thereafter , the liberalization of the economy and the shift towards export-led growth paved the way for the private sector to become the leading influence on architecture in Turkey .",

A gateway to the western part of Indonesia , Medan is supported by the Port of Belawan and Kualanamu International Airport , both of which are connected to the city centre via toll road and railway . The city was founded by Guru Patimpus , a Karonese man who named a swampy land in confluence of Deli River and Babura river as Kampung Medan Putri . It later became a part of the Deli Sultanate which was established by Tuanku Gocah Pahlawan in 1632 . In the 18th century , its eighth king , Sultan Mahmud Al Rasyid Perkasa Alam , worked with Jacob Nienhuys , a Dutch tobacco merchant , who pioneered the opening of tobacco plantations in Medan . With the help from the 9th Sultanate Sultan Ma'mun Al Rasyid Perkasa Alam , and also the well-known Chinese businessmen Tjong Yong Hian and Tjong A Fie , the rapid development of the economy transformed Medan into a big trading center with the nickname het land dollar , aka the land of the money .

  "/wiki/Mughal_architecture": "Mughal Architecture is the type of Indo-Islamic architecture developed by the Mughals in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the Indian subcontinent . It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of Islamic , Persian , Turkish and Indian architecture . Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character , including large bulbous domes , slender minarets at the corners , massive halls , large vaulted gateways , and delicate ornamentation ; grandiose architecture was the most visible of the ways that the Mughals used to assert their sense of superiority and their supremacy over what in many ways remained to them an alien land . Examples of the style can be found in modern-day India , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , and Pakistan . The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of Babur at Panipat in 1526 . During his five-year reign , Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings , though few have survived . His grandson Akbar built widely , and the style developed vigorously during his reign . Among his accomplishments were Agra Fort , the fort-city of Fatehpur Sikri , and the Buland Darwaza . Akbar 's son Jahangir commissioned the Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir . Mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of Shah Jahan , who constructed Taj Mahal , the Jama Masjid , the Shalimar Gardens of Lahore , the Wazir Khan Mosque , and who renovated the Lahore Fort . The last of the great Mughal architects was Aurangzeb , who built the Badshahi Mosque .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_architecture": "Spanish architecture refers to architecture in any area of what is now Spain , and by Spanish architects worldwide . The term includes buildings which were constructed within the current borders of Spain prior to its existence as a nation , when the land was called Iberia , Hispania , Al-Andalus or was divided between several Christian kingdoms . Drawing from many different sources , Spanish architecture demonstrates great historical and geographical diversity . Spanish architecture tended to develop along similar lines as other architectural styles around the Mediterranean and from Northern Europe . A real development came with the arrival of the Romans , who left behind some of their most outstanding monuments in Hispania . The arrival of the Visigoths brought about a profound decline in building techniques which was paralleled in the rest of the former Empire . The Moorish conquest in 711 CE led to a radical change and for the following eight centuries there were great advances in culture , including architecture . For example , C\u00f3rdoba was established as the cultural capital of its time under the Muslim Umayyad dynasty . Simultaneously , the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles , at first mostly isolated from European architectural influences , and later integrated into Romanesque and Gothic streams , they reached an extraordinary peak with numerous samples along the whole territory . The Mud\u00e9jar style , from the 12th to 17th centuries , was characterised by the blending of cultural European and Islamic influences . Towards the end of the 15th century , and before influencing Latin America with its Colonial architecture , Spain itself experimented with Renaissance architecture , developed mostly by local architects . Spanish Baroque was distinguished by its exuberant Churrigueresque decoration and the most sober Herrerian style , both developing separately from later international influences .",

Banda Aceh is located on the northwestern tip of Indonesia at the mouth of the Aceh River . The city was originally established as Bandar Aceh Darussalam Kandang and served as a capital and hub for the Sultanate of Aceh upon its foundation in the late 15th century . Later its name was changed to Bandar Aceh Darussalam , and then became popularly known as Banda Aceh . The first part of the name comes from the Persian bandar ( \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631 ) meaning port or haven .

  "/wiki/Indo-Saracenic_Revival_architecture": "Indo-Saracenic , also known as Indo-Gothic , Mughal-Gothic , and , formerly , Hindoo Style , was a revival architectural style mostly used by British architects in India in the later 19th century , especially in public and government buildings in the British Raj , and the palaces of rulers of the princely states . It drew stylistic and decorative elements from native Indo-Islamic architecture , especially Mughal architecture , which the British regarded as the classic Indian style , and less often , Hindu temple architecture . The basic layout and structure of the buildings tended to be close to that used in contemporary buildings in other styles , such as Gothic revival and Neo-Classical , with specific Indian features and decoration added . Saracen is a term used in Europe until the 19th century referring to Muslim and/or Arabic-speaking people and regions of the Middle East and North Africa . The style drew from western depictions of Indian buildings from about 1795 , such as those by William Hodges and the Daniell duo ( William Daniell and his uncle Thomas Daniell ) . The first Indo-Saracenic building is said to be the Chepauk Palace , completed in 1768 , in present-day Chennai ( Madras ) . Bombay and Calcutta ( as they then were ) , as the main centres of the Raj administration , saw many buildings constructed in the style , although Calcutta was also a bastion of European Neo-classical architecture . Most major buildings are now classified under the Heritage buildings category as laid down by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) , and protected . [ citation needed ] The style enjoyed a degree of popularity outside British India , where architects often mixed Islamic and European elements from various areas and periods with boldness , in the prevailing climate of eclecticism in architecture . Through architects and engineers transferred from India , the style was adopted in British Ceylon ( present-day Sri Lanka ) and the Federated Malay States ( present-day Malaysia ) . The British were also keen to transfer the style outside the Indian Empire and the British Far East to the United Kingdom itself , with several examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture going up in the country , for example at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton , and the eccentric Sezincote House in Gloucestershire . The wider European version , also popular in the Americas , is Moorish Revival architecture , which tends to use specific South Asian features less , and instead those characteristic of the Arabic-speaking countries ; Neo-Mud\u00e9jar is the equivalent style in Spain .",

  "/wiki/Palladian_architecture": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today .",

Persian buildings vary from peasant huts to tea houses , and garden pavilions to some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen . In addition to historic gates , palaces , and mosques , the rapid growth of cities such as the capital Tehran has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction . Iranian architecture displays great variety , both structural and aesthetic , from a variety of traditions and experience . Without sudden innovations , and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks , it has achieved an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries . Its paramount virtues are : a marked feeling for form and scale ; structural inventiveness , especially in vault and dome construction ; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture . Traditionally , the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic symbolism by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven . This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia , but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well .

  "/wiki/Rationalism_(architecture)": "In architecture , rationalism is an architectural current which mostly developed from Italy in the 1920s and 1930s . Vitruvius had claimed in his work De architectura that architecture is a science that can be comprehended rationally . This formulation was taken up and further developed in the architectural treatises of the Renaissance . Progressive art theory of the 18th-century opposed the Baroque use of illusionism with the classic beauty of truth and reason . Twentieth-century rationalism derived less from a special , unified theoretical work than from a common belief that the most varied problems posed by the real world could be resolved by reason . In that respect it represented a reaction to historicism and a contrast to Art Nouveau and Expressionism . The term rationalist architecture is commonly used to refer to the wider International Style .",

  "/wiki/Baiturrahim_Mosque": "Baiturrahim Mosque is a mosque located in Ulee Lheue , Meuraksa sub-district , Aceh Province , Indonesia . As a legacy of the Sultan of Aceh in the 17th Century , it is one of the historical mosques in Indonesia . Back then the mosque was named Jami Ulee Lheu Mosque . In 1873 , when the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque was burned by the Dutch , all the worshipers held a Friday prayer at Ulee Lheue . Since then the name of the mosque became Baiturrahim Mosque . Since its establishment , the mosque has been restored several times . Initially the building was completely made out of wood , with a simple shape and was located next to the location of the present mosque . Because it was made out of wood , building did not last long as weathering had torn the building down . In 1922 the mosque was re-built with long-lasting material by the Government of Dutch East Indies with European architectural style . But this construction did not use iron or bone braces , and built with bricks and cement only . In 1983 , Banda Aceh was rocked by a devastating earthquake and it undermined the dome of the mosque . After that people rebuilt the mosque but they no longer installed the dome , thus replacing it with an ordinary roof ."
