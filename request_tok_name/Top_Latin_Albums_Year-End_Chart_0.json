  "/wiki/Top_Latin_Albums": "Top Latin Albums is a record chart published by Billboard magazine and is labeled as the most important music chart for Spanish language , full-length albums in the American music market . Like all Billboard album charts , the chart is based on sales . Nielsen SoundScan compiles the sales data from merchants representing more than 90 percent of the U.S. music retail market . The sample includes sales at music stores , the music departments of electronics and department stores , direct-to-consumer transactions , and Internet sales of physical albums or digital downloads . A limited array of verifiable sales from concert venues is also tabulated . To rank on this chart , an album must have 51% or more of its content recorded in Spanish . Listings of Top Latin Albums are also shown on Telemundo 's music page through a partnership between the two companies . Before this , the first chart regarding Latin music albums in the magazine ( Billboard Hot Latin Albums in Texas ) was published on the issue dated December 30 , 1972 . Then , all Latin music information was featured on the Latin Pop Albums chart , which began on June 29 , 1985 , and is still running along with the Regional Mexican Albums and Tropical Albums chart . The Latin Pop Albums chart features music only from the pop genre , while the Regional Mexican Albums chart includes information from different genres like duranguense , norte\u00f1o , banda and mariachi , and the Tropical Albums includes different genres particularly salsa , merengue , bachata , and cumbia . In 2005 , another chart ; Latin Rhythm Albums was introduced in response to growing number of airplays from reggaeton . On the week ending January 31 , 2017 , Billboard updated the methodology to compile the Top Latin Albums chart into a multi-metric methodology to include track equivalent album units and streaming equivalent albums units .",
