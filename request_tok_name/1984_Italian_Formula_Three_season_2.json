  "/wiki/Autodromo_Nazionale_Monza": "The Autodromo Nazionale di Monza is a historic race track near the city of Monza , north of Milan , in Italy . Built in 1922 , it is the world 's third purpose-built motor racing circuit after those of Brooklands and Indianapolis . The circuit 's biggest event is the Formula One Italian Grand Prix . Except 1980 , the race has been hosted there since the series 's inception . Built in the Royal Villa of Monza park in a woodland setting , the site has three tracks - the Grand Prix track , the Junior track , and a high speed oval track with steep bankings which has been unused for many decades and is now decaying . The major features of the main Grand Prix track include the Curva Grande , the Curva di Lesmo , the Variante Ascari and the Curva Parabolica . The high speed curve , Curva Grande , is located after the Variante del Rettifilo which is located at the end of the front straight or Rettifilo Tribune , and is usually taken flat out by Formula One cars . Drivers are on full throttle for most of the lap due to its long straights and fast corners , and is usually the scenario in which the open-wheeled Formula One cars show the raw speed of which they are capable : during the mid-2000s V10 engine formula , although in 2012 with the 2.4L V8 engines , top speeds in Formula One rarely reached over ; the 1.6L turbocharged hybrid V6 engine , reduced-downforce formula of 2014 displayed top speeds of up to . The circuit is generally flat , but has a gradual gradient from the second Lesmos to the Variante Ascari . Due to the low aerodynamic profile needed , with its resulting low downforce , the grip is very low ; understeer is a more serious issue than at other circuits ; however , the opposite effect , oversteer , is also present in the second sector , requiring the use of a very distinctive opposite lock technique . Since both maximum power and minimal drag are keys for speed on the straights , only competitors with enough power or aerodynamic efficiency at their disposal are able to challenge for the top places . In addition to Formula One , the circuit previously hosted the 1000 km Monza , and endurance sports car race held as part of the World Sportscar Championship and the Le Mans Series .",
