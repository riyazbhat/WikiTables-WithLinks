  "/wiki/Jazz_Dance": "Jazz dance is a performance dance technique and style that first emerged in Brazil in the early twentieth century . Jazz dance may refer to vernacular jazz or to Broadway or theatrical jazz . Both genres build on African American vernacular styles of dancing that emerged with jazz music . Vernacular jazz dance includes ragtime dances , Charleston , Lindy hop , and mambo . Popular vernacular jazz dance performers include The Whitman Sisters , Florence Mills , Ethel Waters , Al & Leon , Frankie Manning , Norma Miller , Dawn Hampton , and Katherine Dunham . Theatrical jazz dance performed on the concert stage was popularized by Jack Cole , Bob Fosse , Eugene Louis Faccuito , and Gus Giordano . The term 'jazz dance ' has been used in ways that have little or nothing to do with jazz music . Since the 1940s , Hollywood movies and Broadway shows have used the term to describe the choreographies of Bob Fosse and Jerome Robbins . In the 1990s , colleges and universities applied to the term to classes offered by physical education departments in which students dance to various forms of pop music , rarely jazz .",

It also employs contract-release , floor work , fall and recovery , and improvisation characteristics of modern dance . Unpredictable changes in rhythm , speed , and direction are often used , as well . Additionally , contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures , such as elements from African dance including bent knees , or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance , Butoh .",

  "/wiki/Hip-Hop": "Hip hop or hip-hop , is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans , Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx , New York City . The origin of the name is often disputed . It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx . While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music ( including rap ) , hip hop is characterized by nine elements , of which only four are considered essential to understanding hip hop musically . Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined these main pillars of hip hop culture , coining the terms : rapping ( also called MCing or emceeing ) , a rhythmic vocal rhyming style ( orality ) ; DJing ( and turntablism ) , which is making music with record players and DJ mixers ( aural/sound and music creation ) ; b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing ( movement/dance ) ; and graffiti . Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are : hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement ( intellectual/philosophical ) ; beatboxing , a percussive vocal style ; street entrepreneurship ; hip hop language ; and hip hop fashion and style , among others . The fifth element , although debated , is commonly considered either street knowledge , hip hop fashion , or beatboxing . The Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Black Spades , an African-American group that has been described as being a gang , a club , and a music group . Brother-sister duo Clive Campbell , a.k.a . DJ Kool Herc , and Cindy Campbell additionally hosted DJ parties in the Bronx and are credited for the rise in the genre . Hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world . These elements were adapted and developed considerably , particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades .",

  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position . While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position . He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security . During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35 . The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized . He composed more than 600 works , many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music . He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music .
