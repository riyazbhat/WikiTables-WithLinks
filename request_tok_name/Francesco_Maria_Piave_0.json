  "/wiki/Giovanni_Pacini": "Giovanni Pacini ( 17 February 1796 - 6 December 1867 ) was an Italian composer , best known for his operas . Pacini was born in Catania , Sicily , the son of the buffo Luigi Pacini , who was to appear in the premieres of many of Giovanni 's operas . The family was of Tuscan origin , living in Catania when the composer was born . His first 25 or so operas were written when Gioachino Rossini dominated the Italian operatic stage . But Pacini 's operas were rather superficial , a fact which , later , he candidly admitted in his Memoirs . For some years he held the post of director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples . Later , retiring to Viareggio to found a school of music , Pacini took time to assess the state of opera in Italy and , during a five-year period during which he stopped composing , laid out his ideas in his Memoirs . Like Saverio Mercadante , who also reassessed the strength and weaknesses of this period in opera , Pacini 's style did change , but he quickly became eclipsed by the rising influence of Giuseppe Verdi on the Italian operatic scene , and many of his operas appeared to be old fashioned and rarely , if ever , appeared outside of Italy . Pacini 's work is largely forgotten today , although some recordings do exist .",
  "/wiki/Ernani": "Ernani is an operatic dramma lirico in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave , based on the play Hernani by Victor Hugo . Verdi was commissioned by the Teatro La Fenice in Venice to write an opera , but finding the right subject took some time , and the composer worked with the inexperienced Piave in shaping first one and then another drama by Hugo into an acceptable libretto . As musicologist Roger Parker notes , the composer intervened on several important points , insisting for example that the role of Ernani be sung by a tenor ( rather than by a contralto as had originally been planned ) . Ernani was first performed on 9 March 1844 and it was immensely popular , and was revived countless times during its early years . It became Verdi 's most popular opera until it was superseded by Il trovatore after 1853 . In 1904 it became the first opera to be recorded completely .",
  "/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi": "Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi ( Italian : [ d\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bppe \u02c8verdi ] ; 9 or 10 October 1813 - 27 January 1901 ) was an Italian opera composer . He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means , and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron . Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini , Gaetano Donizetti , and Gioachino Rossini , whose works significantly influenced him . In his early operas , Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy . He also participated briefly as an elected politician . The chorus Va , pensiero from his early opera Nabucco ( 1842 ) , and similar choruses in later operas , were much in the spirit of the unification movement , and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals . An intensely private person , Verdi , however , did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region . He surprised the musical world by returning , after his success with the opera Aida ( 1871 ) , with three late masterpieces : his Requiem ( 1874 ) , and the operas Otello ( 1887 ) and Falstaff ( 1893 ) . His operas remain extremely popular , especially the three peaks of his 'middle period ' : Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata , and the 2013 bicentenary of his birth was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances .",
  "/wiki/I_due_Foscari": "I due Foscari ( The Two Foscari ) is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave , based on a historical play , The Two Foscari by Lord Byron . After his success with Ernani , Verdi received a commission from Rome 's Teatro Argentina and he went to work with Piave in considering two subjects , one of which eventually became this opera . I due Foscari was given its premiere performance in Rome on 3 November 1844 and was generally quite successful , although not on the scale of Ernani , which remained Verdi 's most popular opera until Il trovatore in 1853 .",
  "/wiki/Attila_(opera)": "Attila is an opera in a prologue and three acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Temistocle Solera , based on the 1809 play Attila , K\u00f6nig der Hunnen ( Attila , King of the Huns ) by Zacharias Werner . The opera received its first performance at La Fenice in Venice on 17 March 1846 . Ezio 's act 2 aria of heroic resolution \u00c8 gettata la mia sorte ( My lot is cast , I am prepared for any warfare ) is a fine example of a characteristic Verdian genre , and it achieved fame in its own time with audiences in the context of the adoption of a liberal constitution by Ferdinand II . Other contemporary comment praised the work as suitable for the political education of the people , while , in contrast , others criticised the opera as Teutonic in nature .",
  "/wiki/Federico_Ricci": "Federico Ricci ( 22 October 1809 - 10 December 1877 ) , was an Italian composer , particularly of operas . Born in Naples , he was the younger brother of Luigi Ricci , with whom he collaborated on several works . Federico studied at Naples as had his brother . His first big success was with La prigione di Edimburgo , one of his best serious works . He stayed with serious subjects for several years , and of these Corrado d'Altamura was a particular success . However , his last collaboration with his brother , a comedy called Crispino e la comare , was hailed as the masterpiece of both composers , so Federico devoted himself thereafter entirely to comedy . After another success closely followed by a major flop in Vienna , Federico took an official job teaching in St Petersburg and for 16 years he wrote no operas . In 1869 he moved to Paris , and there Une folie \u00e0 Rome ran for 77 nights ; other French comedies of his - mainly revisions of his own and his brother 's earlier works - found some success . He also contributed the Recordare Jesu in the Sequentia to the Messa per Rossini . In 1870 for Cremona he created a pastiche , La vergine di Kermo , containing music by Pedrotti , Cagnoni , Ponchielli , Pacini , Rossi , and Mazzucato . Although he did not have his brother 's energy , Federico 's scores are judged by some to be more skilfully written than Luigi 's : for example , it has been said that La prigione di Edimburgo shows a sensitivity towards its subject ( from Sir Walter Scott 's The Heart of Midlothian ) that is rare among Italian operas of the period . He died in Conegliano .",
  "/wiki/Macbeth_(opera)": "Macbeth ( Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8makbet ; mak\u02c8b\u025bt ] ) is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi , with an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave and additions by Andrea Maffei , based on William Shakespeare 's play of the same name . Written for the Teatro della Pergola in Florence , it was Verdi 's tenth opera and premiered on 14 March 1847 . Macbeth was the first Shakespeare play that Verdi adapted for the operatic stage . Almost twenty years later , Macbeth was revised and expanded in a French version and given in Paris on 19 April 1865 . After the success of Attila in 1846 , by which time the composer had become well established , Macbeth came before the great successes of 1851 to 1853 ( Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata ) which propelled him into universal fame . As sources , Shakespeare 's plays provided Verdi with lifelong inspiration : some , such as an adaption of King Lear ( as Re Lear ) were never realized , but he wrote his two final operas using Othello as the basis for Otello ( 1887 ) and The Merry Wives of Windsor as the basis for Falstaff ( 1893 ) . The first version of Macbeth was completed during the time which Verdi described as his galley years , which ranged over a period of 16 years , and one which saw the composer produce 22 operas . By the standards of the subject matter of almost all Italian operas during the first fifty years of the 19th century , Macbeth was highly unusual . The 1847 version was very successful and it was presented widely . Pleased with his opera and with its reception , Verdi wrote to Antonio Barezzi , his former father-in-law and long-time supporter about two weeks after the premiere :",

  "/wiki/Saverio_Mercadante": "Giuseppe Saverio Raffaele Mercadante ( baptised 17 September 1795 - 17 December 1870 ) was an Italian composer , particularly of operas . While Mercadante may not have retained the international celebrity of Gaetano Donizetti or Gioachino Rossini beyond his own lifetime , he composed as prolific a number of works as either ; and his development of operatic structures , melodic styles and orchestration contributed significantly to the foundations upon which Giuseppe Verdi built his dramatic technique .",

  "/wiki/Stiffelio": "Stiffelio is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi , from an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave . The origin of this was the novel Le pasteur dhommes , by \u00c9mile Souvestre , which was published in 1838 . This was adapted into the French play Le pasteur , ou L'\u00e9vangile et le foyer by \u00c9mile Souvestre and Eug\u00e8ne Bourgeois . That was in turn translated into Italian by Gaetano Vestri as Stifellius ; this formed the basis of Piave 's libretto . Verdi 's experience in Naples for Luisa Miller had not been a good one and he returned home to Busseto to consider the subject for his next opera . The idea for Stiffelio came from his librettist and , entering into a contract with his publisher , Ricordi , he agreed to proceed , leaving the decision as to the location of the premiere to Ricordi . This became the Teatro Grande ( now the Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Verdi ) in Trieste and , in spite of difficulties with the censors which resulted in cuts and changes , the opera - Verdi 's 16th - was first performed on 16 November 1850 .",
  "/wiki/Rigoletto": "Rigoletto ( pronounced [ ri\u0261o\u02c8letto ] ) is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi . The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo . Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time , the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851 . It is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi 's middle-to-late career . Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua , his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto , and Rigoletto 's beautiful daughter Gilda . The opera 's original title , La maledizione ( The Curse ) , refers to a curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by a courtier whose daughter the Duke has seduced with Rigoletto 's encouragement . The curse comes to fruition when Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassin hired by her father ."
