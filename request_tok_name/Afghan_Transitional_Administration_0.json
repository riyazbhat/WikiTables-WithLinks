They primarily live in Afghanistan and Pakistan . A substantial majority of ethnic Pashtuns share Pashto - an Eastern Iranic language in the Indo-European language family - as the native language . Globally , the Pashtuns are estimated to number around 50 million , but an accurate count remains elusive due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979 . The majority of the Pashtuns live in the region regarded as Pashtunistan , which has been split between two countries since the Durand Line border was formed after the Second Anglo-Afghan War . The Pashtuns are a significant minority group in Pakistan , where they constitute the second-largest ethnic group or about 15 percent of the population . Smaller , but still significant Pashtun diaspora communities exist in Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan , especially in the cities of Karachi and Lahore , and in the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh , India . A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf , primarily in the United Arab Emirates . As the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan ( anywhere between 42 and 60 percent of the population ) , Pashtuns have been the dominant ethno-linguistic group for over 300 years . During the Delhi Sultanate era , the 15th-16th century Lodi dynasty briefly replaced the preexisting rulers in North India until Babur completely deposed the Lodi dynasty . Other Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century , which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani . The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the Great Game from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires .",

  "/wiki/Shiite_Muslim": "Shia Islam or Shi'ism is one of the two main branches of Islam . It holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the Imam ( leader ) after him , most notably at the event of Ghadir Khumm , but was prevented from the caliphate as a result of the incident of Saqifah . This view primarily contrasts with that of Sunni Islam , whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider Abu Bakr , who was appointed caliph by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah , to be the first rightful caliph after the Prophet . Unlike the first three Rashidun caliphs , Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad , Banu Hashim , as well as being the prophet 's cousin and being the first male to become Muslim . Shia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam : as of the late 2000s , Shia Muslims constituted 10-15% of all Muslims . Twelver Shia is the largest branch of Shia Islam , with 2012 estimates saying that 85% of Shias were Twelvers . Shia Islam is based on the prophet 's hadith ( Ghadir Khumm ) . Shia consider Ali to have been divinely appointed as the successor to Muhammad , and as the first Imam . The Shia also extend this Imammah to Muhammad 's family , the Ahl al-Bayt ( the people/family of the House ) , and some individuals among his descendants , known as Imams , who they believe possess special spiritual and political authority over the community , infallibility and other divinely ordained traits . Although there are many Shia subsects , modern Shia Islam has been divided into two main groupings : Twelvers and Ismailis , with Twelver Shia being the largest and most influential group among Shia .",
