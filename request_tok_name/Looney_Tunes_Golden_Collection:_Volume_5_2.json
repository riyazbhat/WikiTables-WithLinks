  "/wiki/Bugs_Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character , created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc . Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films , produced by Warner Bros . Though a similar character called Happy Rabbit debuted in the WB cartoon Porky 's Hare Hunt ( 1938 ) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts , the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery 's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) . Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant , insouciant personality . He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase Eh.What 's up , doc ? . Due to Bugs ' popularity during the golden age of American animation , he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment , but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world . He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos . Since his debut , Bugs has appeared in various short films , feature films , compilations , TV series , music records , comics , video games , award shows , amusement park rides , and commercials . He has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character , is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in the world , and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

  "/wiki/Elmer_Fudd": "Elmer J. Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series , and an adversary of Bugs Bunny . He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) . His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters . He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a scwewy wabbit . Elmer 's signature catchphrase is , Shhh . Be vewy vewy quiet , I 'm hunting wabbits , as well as his trademark laughter . The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones ' work What 's Opera , Doc ? ( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the Hunting Trilogy of Rabbit Season/Duck Season shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! ) with Fudd , Bugs Bunny , and Daffy Duck . An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer 's aspects before the character 's more conspicuous features were set .",

Daffy was one of the first of the new screwball characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier during the decade , such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye . Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age , making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons , behind Bugs Bunny 's 167 appearances and Porky Pig 's 162 appearances . Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character . Directors such as Bob Clampett , Robert McKimson , and Chuck Jones are notable examples of the character .

  "/wiki/Wagon_Heels": "Wagon Heels is a Merrie Melodies short directed by Bob Clampett . Released on July 28 , 1945 , it is a color remake of the 1938 Looney Tunes black-and-white short Injun Trouble . Because of its perceived wildly stereotypical and insensitive depiction of the Native American , it is seldom shown on television . [ citation needed ] All voices except narration and Sloppy Moe are performed by Mel Blanc , whose screen credit is his first in a non-Bugs Bunny cartoon . In addition to the usual Native American stereotype music , Carl Stalling 's underscore frequently plays segments of the American Civil War tune , Kingdom Coming , even converting it to a minor key in one segment . Oh ! Susanna is also heard repeatedly in the underscore .",

  "/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Kitties": "A Tale of Two Kitties is a 1942 Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Bob Clampett , written by Warren Foster , and features music by Carl W. Stalling . This short subject is notable for being Tweety Bird 's debut , although known as Orson in this short , according to the staff . It was also the first appearance of Babbit and Catstello , based on the popular comedy duo Abbott and Costello . The title is an obvious pun on the Charles Dickens classic , A Tale of Two Cities . Even in this initial appearance , Tweety reveals early on that his cute appearance masks a willingness to be merciless , even sadistic , towards anyone who threatens him . After slipping one of the cats a bomb which explodes ( offscreen ) , the bird remarks , Aw , da poor putty tat - he cwushed his widdow head ! Followed by a big grin . ( This line was patterned after a catchphrase from a Red Skelton character , and would be used in other Warner cartoons , such as Easter Yeggs . ) This is one of the few Tweety shorts that did not feature his main antagonist Sylvester , who would make his official debut in Life with Feathers ( 1945 ) . A Tale of Two Kitties is remarkable due to a clearly adult reference in 1942 . Catstello broke the fourth wall , took a direct shot at the Hays Office , and made a thinly-veiled reference to giving the middle finger . United Artists failed to renew the copyright in time in 1970 , so the short is now in the public domain in the United States .",
