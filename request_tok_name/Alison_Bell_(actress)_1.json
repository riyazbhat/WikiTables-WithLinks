  "/wiki/King_Lear": "King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare . It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters , after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner . His third daughter gets nothing , because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done . When he feels disrespected by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power , he becomes furious to the point of madness . He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter , just before tragedy strikes her and then the king . Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain , a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king , the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures , with the title role coveted by many of the world 's most accomplished actors . The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play , originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. Stephen 's Day in 1606 , was a 1608 publication in a quarto of uncertain provenance , in which the play is listed as a history ; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text . The Tragedy of King Lear , a revised version that is better tailored for performance , was included in the 1623 First Folio . Modern editors usually conflate the two , though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved . After the English Restoration , the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone , but since the 19th century Shakespeare 's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements . The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship . George Bernard Shaw wrote No man will ever write a better tragedy than Lear .",

  "/wiki/Betrayal_(play)": "Betrayal is a play written by Harold Pinter in 1978 . Critically regarded as one of the English playwright 's major dramatic works , it features his characteristically economical dialogue , characters ' hidden emotions and veiled motivations , and their self-absorbed competitive one-upmanship , face-saving , dishonesty , and ( self- ) deceptions . Inspired by Pinter 's clandestine extramarital affair with BBC Television presenter Joan Bakewell , which spanned seven years , from 1962 to 1969 , the plot of Betrayal integrates different permutations of betrayal relating to a seven-year affair involving a married couple , Emma and Robert , and Robert 's close friend Jerry , who is also married , to a woman named Judith . For five years Jerry and Emma carry on their affair without Robert 's knowledge , both cuckolding Robert and betraying Judith , until Emma , without telling Jerry she has done so , admits her infidelity to Robert ( in effect , betraying Jerry ) , although she continues their affair . In 1977 , four years after exposing the affair ( in 1973 ) and two years after their subsequent break up ( in 1975 ) , Emma meets Jerry to tell him that her marriage to Robert is over . She then lies to Jerry in telling him that , last night , she had to reveal the truth to Robert and that he now knows of the affair . The truth however , is that Robert has known about the affair for the past four years . Pinter 's particular usage of reverse chronology in structuring the plot is innovative : the first scene takes place after the affair has ended , in 1977 ; the final scene ends when the affair begins , in 1968 ; and , in between 1977 and 1968 , scenes in two pivotal years ( 1977 and 1973 ) move forward chronologically . As Roger Ebert observes , in his review of the 1983 film , based on Pinter 's own screenplay , The Betrayal structure strips away all artifice . In this view , the play shows , heartlessly , that the very capacity for love itself is sometimes based on betraying not only other loved ones , but even ourselves . Still , drawing on the frequently commented influence of Proust 's In Search of Lost Time and Pinter 's work on 1977 's The Proust Screenplay on Betrayal , more emotionally complex interpretations are possible based on a stress on dual motions , one forward in calendar time toward disillusion and one backward toward the redemptive recovery of time , in each work .",
