  "/wiki/James_Braid_(golfer)": "James Braid ( 6 February 1870 - 27 November 1950 ) was a Scottish professional golfer and a member of the Great Triumvirate of the sport alongside Harry Vardon and John Henry Taylor . He won The Open Championship five times . He also was a renowned golf course architect . Braid is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame . Braid was born in Earlsferry , Fife , Scotland , the son of James and Mary ( n\u00e9e Harris ) . He played golf from an early age , working as a clubmaker before turning professional in 1896 . Initially his game was hindered by problems with his putting , but he overcame this after switching to an aluminium putter in 1900 . He won The Open Championship in 1901 , 1905 , 1906 , 1908 and 1910 . In addition , Braid won four British PGA Matchplay Championships ( 1903 , 1905 , 1907 and 1911 ) , as well as the 1910 French Open title . He was also runner-up in The Open Championship in 1897 , 1902 , 1904 , and 1909 . His 1906 victory in The Open Championship was the last successful defence of the title by a European until P\u00e1draig Harrington replicated the feat in 2008 . In 1912 , Braid scaled back his tournament golf , and became a full-time club professional at Walton Heath ; he had begun a relationship with that London-area club more than a decade before .",
  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

  "/wiki/Jersey": "Jersey ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u025c\u02d0rzi/ JUR-zee , French : [ \u0292\u025b\u0281z\u025b ] ( listen ) ; J\u00e8rriais : J\u00e8rri [ d\u0292\u025bri ] ) , officially the Bailiwick of Jersey ( French : Bailliage de Jersey ; J\u00e8rriais : Bailliage d\u00e9 J\u00e8rri ) , is a British Crown dependency located near the coast of Normandy , France . It is the second-closest of the Channel Islands to France , after Alderney . Jersey was part of the Duchy of Normandy , whose dukes went on to become kings of England from 1066 . After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the 13th century , and the ducal title surrendered to France , Jersey and the other Channel Islands remained attached to the English crown . The bailiwick consists of the island of Jersey , the largest of the Channel Islands , along with surrounding uninhabited islands and rocks collectively named Les Dirouilles , Les \u00c9cr\u00e9hous , Les Minquiers , Les Pierres de Lecq , and other reefs . Although the bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are often referred to collectively as the Channel Islands , the Channel Islands are not a constitutional or political unit . Jersey has a separate relationship to the Crown from the other Crown dependencies of Guernsey and the Isle of Man , although all are held by the monarch of the United Kingdom . Jersey is a self-governing parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy , with its own financial , legal and judicial systems , and the power of self-determination . The Lieutenant Governor on the island is the personal representative of the Queen . Jersey is not part of the United Kingdom , and has an international identity separate from that of the UK , but the UK is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey . The definition of United Kingdom in the British Nationality Act 1981 is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together.The European Commission confirmed in a written reply to the European Parliament in 2003 that Jersey was within the Union as a European Territory for whose external relationships the UK is responsible . Jersey was not fully part of the European Union but had a special relationship with it , notably being treated as within the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods ."
