  "/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption:_The_Man_from_Blackwater": "The development of Red Dead Redemption began in 2005 . Rockstar Games released Red Dead Redemption on May 18 , 2010 , for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . One of their studios , Rockstar San Diego , oversaw the work , sharing it with other studios around the world . [ a ] The development team considered the game a spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver . Red Dead Redemption was delayed numerous times through its four-year development , often attributed to technological problems . The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints from staff members . Red Dead Redemption was officially announced in 2009 ; it was heavily promoted and widely anticipated . Rockstar improved their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine ( RAGE ) to increase its animation and draw distance rendering capabilities . The game uses the Euphoria and Bullet engines for further animation and environment rendering tasks .

  "/wiki/Machinima": "Machinima ( /m\u0259\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0n\u026am\u0259 , -\u02c8\u0283\u026an-/ ) is the use of real-time computer graphics engines to create a cinematic production . Most often , video games are used to generate the computer animation . Machinima-based artists , sometimes called machinimists or machinimators , are often fan laborers , by virtue of their re-use of copyrighted materials ( see below ) . Machinima offers to provide an archive of gaming performance and access to the look and feel of software and hardware that may already have become unavailable or even obsolete . For game studies , Machinimas gestures grant access to gaming 's historical conditions of possibility and how machinima offers links to a comparative horizon that informs , changes , and fully participates in videogame culture . The practice of using graphics engines from video games arose from the animated software introductions of the 1980s demoscene , Disney Interactive Studios ' 1992 video game Stunt Island , and 1990s recordings of gameplay in first-person shooter ( FPS ) video games , such as id Software 's Doom and Quake . Originally , these recordings documented speedruns - attempts to complete a level as quickly as possible - and multiplayer matches . The addition of storylines to these films created Quake movies . The more general term machinima , a blend of machine and cinema , arose when the concept spread beyond the Quake series to other games and software . After this generalization , machinima appeared in mainstream media , including television series and advertisements . Machinima has advantages and disadvantages when compared to other styles of filmmaking . Its relative simplicity over traditional frame-based animation limits control and range of expression .",
