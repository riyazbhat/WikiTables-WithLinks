  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_birds": "Below is a list of U.S. state birds as designated by each state 's legislature , as well as the District of Columbia 's state bird . The list also contains U.S. territory birds as designated by each territory 's legislature . The selection of state birds began in 1927 , when the legislatures for Alabama , Florida , Maine , Missouri , Oregon , Texas and Wyoming selected their state birds . The last state to choose its bird was Arizona in 1973 . Alaska , California , and South Dakota permit hunting of their state birds . Pennsylvania has adopted a state game bird but not a state bird , while Alabama , Georgia , Massachusetts , Missouri , Oklahoma , South Carolina , and Tennessee have designated an additional state game bird for the purpose of hunting . The northern cardinal is the state bird of seven states , followed by the western meadowlark as the state bird of six states . Several states have extinct official animals , such as state dinosaurs in addition to state insects , state butterflies , state mammals and state reptiles . The District of Columbia designated a district bird in 1938 . Each of the five inhabited territories of the United States has a designated territorial bird ( except for American Samoa ) .",
  "/wiki/Cardinal_(bird)": "Cardinals , in the family Cardinalidae , are passerine birds found in North and South America . They are also known as cardinal-grosbeaks and cardinal-buntings . The South American cardinals in the genus Paroaria are placed in the tanager family Thraupidae . Contrariwise , DNA analysis of the genera Piranga ( which includes the scarlet tanager , summer tanager , and western tanager ) , Chlorothraupis , and Habia showed their closer relationship to the cardinal family . They have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithological Society .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_butterflies": "State insects are designated by 48 individual states of the fifty United States . Some states have more than one designated insect , or have multiple categories ( e.g. , state insect and state butterfly , etc. ) . More than half of the insects chosen are not native to North America , because of the inclusion of three European species ( European honey bee , European mantis , and 7-spotted ladybird ) , each having been chosen by multiple states .",
  "/wiki/Papilio_glaucus": "Papilio glaucus , the eastern tiger swallowtail , is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern North America . It is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern United States , where it is common in many different habitats . It flies from spring to fall , during which it produces two to three broods . Adults feed on the nectar of many species of flowers , mostly from those of the families Apocynaceae , Asteraceae , and Fabaceae . P. glaucus has a wingspan measuring . The male is yellow with four black tiger stripes on each forewing . Females may be either yellow or black , making them dimorphic . The yellow morph is similar to the male , but with a conspicuous band of blue spots along the hindwing , while the dark morph is almost completely black . The green eggs are laid singly on plants of the families Magnoliaceae and Rosaceae . Young caterpillars are brown and white ; older ones are green with two black , yellow , and blue eyespots on the thorax . The caterpillar will turn brown prior to pupating . It will reach a length of .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_mammals": "A state mammal is the official mammal of a U.S. state as designated by a state 's legislature . The first column of the table is for those denoted as the state mammal , and the second shows the state marine mammals . Animals with more specific designations are also listed . Many states also have separately officially designated state birds , state fish , state butterflies , state reptiles , and other animals . Listed separately are state dogs and state horses .",
  "/wiki/Plott_Hound": "The Plott Hound is a large scent hound , originally bred for hunting bears . In 1989 , the North Carolina General Assembly designated the Plott Hound as the official State Dog . The Plott Hound was first registered with the United Kennel Club in 1946 . Plott Hounds were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2006 and were exhibited at the Westminster Show in 2008 . Chosen for their tracking and hunting abilities , two Plott Hound puppies have been trained as K9 deputies for the Guilford County Sheriff 's Department .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_fossils": "Most American states have made a state fossil designation , in many cases during the 1980s . It is common to designate one species in which fossilization has occurred , rather than a single specimen , or a category of fossils not limited to a single species . Some states that lack an explicit state fossil have nevertheless singled out a fossil for formal designation as a state dinosaur , rock , gem or stone .",
  "/wiki/Megalodon": "Megalodon ( Carcharocles megalodon ) , meaning big tooth , is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago ( mya ) , during the Early Miocene to the Pliocene . It was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae , and a close relative of the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) . However , presently there is near unanimous consensus that it belongs to the extinct family Otodontidae , which diverged from the ancestry of the great white shark during the Early Cretaceous . Its genus placement is still debated , authors placing it in either Carcharocles , Megaselachus , Otodus , or Procarcharodon . This is because transitional fossils have been found showing that Megalodon is the final chronospecies of a lineage of giant sharks originally of the genus Otodus which evolved during the Paleocene . While regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators to have ever lived , megalodon is known from fragmentary remains and its appearance and maximum size are uncertain . Scientists differ on whether it would have more closely resembled a stockier version of the great white shark , the basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus ) or the sand tiger shark ( Carcharias taurus ) . Most estimates of megalodon 's size extrapolate from teeth ; with maximum length estimates up to and average length estimates of . Estimates suggest their large jaws could exert a bite force of up to . Their teeth were thick and robust , built for grabbing prey and breaking bone . Megalodon probably had a major impact on the structure of marine communities . The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution .",

  "/wiki/Brook_trout": "The brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) is a species of freshwater fish in the char genus Salvelinus of the salmon family Salmonidae . It is native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada , but has been introduced elsewhere in North America , as well as to Iceland , Europe , and Asia . In parts of its range , it is also known as the eastern brook trout , speckled trout , brook charr , squaretail , or mud trout , among others . A potamodromous population in Lake Superior , as well as an anadromous population in Maine , is known as coaster trout or , simply , as coasters . The brook trout is the state fish of nine U.S. states : Michigan , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Vermont , Virginia , and West Virginia , and the Provincial Fish of Nova Scotia in Canada .",

  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_horses": "Twelve U.S. states have designated a horse breed as the official state horse . The first state horse was designated in Vermont in 1961 . The most recent state designations occurred in 2010 , when North Carolina and South Carolina both declared state breeds . There have been proposals to designate a state horse in Oregon as well as in Arizona ( where an ongoing campaign sought to designate the Colonial Spanish Horse as the state horse prior to the state centennial in 2012 ) , but neither proposal is yet successful . In one state , North Dakota , the state horse is officially designated the honorary state equine . Two additional states have not designated a specific state horse , but have designed a horse or horse breed as its official state animals : the horse in New Jersey and the Morgan horse breed in Vermont . Some breeds , such as the American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan horse in Vermont and Massachusetts , were named as the state horse because of the close connection between the history of the breed and the state . Others , including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter , include the state in the official breed name . School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses , such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks , while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries . Official state horses are one of many state symbols officially designated by states . Each state has its own flag and state seal , and many states also designate other symbols , including animals , plants , and foods . Such items usually are designated because of their ties to the culture or history of that particular state .",
  "/wiki/Colonial_Spanish_Horse": "Colonial Spanish horse is a term popularized by D. Philip Sponenberg for a group of horse breed and feral populations descended from the original Iberian horse stock brought from Spain to the Americas . The ancestral type from which these horses descend was a product of the horse populations that blended between the Iberian horse and the North African Barb . The term encompasses many strains or breeds now found primarily in North America . The status of the Colonial Spanish horse is considered threatened overall with seven individual strains specifically identified . The horses are registered by several entities . The Colonial Spanish horse , a general classification , is not synonymous with the Spanish Mustang , the name given to a specific standardized breed derived from the first concerted effort of conservationists in the United States to preserve horses of Colonial Spanish Type . Colonial Spanish horse blood markers have been found in some mustang populations . Small groups of horses of Colonial Spanish horse type have been located in various groups of ranch-bred , mission , and Native American horses , mostly among those in private ownership .",

  "/wiki/Western_honey_bee": "The western honey bee or European honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) is the most common of the 7-12 species of honey bees worldwide . The genus name Apis is Latin for bee , and mellifera is the Latin for honey-bearing , referring to the species ' production of honey . Like all honey bee species , the western honey bee is eusocial , creating colonies with a single fertile female ( or queen ) , many normally non-reproductive females or workers , and a small proportion of fertile males or drones . Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees . Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals , through both pheromones and the dance language . The western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects , and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities . With human assistance , the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica . Because of its wide cultivation , this species is the single most important pollinator for agriculture globally [ citation needed ] . Western honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases , especially the Varroa mite and colony collapse disorder . As of 2019 , the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List , as numerous studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe ; however , it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies . Further research is required to enable differentiation between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild . Western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies , particularly in the fields of social evolution , learning , and memory ; they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity , to assess non-target impacts of commercial pesticides .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Gray_Squirrel": "The eastern gray squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ) , also known as the grey squirrel depending on region , is a tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus . It is native to eastern North America , where it is the most prodigious and ecologically essential natural forest regenerator . Widely introduced to certain places around the world , the eastern gray squirrel in Europe , in particular , is regarded as an invasive species .",
  "/wiki/Virginia_opossum": "The Virginia opossum ( Didelphis virginiana ) , commonly known as the North American opossum , is the only marsupial found north of Mexico . In the United States , the animal is typically referred to simply as a possum . It is a solitary and nocturnal animal about the size of a domestic cat . It is a successful opportunist . It is familiar to many North Americans as it is often seen near towns , rummaging through garbage cans .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_reptiles": "Twenty-seven U.S. states have named an official state reptile . As with other state symbols , states compare admirable aspects of the reptile and of the state , within designating statutes . Schoolchildren often start campaigns promoting their favorite reptile to encourage state legislators to enact it as a state symbol . Many secretaries of state maintain educational web pages that describe the state reptile . Oklahoma was the first state to name an official reptile , the common collared lizard , in 1969 . Only two states followed in the 1970s , but the ensuing decades saw nominations at a rate of almost one per year . State birds are more common , with all fifty states naming one , and they were adopted earlier , with the first one selected in 1927 . Before their formal designation as state reptiles , Florida 's alligator , Maryland 's terrapin , and Texas 's horned lizard were all mascots of a major in-state university . West Virginia 's timber rattlesnake was an early American flag element dating back to 1775 . Because of their cold-blooded nature , reptiles are more common in warmer climates , and nineteen of the twenty-seven state reptiles represent southern states . Six states chose a species named after the state . A turtle was chosen by more than half of the states .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_Box_Turtle": "The eastern box turtle ( Terrapene carolina carolina ) , also known as land turtle , is a subspecies within a group of hinge-shelled turtles , normally called box turtles . T. c. carolina is native to the eastern part of the United States . The eastern box turtle is a subspecies of the common box turtle ( Terrapene carolina ) . While in the pond turtle family , Emydidae , and not a tortoise , the box turtle is largely terrestrial . Box turtles are slow crawlers , extremely long lived , slow to mature , and have relatively few offspring per year . These characteristics , along with a propensity to get hit by cars and agricultural machinery , make all box turtle species particularly susceptible to anthropogenic , or human-induced , mortality . In 2011 , citing a widespread persistent and ongoing gradual decline of Terrapene carolina that probably exceeds 32% over three generations , the IUCN downgraded its conservation status from Near Threatened to Vulnerable .",

It is the only species in the genus Sciaenops . The red drum is related to the black drum ( Pogonias cromis ) , and the two species are often found near to each other ; they can interbreed and form a robust hybrid , and younger fish are often indistinguishable in flavor .",
  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_shells": "This is a list of official state shells for those states of the United States that have chosen to select one as part of their state insignia . These are seashells , the shells of various marine mollusks including both gastropod and bivalves . Each one was chosen to represent a maritime state , based on the fact that the species occurs in that state and was considered suitable to represent the state , either because of the species ' commercial importance as a local seafood item , or because of its beauty , rarity , exceptional size , or other features .",
  "/wiki/Scotch_bonnet_(sea_snail)": "The Scotch bonnet ( scientific name : Semicassis granulata ) is a medium-sized to large species of sea snail , a marine gastropod mollusk in the subfamily Cassinae , the helmet shells and bonnet shells . The common name Scotch bonnet alludes to the general outline and color pattern of the shell , which vaguely resemble a tam o ' shanter , a traditional Scottish bonnet or cap . The shell is egg-shaped and fairly large , in maximum dimension , with a regular pattern of yellow , orange or brown squarish spots . The surface sculpture of the shell is highly variable : the surface can be smooth and polished , have grooves , be granulated , or even be nodulose on the shoulder of the whorls . This species lives intertidally and subtidally on sandy substrates , and is found primarily in the tropical and subtropical Western Atlantic Ocean , from North Carolina to Uruguay . It is the most common species in this subfamily in North America . A similar-appearing sea snail in the Mediterranean Sea and Northern Atlantic Ocean , Semicassis undulata , is currently considered to be a separate species . The exact taxonomy of Semicassis granulata has been unclear in the past : as well as the current combination , 38 other combinations and synonyms exist . In the spring , the adult females of this species lay eggs in tower-shaped structures . The eggs hatch as veliger larvae , which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the seabed as tiny snails . Crabs are a predator of this sea snail . After the death of the snails , if the shells are still intact they are often used by hermit crabs ."
