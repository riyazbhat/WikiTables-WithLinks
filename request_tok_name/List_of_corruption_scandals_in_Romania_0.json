  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",
  "/wiki/Forgery": "Forgery is a white-collar crime that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a legal instrument with the specific intent to defraud anyone ( other than themself ) . Tampering with a certain legal instrument may be forbidden by law in some jurisdictions but such an offense is not related to forgery unless the tampered legal instrument was actually used in the course of the crime to defraud another person or entity . Copies , studio replicas , and reproductions are not considered forgeries , though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful misrepresentations . Forging money or currency is more often called counterfeiting . But consumer goods may also be counterfeits if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the label or flagged by the trademark symbol . When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a false document . This usage of forgery does not derive from metalwork done at a blacksmith 's forge , but it has a parallel history . A sense of to counterfeit is already in the Anglo-French verb forger , meaning falsify . A forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object . Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself - what it is worth or what it proves - than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others , then the larger process is a hoax . In a hoax , a rumor or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation , may substitute for a forged physical object . The similar crime of fraud is the crime of deceiving another , including through the use of objects obtained through forgery .",

  "/wiki/Conflict_of_interest": "A conflict of interest ( COI ) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests , financial or otherwise , and serving one interest could involve working against another . Typically , this relates to situations in which the personal interest of an individual or organization might adversely affect a duty owed to make decisions for the benefit of a third party . An interest is a commitment , obligation , duty or goal associated with a particular social role or practice . By definition , a conflict of interest occurs if , within a particular decision-making context , an individual is subject to two coexisting interests that are in direct conflict with each other . Such a matter is of importance because under such circumstances the decision-making process can be disrupted or compromised in a manner that affects the integrity or the reliability of the outcomes . Typically , a conflict of interest arises when an individual finds himself or herself occupying two social roles simultaneously which generate opposing benefits or loyalties . The interests involved can be pecuniary or non-pecuniary . The existence of such conflicts is an objective fact , not a state of mind , and does not in itself indicate any lapse or moral error . However , especially where a decision is being taken in a fiduciary context , it is important that the contending interests be clearly identified and the process for separating them is rigorously established . Typically , this will involve the conflicted individual either giving up one of the conflicting roles or else recusing himself or herself from the particular decision-making process that is in question . The presence of a conflict of interest is independent of the occurrence of Inappropriateness . Therefore , a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any corruption occurs .",
