As a representative of the seventeenth-century tradition of rationalism , Leibniz 's most prominent accomplishment was conceiving the ideas of differential and integral calculus , independently of Isaac Newton 's contemporaneous developments . Mathematical works have consistently favored Leibniz 's notation as the conventional expression of calculus . It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz 's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation ( by means of non-standard analysis ) . He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators . While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal 's calculator , he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel , used in the arithmometer , the first mass-produced mechanical calculator . He also refined the binary number system , which is the foundation of all digital computers . In philosophy , Leibniz is most noted for his optimism , i.e . his conclusion that our universe is , in a restricted sense , the best possible one that God could have created , an idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire . Leibniz , along with Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Baruch Spinoza , was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism . The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy , but his philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition , notably that conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence .",

  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",

Lincoln led the nation through its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis in the American Civil War . He preserved the Union , abolished slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the U.S. economy . Lincoln was born in poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the frontier primarily in Indiana . He was self-educated and became a lawyer , Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator , and U.S . Congressman from Illinois . In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act . He reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new Republican Party and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas . Lincoln ran for President in 1860 , sweeping the North in victory . Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North 's rejection of their right to practice slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union . To secure its independence , the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in the South , and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union . As the leader of moderate Republicans , Lincoln found his political opposition was manifold , and included Radical Republicans , War Democrats , Copperheads ( anti-war Democrats ) , and irreconcilable secessionists .",

[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union .

  "/wiki/National_Hockey_League": "The National Hockey League ( NHL ; French : Ligue nationale de hockey - LNH ) is a professional ice hockey league in North America , currently comprising 31 teams : 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada . The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada . The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season . The National Hockey League was organized on November 26 , 1917 , at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew , Ontario . The NHL immediately took the NHA 's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926 . At its inception , the NHL had four teams - all in Canada , thus the adjective National in the league 's name . The league expanded to the United States in 1924 , when the Boston Bruins joined , and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams . From 1942 to 1967 , the league had only six teams , collectively ( if not contemporaneously ) nicknamed the Original Six . The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion . The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979 . Between 1991 and 2000 , the NHL further expanded to 30 teams . It added its 31st team in 2017 and has approved the addition of a 32nd team in 2021 .",

He was the 14th prime minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968 , as the head of two back-to-back Liberal minority governments following elections in 1963 and 1965 . During Pearson 's time as prime minister , his Liberal minority governments introduced universal health care , student loans , the Canada Pension Plan , the Order of Canada , and the Maple Leaf flag . His Liberal government also unified Canada 's armed forces . Pearson convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism , and he kept Canada out of the Vietnam War . In 1967 , his government passed Bill C-168 , which de facto abolished capital punishment in Canada by restricting it to a few capital offences for which it was never used , and which themselves were abolished in 1976 . With these accomplishments , together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy , Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian prime ministers .",

  "/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Lipton_Trophy": "The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy was an association football competition that took place twice , in Turin , Italy , in 1909 and 1911 . It is regarded by some as The First World Cup . It is predated by the Torneo Internazionale Stampa Sportiva , which was hosted in 1908 in Turin . Also seen as an international competition , but with the noted lack of an England team , Lipton in partnership with the Italian royal family , wanted to go one further and make a more complete tournament . Of course the actual World Cup features international teams from around the world , but the Lipton Cup , an invitational , only featured a few club sides from Europe . Italy , Germany and Switzerland sent their most prestigious club sides to the competition , but The Football Association of England refused to be associated with it and declined the offer to send a team . Not wishing to have England unrepresented in the competition , Lipton invited West Auckland FC , an amateur side from County Durham and mostly made up of coal miners , to take part . Some sources claim that this was as a result of an administrative error as the FA intended to send Woolwich Arsenal but West Auckland were invited instead as they shared the same initials . However , the most recent research shows that West Auckland were always the expected team . The latest book on the subject The Miners ' Triumph by Martin Connolly , gives the fullest account yet as to the West Auckland Victory and the players involved . West Auckland won the tournament and returned to Italy in 1911 to defend their title . In this second competition , West Auckland beat the then amateur team Juventus 6-1 in the final , and were awarded the trophy outright .",
