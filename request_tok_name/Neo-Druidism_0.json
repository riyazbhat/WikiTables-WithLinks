  "/wiki/Samhain": "Samhain ( /\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0w\u026an , \u02c8sa\u028a\u026an/ ; Irish : [ \u02c8s\u02e0\u0259u\u026an\u02b2 ] Scottish Gaelic : [ \u02c8s\u032a\u00e3\u0169.\u026a\u0272 ] ) is a Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the darker half of the year . Traditionally , it is celebrated from 31 October to 1 November , as the Celtic day began and ended at sunset . This is about halfway between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice . It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals , along with Imbolc , Bealtaine and Lughnasadh . Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . Similar festivals are held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands , for example the Brittonic Calan Gaeaf ( in Wales ) , Kalan Gwav ( in Cornwall ) , and Kalan Goa\u00f1v ( in Brittany ) ; both Celtic branches are roughly as old as each other . Samhain is believed to have Celtic pagan origins and there is evidence it has been an important date since ancient times . Some Neolithic passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the time of Samhain . It is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and many important events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain . It was the time when cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and when livestock were slaughtered for the winter . As at Bealtaine , special bonfires were lit , which were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers , and there were rituals involving them . Like Bealtaine , Samhain was seen as a liminal time , when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed .",
  "/wiki/Calan_Gaeaf": "Calan Gaeaf is the name of the first day of winter in Wales , observed on 1 November . The night before is Nos Galan Gaeaf or Noson Galan Gaeaf , an Ysbrydnos when spirits are abroad . Traditionally , people avoid churchyards , stiles , and crossroads , since spirits are thought to gather there .",
  "/wiki/Celtic_polytheism": "Ancient Celtic religion , commonly known as Celtic paganism , comprises the religious beliefs and practices adhered to by the Iron Age people of Western Europe now known as the Celts , roughly between 500 BCE and 500 CE , spanning the La T\u00e8ne period and the Roman era , and in the case of the Insular Celts the British and Irish Iron Age . Very little is known with any certainty about the subject , and apart from documented names that are thought to be of deities , the only detailed contemporary accounts are by hostile and probably not-well-informed Roman writers .",
  "/wiki/Celts": "The Celts ( /k\u025blts , s\u025blts/ , see pronunciation of Celt for different usages ) are a collection of Indo-European peoples of Europe identified by their use of the Celtic languages and other cultural similarities . The history of pre-Celtic Europe and the exact relationship between ethnic , linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial . The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto-Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to another theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800-450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . It is thus that this area is sometimes called the Celtic homeland . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans-cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern-day Turkey . The earliest undisputed direct examples of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions beginning in the 6th century BC . Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names . Insular Celtic languages are attested beginning around the 4th century in Ogham inscriptions , although they were clearly being spoken much earlier . Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD . Coherent texts of Early Irish literature , such as the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge ( Cattle Raid of Cooley ) , survive in 12th-century recensions .",
  "/wiki/Winter_Solstice": "The winter solstice , hiemal solstice or hibernal solstice , also known as midwinter , occurs when one of the Earth 's poles has its maximum tilt away from the Sun . It happens twice yearly , once in each hemisphere ( Northern and Southern ) . For that hemisphere , the winter solstice is the day with the shortest period of daylight and longest night of the year , when the Sun is at its lowest daily maximum elevation in the sky . At the pole , there is continuous darkness or twilight around the winter solstice . Its opposite is the summer solstice . The winter solstice occurs during the hemisphere 's winter . In the Northern Hemisphere , this is the December solstice ( usually 21 or 22 December ) and in the Southern Hemisphere , this is the June solstice ( usually 20 or 21 June ) . Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment , the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs . Other names are midwinter , the extreme of winter ( Dongzhi ) , or the shortest day . Traditionally , in many temperate regions , the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter , but today in some countries and calendars , it is seen as the beginning of winter . In meteorology , winter is reckoned as beginning about three weeks before the winter solstice . Since prehistory , the winter solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures , and has been marked by festivals and rituals .",
  "/wiki/Germanic_paganism": "Germanic paganism refers to the ethnic religion practiced by the Germanic peoples from the Iron Age until Christianisation during the Middle Ages . It was an essential element of early Germanic culture . From both archaeological remains and literary sources , it is possible to trace a number of common or closely related beliefs amid the Germanic peoples into the Middle Ages , when the last areas in Scandinavia were Christianized . Rooted in Proto-Indo-European religion , Proto-Germanic religion expanded during the Migration Period , yielding extensions such as Old Norse religion among the North Germanic peoples , the paganism practiced amid the continental Germanic peoples , and Anglo-Saxon paganism among the Old English-speaking peoples . Germanic religion is best documented in several texts from the 10th and 11th centuries , where they have been best preserved in Scandinavia and Iceland .",
  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73% ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25% ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",
  "/wiki/Imbolc": "Imbolc or Imbolg ( [ \u026a\u02c8m\u02e0\u0254l\u02e0\u0261 ] ) , also called ( Saint ) Brigid 's Day ( Irish : L\u00e1 Fh\u00e9ile Br\u00edde , Scottish Gaelic : L\u00e0 Fh\u00e8ill Br\u00ecghde , Manx : Laa ' l Breeshey ) , is a Gaelic traditional festival marking the beginning of spring . It is held on 1 February , or about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox . Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals - along with Beltane , Lughnasadh and Samhain . For Christians , especially in Ireland , it is the feast day of Saint Brigid . Imbolc is mentioned in early Irish literature , and there is evidence suggesting it was also an important date in ancient times . It is believed that Imbolc was originally a pagan festival associated with the goddess Brigid , and that it was Christianized as a festival of Saint Brigid , who is thought to be a Christianization of the goddess . On Imbolc/St Brigid 's Day , Brigid 's crosses were made and a doll-like figure of Brigid ( a Br\u00edde\u00f3g ) would be paraded from house-to-house by girls , sometimes accompanied by 'strawboys ' . Brigid was said to visit one 's home at Imbolc . To receive her blessings , people would make a bed for Brigid and leave her food and drink , and items of clothing would be left outside for her to bless . Brigid was also invoked to protect homes and livestock . Special feasts were had , holy wells were visited , and it was a time for divination .",
  "/wiki/Spring_Equinox": "The March equinox or Northward equinox is the equinox on the Earth when the subsolar point appears to leave the Southern Hemisphere and cross the celestial equator , heading northward as seen from Earth . The March equinox is known as the vernal equinox ( spring equinox ) in the Northern Hemisphere and as the autumnal equinox in the Southern . On the Gregorian calendar , the Northward equinox can occur as early as 19 March or as late as 21 March at Greenwich . For a common year the computed time slippage is about 5 hours 49 minutes later than the previous year , and for a leap year about 18 hours 11 minutes earlier than the previous year . Balancing the increases of the common years against the losses of the leap years keeps the calendar date of the March equinox from drifting more than one day from 20 March each year . The March equinox may be taken to mark the beginning of spring and the end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere but marks the beginning of autumn and the end of summer in the Southern Hemisphere . In astronomy , the March equinox is the zero point of sidereal time and , consequently , right ascension . It also serves as a reference for calendars and celebrations in many human cultures and religions .",
  "/wiki/Beltaine": "Beltane or Beltain ( /\u02c8b\u025bl.te\u026an/ ) is the Gaelic May Day festival . Most commonly it is held on 1 May , or about halfway between the spring equinox and the summer solstice . Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . In Irish the name for the festival day is L\u00e1 Bealtaine ( [ l\u032a\u02e0a\u02d0 \u02c8b\u02b2al\u032a\u02e0t\u032a\u02e0\u0259n\u02b2\u0259 ] ) , in Scottish Gaelic L\u00e0 Bealltainn ( [ l\u032a\u02e0a\u02d0 \u02c8pjaul\u032a\u02e0t\u032a\u026a\u0272 ] ) and in Manx Gaelic Laa Boaltinn/Boaldyn . It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals - along with Samhain , Imbolc and Lughnasadh - and is similar to the Welsh Calan Mai . Beltane is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and is associated with important events in Irish mythology . Also known as C\u00e9tshamhain ( first of summer ) , it marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures . Rituals were performed to protect the cattle , crops and people , and to encourage growth . Special bonfires were kindled , and their flames , smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers . The people and their cattle would walk around or between bonfires , and sometimes leap over the flames or embers . All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire . These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast , and some of the food and drink would be offered to the aos s\u00ed .",
  "/wiki/Calan_Mai": "Calan Mai ( [ \u02c8kalan \u02c8ma\u026a\u032f ] Calend ( first day ) of May ) or Calan Haf ( [ \u02c8kalan \u02c8ha\u02d0v ] Calend of Summer ) is a May Day holiday of Wales held on 1 May . Celebrations start on the evening before , known as May Eve , with bonfires ; as with Calan Gaeaf or November 1 , the night before ( Welsh : Nos Galan Haf ) is considered an Ysbrydnos or spirit night when spirits are out and about divination is possible . The tradition of lighting bonfires celebrating this occasion happened annually in South Wales until the middle of the 19th century . Calan Haf parallels Beltane and other May Day traditions in Europe .",
  "/wiki/Summer_Solstice": "The summer solstice ( or estival solstice ) , also known as midsummer , occurs when one of the Earth 's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun . It happens twice yearly , once in each hemisphere ( Northern and Southern ) . For that hemisphere , the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky and is the day with the longest period of daylight . Within the Arctic circle ( for the northern hemisphere ) or Antarctic circle ( for the southern hemisphere ) , there is continuous daylight around the summer solstice . On the summer solstice , Earth 's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44\u00b0 . Likewise , the Sun 's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44\u00b0 . The summer solstice occurs during summer . This is the June solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the December solstice in the Southern Hemisphere . Depending on the shift of the calendar , the summer solstice occurs sometime between June 20 and June 22 in the Northern Hemisphere and between December 20 and December 23 in the Southern Hemisphere . The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the winter solstice . Since prehistory , the summer solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures , and has been marked by festivals and rituals . Traditionally , in many temperate regions ( especially Europe ) , the summer solstice is seen as the middle of summer and referred to as midsummer .",
  "/wiki/Lughnasadh": "Lughnasadh or Lughnasa ( /\u02c8lu\u02d0n\u0259s\u0259/ LOO-n\u0259-s\u0259 ) is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of the harvest season . Historically , it was widely observed throughout Ireland , Scotland and the Isle of Man . In Modern Irish it is called L\u00fanasa , in Scottish Gaelic : L\u00f9nastal , and in Manx : Luanistyn . Traditionally it is held on 1 August , or about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox . However , in recent centuries some of the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date . Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals , along with Samhain , Imbolc and Beltane . It corresponds to other European harvest festivals such as the Welsh G\u0175yl Awst and the English Lammas . Lughnasadh is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and has pagan origins . The festival itself is named after the god Lugh . It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies , ritual athletic contests ( most notably the Tailteann Games ) , feasting , matchmaking and trading . There were also visits to holy wells . According to folklorist M\u00e1ire MacNeill , evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the 'First Fruits ' , a feast of the new food and of bilberries , the sacrifice of a bull and a ritual dance-play in which Lugh seizes the harvest for mankind and defeats the powers of blight .",
  "/wiki/Autumn_Equinox": "The September equinox ( or Southward equinox ) is the moment when the Sun appears to cross the celestial equator , heading southward . Due to differences between the calendar year and the tropical year , the September equinox can occur at any time between September 21 and 24 . At the equinox , the Sun as viewed from the equator rises due east and sets due west . Before the Southward equinox , the Sun rises and sets more northerly , and afterwards , it rises and sets more southerly . The equinox may be taken to mark the end of summer and the beginning of autumn ( autumnal equinox ) in the Northern Hemisphere , while marking the end of winter and the start of spring ( vernal equinox ) in the Southern Hemisphere ."
