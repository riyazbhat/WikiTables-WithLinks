The American 's legal predecessor , the original Big East Conference , was considered one of the six collegiate power conferences of the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) era in college football , and The American inherited that status in the BCS 's final season . With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014 , The American became a Group of Five conference , which shares one automatic spot in the New Year 's Six bowl games . [ note 3 ] The league is the product of substantial turmoil in the old Big East during the 2010-14 conference realignment period . It is one of two conferences to emerge from the all-sports Big East in 2013 . While the other successor , which does not sponsor football , purchased the Big East Conference name , The American inherited the old Big East 's structure and is that conference 's legal successor . However , both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date , and the same history up to 2013 .
