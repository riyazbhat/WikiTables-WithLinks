  "/wiki/Carbon_dioxide": "Carbon dioxide ( chemical formula CO2 ) is a colorless gas with a density about 60% higher than that of dry air . Carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms . It occurs naturally in Earth 's atmosphere as a trace gas . The current concentration is about 0.04% ( 410 ppm ) by volume , having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm . Natural sources include volcanoes , hot springs and geysers , and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids . Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water , it occurs naturally in groundwater , rivers and lakes , ice caps , glaciers and seawater . It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas . Carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations , but at high concentrations , it has a sharp and acidic odor . At such concentrations it generates the taste of soda water in the mouth . As the source of available carbon in the carbon cycle , atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on Earth and its concentration in Earth 's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian has been regulated by photosynthetic organisms and geological phenomena . Plants , algae and cyanobacteria use light energy to photosynthesize carbohydrate from carbon dioxide and water , with oxygen produced as a waste product . CO2 is produced by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize carbohydrates and lipids to produce energy by respiration .",
