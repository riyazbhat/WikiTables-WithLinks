The removal of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago occurred between 1968 and 1973 . The Chagossians , then numbering about 2,000 people , were expelled by the British government to Mauritius and Seychelles to allow the United States to build a joint UK/US military base there . Today , the exiled Chagossians are still trying to return , arguing that the forced expulsion and dispossession was illegal . The islands are off-limits to Chagossians , casual tourists , and the media . Since the 1980s the government of Mauritius has sought to regain control over the Chagos Archipelago , which was separated from the British Colony of Mauritius by the UK in 1965 to form the British Indian Ocean Territory . On 23 June 2017 , the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) voted in favour of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK to the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean .

  "/wiki/English_language": "English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states .",

It was one of the Dependencies of the British Colony of Mauritius until the Chagos Islands were detached for inclusion in the newly created British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) in 1965 . In 1966 , the population of the island was 924. : par 23 These people were employed as contract farm workers on coconut plantations owned by the Chagos-Agalega company . Although it was common for local plantation managers to allow pensioners and the disabled to remain in the islands and continue to receive housing and rations in exchange for light work , children after the age of 12 were required to work . In 1964 , only 3 of a population of 963 were unemployed . In April 1967 , the BIOT Administration bought out Chagos-Agalega for \u00a3600,000 , thus becoming the sole property owner in the BIOT . The Crown immediately leased back the properties to Chagos-Agalega but the company terminated the lease at the end of 1967 . Between 1968 and 1973 , the now unemployed farm workers were forcibly removed from Diego Garcia by the UK Government so a joint US/UK military base could be established on the island . Many were deported to Mauritius and the Seychelles , following which the United States built a large naval and military base , which has been in continuous operation since then . As of August 2018 [ update ] , Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island of the BIOT ; the population is composed of military personnel and supporting contractors .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

The territory 's dual name ( official since the islands incorporation into Australia in 1955 ) reflects that the islands have historically been known as either the Cocos Islands or the Keeling Islands . The territory consists of two atolls made up of 27 coral islands , of which only two - West Island and Home Island - are inhabited . The population of around 600 people consists mainly of Cocos Malays , who mostly practise Sunni Islam and speak a dialect of Malay as their first language . The territory is administered by the Australian federal government 's Department of Infrastructure , Regional Development and Cities , and together with Christmas Island ( which is about 960 kilometres ( 600 mi ) to the east ) forms the Australian Indian Ocean Territories administrative unit . However , the islanders do have a degree of self-government through the local shire council . Many public services - including health , education , and policing - are provided by the state of Western Australia , and Western Australian law applies except where the federal government has determined otherwise . The islands were first discovered in 1609 by William Keeling , but no settlement occurred until the early 19th century . One of the first settlers was John Clunies-Ross , a Scottish merchant ; much of the island 's current population is descended from the Malay workers he brought in to work his copra plantation . The Clunies-Ross family ruled the islands as a private fiefdom for almost 150 years , with the head of the family usually recognised as resident magistrate .

Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian .

With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century .

  "/wiki/Crown_Dependencies": "The Crown dependencies ( French : D\u00e9pendances de la Couronne ; Manx : Croghaneyn-crooin ) are three island territories off the coast of Great Britain that are self-governing possessions of the Crown : the Bailiwick of Guernsey , the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Isle of Man . They do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories . Internationally , the dependencies are considered territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible , rather than sovereign states . As a result , they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations . However , they do have relationships with the Commonwealth , the European Union , and other international organisations , and are members of the British-Irish Council . They have their own teams in the Commonwealth Games . They are not part of the European Union ( EU ) , although they are within the EU 's customs area . The Isle of Man ( along with the United Kingdom ) is within the EU 's VAT area . As the Crown dependencies are not sovereign states , the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with the government of the United Kingdom ( though this is rarely done without the consent of the dependencies , and the right to do so is disputed ) . However they each have their own legislative assembly , with the power to legislate on many local matters with the assent of the Crown ( Privy Council , or in the case of the Isle of Man in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor ) . In each case , the head of government is referred to as the Chief Minister .",
  "/wiki/The_Crown": "The Crown is the state in all its aspects within the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth realms and their sub-divisions ( such as Crown dependencies , provinces , or states ) . Legally ill-defined , the term has different meanings depending on context . It is used to designate the monarch in either a personal capacity , as Head of the Commonwealth , or as the king or queen of his or her realms . It can also refer to the rule of law ; however , in common parlance 'The Crown ' refers to the functions of government and the civil service . A corporation sole , the Crown is the legal embodiment of executive , legislative , and judicial governance in the monarchy of each country . These monarchies are united by the personal union of their monarch , but they are independent states . The concept of the Crown developed first in England as a separation of the literal crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch . It spread through English and later British colonisation and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the United Kingdom , its Crown dependencies , and the other 15 independent realms . It is not to be confused with any physical crown , such as those of the British regalia . The term is also found in various expressions such as Crown land , which some countries refer to as public land or state land ; as well as in some offices , such as minister of the Crown , Crown attorney , and Crown prosecutor .",
  "/wiki/United_Kingdom": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , commonly known as the United Kingdom ( UK or U.K. ) or Britain , [ note 11 ] is a sovereign country located off the north\u00adwestern coast of the European mainland . Existing under its current name since 1921 , the United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain , the north\u00adeastern part of the island of Ireland , and many smaller islands . Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland . Otherwise , the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea to the east , the English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea to the southwest , giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world . The Irish Sea separates Great Britain and Ireland . The total area of the United Kingdom is 94,000 square miles ( 240,000 km2 ) . The United Kingdom is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy .

  "/wiki/Guern\u00e9siais": "Guern\u00e9siais , also known as Dg\u00e8rn\u00e9siais , Guernsey French , and Guernsey Norman French , is the variety of the Norman language spoken in Guernsey . It is sometimes known on the island simply as patois . As one of the langues d'o\u00efl , it has its roots in Latin , but has had strong influence from both Old Norse and English at different points in its history . There is mutual intelligibility ( with some difficulty ) with J\u00e8rriais speakers from Jersey and Continental Norman speakers from Normandy . Guern\u00e9siais most closely resembles the Norman dialect of Cotentinais spoken in La Hague in the Cotentin Peninsula of France . Guern\u00e9siais has been influenced less by Standard French than J\u00e8rriais , but conversely more so by English . New words have been imported for modern phenomena : e.g . le bike and le gas-cooker . There is a rich tradition of poetry in the Guernsey language . Guernsey songs were inspired by the sea , by colourful figures of speech , by traditional folk-lore , as well as by the natural environment of the island . The island 's greatest poet was George M\u00e9tivier ( 1790-1881 ) , a contemporary of Victor Hugo , who influenced and inspired local poets to print and publish their traditional poetry . M\u00e9tivier blended local place-names , bird and animal names , traditional sayings and orally transmitted fragments of medieval poetry to create his Rimes Guernesiaises ( 1831 ) .",
  "/wiki/Saint_Peter_Port": "Saint Peter Port is the capital of Guernsey as well as the main port . The population in 2014 was 18,207 . In Guern\u00e9siais and in French , historically the official language of Guernsey , the name of the town and its surrounding parish is St Pierre Port . The port distinguishes this parish from Saint Pierre Du Bois . As well as being a parish , St. Peter Port is a small town consisting mostly of steep narrow streets and steps on the overlooking slopes . It is known that a trading post/town existed here before Roman times with a pre-Christian name which has not survived . The postal code for addresses in this parish starts with GY1 . People from St. Peter Port , were nicknamed les Villais ( the townspeople ) or cllichards in Guern\u00e9siais .",
  "/wiki/Isle_of_Man": "The Isle of Man ( Manx : Mannin [ \u02c8man\u026an\u02b2 ] , also Manx : Ellan Vannin [ \u02c8\u025bl\u02b2an \u02c8van\u026an\u02b2 ] ) , sometimes referred to simply as Mann /m\u00e6n/ , is a self-governing British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland . The head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a lieutenant governor . Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom . Humans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC . Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century AD , and the Manx language , a branch of the Gaelic languages , emerged . In 627 Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia . In the 9th century , Norsemen established the Kingdom of the Isles , which included the Isle of Man . Magnus III , King of Norway from 1093 to 1103 , reigned also as King of Mann and the Isles between 1099 and 1103 . In 1266 the island became part of Scotland under the Treaty of Perth , after being ruled by Norway . After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England , the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399 . The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765 , but the island never became part of the 18th century kingdom of Great Britain or its successors ( the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the present-day United Kingdom ) . It retained its internal self-government .",
  "/wiki/Manx_language": "Manx ( native name Gaelg or Gailck , pronounced [ \u0261il\u0261 ] or [ \u0261ilk ] or [ \u0261e\u02d0l\u0261 ] ) , also known as Manx Gaelic , and also historically spelled Manks , is a member of the Goidelic ( Gaelic ) language branch of the Celtic languages of the Indo-European language family ; it was spoken as a first language by some of the Manx people on the Isle of Man until the death of the last native speaker , Ned Maddrell , in 1974 . Despite this , the language has never fallen completely out of use , with a minority having some knowledge of it ; in addition , Manx still has a role as an important part of the island 's culture and heritage . Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts ; in 2015 , around 1,800 people had varying levels of second language conversational ability . Since the late 20th century , Manx has become more visible on the island , with increased signage , radio broadcasts and a Manx-medium primary school . The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded : for example , the Bible had been translated into Manx , and audio recordings had been made of native speakers .",
  "/wiki/Douglas,_Isle_of_Man": "Douglas ( Manx : Doolish ) is the capital and largest town of the Isle of Man , with a population of 27,938 ( 2011 ) . It is located at the mouth of the River Douglas , and on a sweeping bay of two miles . The River Douglas forms part of the town 's harbour and main commercial port . Douglas was a small settlement until it grew rapidly as a result of links with the English port of Liverpool in the 18th century . Further population growth came in the following century , resulting during the 1860s in a staged transfer of the High Courts , the Lieutenant Governor 's residence , and finally the seat of the legislature , Tynwald , to Douglas from the ancient capital , Castletown . The town is the Island 's main hub for business , finance , legal services , shipping , transport , shopping , and entertainment . The annual Isle of Man TT motorcycle races start and finish in Douglas .",
  "/wiki/Jersey": "Jersey ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u025c\u02d0rzi/ JUR-zee , French : [ \u0292\u025b\u0281z\u025b ] ( listen ) ; J\u00e8rriais : J\u00e8rri [ d\u0292\u025bri ] ) , officially the Bailiwick of Jersey ( French : Bailliage de Jersey ; J\u00e8rriais : Bailliage d\u00e9 J\u00e8rri ) , is a British Crown dependency located near the coast of Normandy , France . It is the second-closest of the Channel Islands to France , after Alderney . Jersey was part of the Duchy of Normandy , whose dukes went on to become kings of England from 1066 . After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the 13th century , and the ducal title surrendered to France , Jersey and the other Channel Islands remained attached to the English crown . The bailiwick consists of the island of Jersey , the largest of the Channel Islands , along with surrounding uninhabited islands and rocks collectively named Les Dirouilles , Les \u00c9cr\u00e9hous , Les Minquiers , Les Pierres de Lecq , and other reefs . Although the bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are often referred to collectively as the Channel Islands , the Channel Islands are not a constitutional or political unit . Jersey has a separate relationship to the Crown from the other Crown dependencies of Guernsey and the Isle of Man , although all are held by the monarch of the United Kingdom . Jersey is a self-governing parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy , with its own financial , legal and judicial systems , and the power of self-determination . The Lieutenant Governor on the island is the personal representative of the Queen . Jersey is not part of the United Kingdom , and has an international identity separate from that of the UK , but the UK is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey . The definition of United Kingdom in the British Nationality Act 1981 is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together.The European Commission confirmed in a written reply to the European Parliament in 2003 that Jersey was within the Union as a European Territory for whose external relationships the UK is responsible . Jersey was not fully part of the European Union but had a special relationship with it , notably being treated as within the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods .",
  "/wiki/J\u00e8rriais": "J\u00e8rriais is the form of the Norman language spoken in Jersey , one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France . It has been in decline over the past century as English has increasingly become the language of education , commerce and administration . There are very few people who speak J\u00e8rriais as a mother tongue and , owing to the age of the remaining speakers , their numbers decrease annually . Despite this , efforts are being made to keep the language alive . A similar language , Guern\u00e9siais , is spoken in neighbouring Guernsey . The language of Sark , Sercquiais , is a descendant of the J\u00e8rriais brought by the Jersey colonists who settled Sark in the 16th century ; and there is mutual intelligibility with the Norman language of mainland Normandy . J\u00e8rriais is often called Jersey French or Jersey Norman French in English ( though this may give the impression that the language is a dialect of French ) and jersiais or normand de Jersey in French . J\u00e8rriais is distinct from the Jersey Legal French used for legal contracts , laws and official documents by the government and administration of Jersey . For this reason , some prefer using the term Jersey Norman to avoid ambiguity and to dissociate the language from standard French .",

St Helier has a population of about 33,500 , roughly 34.2% of the total population of Jersey , and is the capital of the Island ( although Government House is situated in St Saviour ) . The urban area of the parish of St Helier makes up most of the largest town in Jersey , although some of the town area is situated in adjacent St Saviour , with suburbs sprawling into St Lawrence and St Clement . The greater part of St Helier is rural . The parish covers a surface area of 4.1 square miles ( 10.6 km2 ) , being 9% of the total land area of the Island ( this includes reclaimed land area of 494 acres ( 2.00 km2 ) or 200 ha ) . The parish arms are two crossed gold axes on a blue background , the blue symbolising the sea , and the axes symbolising the martyrdom of Helier at the hands of Saxon pirates in 555 AD ."
