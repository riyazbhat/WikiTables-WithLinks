  "/wiki/Mercy_rule": "A mercy rule , slaughter rule , knockout rule , or skunk rule ends a two-competitor sports competition earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable scoring lead over the other . It is called the mercy rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser . It is common in youth sports in North America , where running up the score is considered unsporting . It is especially common in baseball and softball in which there is no game clock and a dominant team could in theory continue an inning endlessly . The rules vary widely , depending on the level of competition , but nearly all youth sports leagues and high school sports associations and many college sports associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball , softball , American football and association football . However , mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game ( like the second half of an association football game ) . Thus , one team , particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent , can still run up the score before the rule takes effect . For instance , in American football , one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half ; in baseball , the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning , but the game would still continue .",

  "/wiki/Perth": "Perth ( /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0r\u03b8/ ( listen ) PURTH ) is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia ( WA ) . It is named after the city of Perth , Scotland and is Australia 's fourth-most populous city , with a population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia .",

  "/wiki/Extra_innings": "Extra innings is the extension of a baseball or softball game in order to break a tie . Ordinarily , a baseball game consists of nine regulation innings ( in softball and high school baseball games there are typically seven innings ; in Little League Baseball , six ) , each of which is divided into halves : the visiting team bats first , after which the home team takes its turn at bat . However , if the score remains tied at the end of the regulation number of complete innings , the rules provide that play shall continue until ( 1 ) the visiting team has scored more total runs than the home team at the end of a completed inning ; or ( 2 ) the home team scores the winning run in an uncompleted inning . ( Since the home team bats second , condition ( 2 ) does not allow the visiting team to score more runs before the end of the inning ) . The rules of the game , including the batting order , availability of substitute players and pitchers , etc. , remain intact in extra innings . Managers must display caution to avoid exhausting all their substitute players during regular innings , in case the game reaches extensive extra innings .
