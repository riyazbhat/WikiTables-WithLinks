  "/wiki/Washes_Whiter_Than": "Washes Whiter Than is the third studio album by the Christian rock band Petra . It was released in 1979 amidst major line-up changes that saw all but one of the founding band members leave . The album features a more mellow style when compared to the band 's two previous efforts . Part of the reason for this is that the group wanted to get away from the controversy surrounding the hard rock style of their earlier releases . The softer material on this record achieved greater airplay on Christian radio stations than had their previous albums . This is also the first release to feature singer Greg X. Volz as an official band member . Musician Rob Frazier , who later went on to have a solo career , is also featured as lead vocalist in several of the songs , as well as playing most of the instrumentation together with founder Bob Hartman . The album was reissued by Star Song Records on a 2-on-1 CD package together with 1981 's Never Say Die . The songs ( Could n't Find Love ) Without You and Magic Words were cut from this edition to save space .",
