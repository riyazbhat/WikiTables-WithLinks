Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869-1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . A. Lawrence Lowell , who succeeded Eliot , further reformed the undergraduate curriculum and undertook aggressive expansion of Harvard 's land holdings and physical campus . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II ; he began to liberalize admissions after the war . The university is organized into eleven principal academic units - ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study - with campuses throughout Greater Boston : its 209-acre ( 85 ha ) original undergraduate campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , approximately 3 miles ( 5 km ) northwest of Boston ; the business school and many athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston ; and the medical , dental , and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area .
