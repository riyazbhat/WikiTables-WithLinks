Part of the Six Flags Houston complex , the park also included Six Flags WaterWorld , a water park that was adjacent to the main park . The park opened on June 1 , 1968 , and was originally developed and constructed as part of the Astrodomain , the brainchild of local philanthropist and former Houston mayor Judge Roy Hofheinz , who intended it to complement The Astrodome . AstroWorld was sold to the Six Flags Corporation by the Hofheinz family in 1975 . Although it was the fourth theme park to be included in the Six Flags family , it was the first to be acquired by that company rather than built from the ground up . Initially , it was marketed as AstroWorld : A Member of the Six Flags Family so as to not confuse patrons with Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington . AstroWorld was permanently closed by Six Flags , Inc. after its final day of operations on October 30 , 2005 , the final night of Fright Fest 2005 .

Katrina originated on August 23 , 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten . Early the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25 . After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . Over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans , Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina . Eventually , 80% of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , were inundated for weeks . The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans ' transportation and communication facilities , leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 . The emergency response from federal , state and local governments was widely criticized , resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department ( NOPD ) Superintendent Eddie Compass .",
