  "/wiki/CFEG-TV": "CFEG-TV , UHF analog channel 19 , is a low-power Christian television station licensed to Abbotsford , British Columbia , Canada . The station is owned by the Clearbrook Mennonite Brethren Church . It is presently not carried on any cable providers . The station was created mainly because many senior citizens , who make up a large portion of the church 's congregation , are unable to attend services in person , thus a broadcast television station would give them the opportunity to watch those services on television . Clearbrook Mennonite Brethren Church was granted a licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) to operate a low-power UHF television transmitter in the spring of 1999 . After the station and its transmitter were set up and tested , CFEG went on the air for the first time in July 2000 . The station 's antenna is mounted on the roof of the church . CFEG 's programming consists of the church 's English and German Sunday morning and evening services as well as its Wednesday morning German Bible study . Other programs which keep with the church 's mission may be added in the future , although they must be locally produced , since the station is not allowed to air programs produced by other stations . All of CFEG 's operating costs are paid for by the church . As part of the conditions of its licence , the station is not permitted to air advertising .",
  "/wiki/Independent_station_(North_America)": "An independent station is a type of television station broadcasting in the United States or Canada that is not affiliated with any broadcast television network ; most commonly , these stations carry a mix of syndicated , brokered and in some cases , local programming to fill time periods when network programs typically would air . Stations that are affiliated with networks such as The CW , MyNetworkTV or to a lesser degree , even Fox may be considered to be quasi-independent stations as these networks mainly provide programming during primetime , with limited to no network-supplied content in other time periods . Independent radio is a similar concept with regards to community radio stations , although with a slightly different meaning ( as many non-indie commercial broadcasting radio stations produce the vast majority of their own programming , perhaps retaining only a nominal affiliation with a radio network for news updates or syndicated radio programming ) .",

As of July 2016 the city has a population of 531,902 , and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296 . It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada . The Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec , an Algonquin [ note 1 ] word meaning where the river narrows , because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant . Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608 , and adopted the Algonquin name . Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America . The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec ( Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec ) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico . This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec . The city 's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec , an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence . The National Assembly of Quebec ( provincial legislature ) , the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec ( National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec ) , and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation ( Museum of Civilization ) are found within or near Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec .",

It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada ( with Ontario ) . Quebec is the second-most populous province of Canada , after Ontario . It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population , with French as the sole provincial official language . Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City , the capital . Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area , including the Island of Montreal . English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais , Eastern Townships , and Gasp\u00e9 regions .

The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east , and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits , respectively . The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years . France 's first settlement in North America , Port-Royal , was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of Acadia for over a hundred years . The Fortress of Louisbourg was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area , changing hands numerous times in the until France relinquished its claims with the Treaty of Paris in 1763 . During the American Revolutionary War , thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia . In 1848 , Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government , and it federated in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada ( now Ontario and Quebec ) to form what is now the country of Canada . Nova Scotia 's capital and largest city is Halifax , which is today home to about 45 per cent of the province 's population , is the thirteenth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada , the largest city in Atlantic Canada , and Canadas second largest coastal city ( after Vancouver ) .",

The first railway station was named Hobbema after the Dutch painter Meindert Hobbema during the construction of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in 1891 . As a result , all of Hobbema 's neighbouring communities came to bear names of First Nations origin ( Ponoka ( elk ) , Menaik ( spruce ) , Wetaskiwin ( hills where peace was made ) ) , with the exception of Hobbema itself .

Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore .

However , a group of ten Acadian families from Port-Toulouse fled to this Isle Madame where their descendants still live today . Following the Seven Years ' War , \u00cele-Royale and its constituent territories such as Isle Madame , reverted to British control . Some Acadian families also made their way from Massachusetts to Isle Madame in 1766 . Measuring 16 km long and 11 km wide , giving approximately 45 km2 , Isle Madame is jurisdictionally part of Richmond County and is separated from Cape Breton Island by a narrow strait named Lennox Passage . Initially , the strait was crossed by ferries . The first swing bridge crossing Lennox Passage to connect with Isle Madame was constructed beginning in 1916 , and opened in 1919 . The Grandique Ferry service also crossed the passage between Martinique and Louisdale . In 1970 , following the grounding and subsequent breakup of the Liberian tanker Arrow in Chedabucto Bay spilling her cargo of heavy bunker C oil , the Government of Nova Scotia built a causeway between Burnt Point and Burnt Island to prevent the spilled oil from further damaging the fishing area of the Passage .",
