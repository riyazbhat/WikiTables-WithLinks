Its tone is set by the juxtaposition of slow moving photographic images and Shakespeare 's sonnets read by Judi Dench . The film consists primarily of homoerotic images and opaque landscapes through which two men take a journey into their own desires . Jarman himself described the film as a dream world , a world of magic and ritual , yet there are images there of the burning cars and radar systems , which remind you there is a price to be paid in order to gain this dream in the face of a world of violence . The soundtrack to the film was composed and performed by Coil , and it was released as an album of the same name .

  "/wiki/A_Patriot_for_Me": "A Patriot for Me is a 1965 play by the English playwright John Osborne , based on the true story of Alfred Redl . It was notable for being denied a licence for performance by the censor of the time . The play depicts Redl , a homosexual in the Austro-Hungarian intelligence service in the 1890s , as he is blackmailed by the Russians into a series of treasonous betrayals . Its dramatic climax , and the scene that most excited the censor , is the Drag Ball , in which members of the upper echelons of Viennese society appear in drag . Mary McCarthy , the American novelist , wrote in The Observer that the play 's chief merit is to provide work for a number of homosexual actors , or normal actors who can pass as homosexual . A Patriot for Me remains rarely performed because of the large cast required . When the Royal Court Theatre produced A Patriot For Me in 1965 , it was forced to change from a public theatre to a private members ' club . The play was deemed too sexually transgressive by the Lord Chamberlain 's Office , and denied a licence for performance . The Royal Court suffered a considerable financial loss because of this denial . George Devine , founder of the English Stage Company , was performing in this play when he died of a heart attack . A musical adaptation of A Patriot for Me , with music by Laurence Rosenthal , was produced on Broadway in 1969 . The play was an influence on the later film Colonel Redl .",

  "/wiki/Alfred_Redl": "Alfred Redl ( 14 March 1864 - 25 May 1913 ) was an Austrian military officer who rose to head the Evidenzbureau , the counter-intelligence wing of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army . Redl was one of the leading figures of pre-World War I espionage ; his term in office was marked by radical innovations and the use of advanced technology to ensnare foreign spies . Due to the innovations he introduced , Redl 's successor , Major Maximilian Ronge , ultimately learned in 1913 that Redl was himself a lavishly paid spy for the intelligence services of the Imperial Russian Army . Soon after his exposure , Redl committed suicide . Although his motivations remain mysterious , some historians believe that Redl may have been blackmailed by Russian intelligence with evidence of his homosexuality . Other possible reasons may have been greed , career frustrations , or even a narcissistic desire to outsmart his superiors and subordinates . Although the full extent of his disclosures to Russian intelligence also remains unknown , Col. Redl is believed to have been largely responsible for Austria-Hungary 's catastrophic military defeats and devastating combat losses during the First World War and even for the subsequent collapse of the Empire in 1918 . For this reason , many historians of the Habsburg Empire , as well as espionage historians such as the American Allen Dulles and Soviet General Mikhail Milstein , agree in calling Redl an arch-traitor .",

  "/wiki/Kiss_of_the_Spider_Woman_(novel)": "Kiss of the Spider Woman ( Spanish : El beso de la mujer ara\u00f1a ) is a 1976 novel by Argentine writer Manuel Puig . It depicts the daily conversations between two cellmates in an Argentine prison , Molina and Valent\u00edn , and the intimate bond they form in the process . It is generally considered Puig 's most successful work . The novel 's form is unusual in that there is no traditional narrative voice , one of the primary features of fiction . It is written in large part as dialogue , without any indication of who is speaking , except for a dash ( - ) to show a change of speaker . There are also significant portions of stream-of-consciousness writing . What is not written as dialogue or stream-of-consciousness is written as meta-fictional government documentation . The conversations between the characters , when not focused on the moment at hand , are recountings of films that Molina has seen , which act as a form of escape from their environment . Thus there are a main plot , several subplots , and five additional stories that comprise the novel . Puig adapted the novel into a stage play in 1983 , with an English translation by Allan Baker . It was also made into an Academy Award-winning film in 1985 and a Broadway musical in 1993 .",
