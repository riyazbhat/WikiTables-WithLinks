  "/wiki/1984_Chesterfield_by-election": "The Chesterfield by-election , 1984 was held on 1 March 1984 for a seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom to represent Chesterfield in Derbyshire . This followed the resignation of the sitting Labour Member of Parliament ( MP ) Eric Varley . The eventual winner , former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn ( who had been ousted from parliament at the general election nine months earlier ) defeated sixteen other candidates , at the time the largest fielded in a British by-election - surpassing the previous high of twelve , at the 1981 Croydon North West by-election . This record would remain unbroken until the 1993 Newbury by-election . At the time , there was no requirement for political parties fielding candidates to be registered , resulting in some fringe candidates using slogans or frivolous titles as their party name . Actor Bill Maynard finished in fourth place , standing as an independent Labour supporter who opposed Benn 's candidacy . Other candidates included : John Davey , who ran in opposition to increases in the charges for NHS dentistry , Helen Anscomb , a by-election veteran who called for freight to be transported by rail to improve road safety , Donald Butler , a furniture shop owner who adopted the slogan a Chesterfield for Chesterfield , Giancarlo Piccaro stood for the 'Official Acne Party ' , pretending to be dedicated to the eradication of zits worldwide , T. A Layton stood in the name of the Spare the Earth Ecology Party , which he had founded , and David Cahill campaigned for The Sun to be treated as a comic . Chesterfield was Benn 's fourth by-election victory . He had first entered Parliament at the 1950 Bristol South East by-election and held that seat until he was disqualified from the Commons in 1960 , when he inherited a peerage , as Viscount Stansgate , upon his father 's death . At the resulting Bristol South East by-election 1961 , he won with an increased majority of votes , but because he was ineligible to take his seat , the Conservative candidate Malcolm St Clair was declared elected . When the law was changed to allow peerages to be renounced , St Clair resigned the seat and Benn won the Bristol South East by-election 1963 .",

  "/wiki/2008_Haltemprice_and_Howden_by-election": "The 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election was a by-election held in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2008 to elect a new Member of Parliament ( MP ) for constituency of Haltemprice and Howden . The by-election was triggered by the surprise and controversial resignation from the House of Commons of the sitting MP David Davis on 12 June 2008 . Davis 's stated intention was to spark a wider public debate on the perceived erosion of civil liberties in the UK by recontesting his seat on this single issue platform , launched as the David Davis for Freedom campaign . The two other main political parties Labour and the Liberal Democrats declined to field candidates , Liberal Democrats as they supported Davis in this issue and Labour as they considered the election a political stunt . Another minor party , the British National Party , ran no candidate as it supported Davis 's stance . Davis was subsequently re-elected to his seat with 72% of the vote . Davis received 17,113 votes , with the closest challenge coming from the Green Party and English Democrats with 1,758 and 1,714 votes respectively . All other candidates lost their deposit due to polling less than 5% of the vote . Due to the unusual circumstances , the election broke several records , including the most candidates running in a UK parliamentary by-election - 26 , the largest number of independents , the largest number of people losing their deposits and the best by-election results up to that point for the Green Party and English Democrats . While single issue by-elections such as this one were not unprecedented , they were rare in modern political times . Under election law , other candidates were free to stand on their chosen manifesto and not necessarily obliged to oppose or support Davis . Davis 's use of a by-election in this way attracted both praise and criticism from politicians , the public and the media , with The Sun newspaper initially considering fielding a candidate to oppose Davis in support of anti-terrorism legislation .",
