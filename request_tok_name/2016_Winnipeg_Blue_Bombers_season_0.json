  "/wiki/Virginia_Cavaliers_football": "The Virginia Cavaliers football team represents the University of Virginia in the sport of American football . Established in 1888 , Virginia plays its home games at Scott Stadium , capacity 61,500 , featured prominently at the center of its campus near the Academical Village . UVA played an outsized role in the shaping of the modern game 's ethics and eligibility rules as well as its safety rules , after a Georgia fullback died fighting the tide of a lopsided Virginia victory in 1897 . Quickly asserting itself as the South 's first great program with 28 straight winning seasons from its first in 1888 , Virginia football claimed 12 southern championships and was the first program outside the Northeast to defeat perennial power ( 26-time national champions ) Yale , on the first attempt in 1915 . [ a ] During those early days , Virginia established long-lasting rivalries that still continue on : particularly the South 's Oldest Rivalry with North Carolina and a heated rivalry with VPI ( now Virginia Tech ) . Virginia has also played William & Mary annually or biennially for extended stretches since 1908 . [ b ] Virginia lost its mantle as the region 's mark of success between World War I and World War II , but soon thereafter Art Guepe had Virginia winning big again . To avoid the trappings of big-time football , [ c ] university president Colgate Darden reduced scholarship and recruiting support , argued against joining the ACC , and declined an invite for Virginia to play unbeaten Georgia Tech in the 1952 Orange Bowl . [ d ] The Board of Visitors voted to join the ACC anyway , but Guepe left for Vanderbilt and Virginia soon embarked on a 28-game losing streak from 1958 to 1960 as Darden retired . Virginia became the worst ACC football team of the 1970s . [ e ] George Welsh led a dramatic turnaround effort from 1982 , and took Virginia to its first dozen bowl games and even its first AP No . 1 rankings throughout October 1990 .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Slotback": "Slotback , sometimes referred to as an A-back or , especially in the United States , slot receiver , is a position in gridiron football . The slot is the area between the last offensive lineman on either side of the center and the wide receiver on that side . A player who lines up between those two players and behind the line of scrimmage is a slotback . The position is a fixture of Canadian football and indoor football , but is also used in American football . The slotback is similar to the wide receiver but also has many of the same traits as a running back or tight end ; a slotback lines up closer to the offensive line and often farther back than a wide receiver . Slotbacks are often as many as five yards behind the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped and , in the Canadian and indoor game , may also make a running start toward the line of scrimmage prior to the snap . In most forms of American football , this would be an illegal motion , although a few professional leagues such as the World Football League and XFL allowed forward motion .",
