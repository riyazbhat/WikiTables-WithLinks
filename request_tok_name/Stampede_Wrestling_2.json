  "/wiki/Stu_Hart": "Stewart Edward Hart , CM ( May 3 , 1915 - October 16 , 2003 ) was a Canadian professional wrestler , wrestling booker , promoter , coach and trainer , football player , amateur wrestler , and sailor . He is best known for founding and handling Stampede Wrestling , a professional wrestling promotion based in Calgary , Alberta , teaching many individuals at its associated wrestling school The Dungeon and establishing a professional wrestling dynasty consisting of his relatives and close trainees . As the patriarch of the Hart wrestling family , Hart is the ancestor of many wrestlers , most notably being the father of Bret and Owen Hart as well as the grandfather of Natalya Neidhart , Teddy Hart and David Hart Smith . Hart was born to a poor Saskatchewan family but became a successful amateur wrestler during the 1930s and early 1940s , holding many national championships , as well as engaging in many other sports . He began wrestling for show in 1943 with the Royal Canadian Navy while serving in World War II as he could not go to the 1940 Summer Olympics due to the war . After leaving the service he travelled to America and debuted professionally for the New York wrestling territory [ d ] in 1946 . Hart was considered very handsome and a good in-ring performer , focusing on a submission-like and technical style of wrestling , but despite this and being popular in general he was not given a major spotlight by the writers , and soon after marrying Helen Smith , whom he met in New York City , he created his own promotion in Edmonton , Alberta which would be known as Stampede Wrestling [ e ] and took over the surrounding wrestling territory which covered most of western Canada and the US state of Montana . The territory would go on to become known as the Stampede territory thenceforth . In 1949 , Stu and Helen moved to Great Falls , Montana . Hart 's promotion featured a large variety of outside stars from the wrestling industry as well as homegrown talent for whom he booked storylines . Beginning from the 1950s Hart helped train a large number of people for his company and gained a reputation as one of the best teachers in the wrestling business . In October 1951 , Stu and Helen moved to Calgary , Alberta , into what would become the famous Hart House .",
  "/wiki/Professional_wrestling": "Professional wrestling , often shortened to pro wrestling or simply wrestling , is a form of performance art and entertainment that combines athletics with theatrical performance . It takes the form of events , held by touring companies , that mimic a title-match combat sport . The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on and evolved from classical and catch wrestling , with modern additions of striking attacks , strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers . Much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts . An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included . The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury . These facts were once kept highly secret but are now publicly acknowledged by both performers and promotions . To promote and sustain the willing suspension of disbelief by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude , the performing company avoids discussing the true nature of the performance in official media . Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media ( i.e. , interviews ) often directly acknowledge the dramatic and fixed nature of the spectacle . [ citation needed ]",
