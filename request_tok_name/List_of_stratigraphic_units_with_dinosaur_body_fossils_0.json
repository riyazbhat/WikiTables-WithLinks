With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence .

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions .

The Drumheller Coal Zone , located in the lower part of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation , was mined for sub-bituminous coal in the Drumheller area from 1911 to 1979 , and the Atlas Coal Mine in Drumheller has been preserved as a National Historic Site . In more recent times , the Horseshoe Canyon Formation has become a major target for coalbed methane ( CBM ) production .",
  "/wiki/Huincul_Formation": "The Huincul Formation is a geologic formation of Late Cretaceous ( Early Cenomanian to Late Turonian ) age of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin that outcrops in the Mendoza , R\u00edo Negro and Neuqu\u00e9n Provinces of northern Patagonia , Argentina . It is the second formation in the R\u00edo Limay Subgroup , the oldest subgroup within the Neuqu\u00e9n Group . Formerly that subgroup was treated as a formation , and the Huincul Formation was known as the Huincul Member .",
  "/wiki/Iren_Dabasu_Formation": "The Iren Dabasu Formation is a Late Cretaceous ( Santonian ) geologic formation in the Iren Nor region of Inner Mongolia . Dinosaur remains diagnostic to the genus level are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation . It is located in the Iren Nor region of China .",
  "/wiki/Jiufotang_Formation": "The Jiufotang Formation ( Chinese : \u4e5d\u4f5b\u5802\u7ec4 , pinyin : ji\u01d4f\u00f3t\u00e1ng z\u01d4 ) is an Early Cretaceous geological formation in Chaoyang , Liaoning which has yielded fossils of feathered dinosaurs , primitive birds , pterosaurs , and other organisms ( see Jehol Biota ) . It is a member of the Jehol group . The exact age of the Jiufotang has been debated for years , with estimates ranging from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous . He et al . ( 2004 ) used argon - isotope radiometry to confirm biostratigraphic age estimates . They confirmed an Early Cretaceous , Aptian age for the Jiufotang Formation , 120.3 +/-0.7 million years ago . Fossils of Microraptor and Jeholornis are from the Jiufotang .",
  "/wiki/Aptian": "The Aptian is an age in the geologic timescale or a stage in the stratigraphic column . It is a subdivision of the Early or Lower Cretaceous epoch or series and encompasses the time from 125.0 \u00b1 1.0 Ma to 113.0 \u00b1 1.0 Ma ( million years ago ) , approximately . The Aptian succeeds the Barremian and precedes the Albian , all part of the Lower/Early Cretaceous . The Aptian partly overlaps the upper part of the regionally used ( in Western Europe ) stage Urgonian . The Selli Event , also known as OAE1a , was one of two oceanic Anoxic events in the Cretaceous period , which occurred around 120 Ma and lasted approximately 1 to 1.3 million years . The Aptian extinction was a minor extinction event hypothesized to have occurred around 116 to 117 Ma .",
  "/wiki/Judith_River_Formation": "The Judith River Formation is a fossil-bearing geologic formation in Montana , and is part of the Judith River Group . It dates to the Late Cretaceous , between 80 and 75 million years ago , corresponding to the Judithian land vertebrate age . It was laid down during the same time period as portions of the Two Medicine Formation of Montana and the Oldman Formation of Alberta . It is an historically important formation , explored by early American paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope , who named several dinosaurs from scrappy remains found here on his 1876 expedition ( such as Monoclonius ) . Modern work has found nearly complete skeletons of the hadrosaurid Brachylophosaurus .",
  "/wiki/Kaiparowits_Formation": "The Kaiparowits Formation is a sedimentary rock formation found in the Kaiparowits Plateau in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument , in the southern part of Utah in the western United States . It is over 2800 feet ( 850 m ) thick , and is Campanian in age . This Upper Cretaceous formation was formed from alluvial floodplains of large rivers in coastal southern Laramidia ; sandstone beds are the deposit of rivers , and mudstone beds represent floodplain deposits . It is fossiliferous , with most specimens from the lower half of the formation , but exploration is only comparatively recent , with most work being done since 1982 . It has been estimated that less than 10% of the Kaiparowits formation has been explored for fossils . Most fieldwork has been conducted by The Natural History Museum of Utah ."
