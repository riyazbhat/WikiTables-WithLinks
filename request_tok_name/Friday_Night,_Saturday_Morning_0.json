Entering Parliament in 1945 , Wilson was appointed a parliamentary secretary in the Attlee ministry and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks ; he became Secretary for Overseas Trade in 1947 and was elevated to Cabinet shortly thereafter as President of the Board of Trade . In opposition to the next Conservative government , he served as Shadow Chancellor ( 1955-1961 ) and Shadow Foreign Secretary ( 1961-1963 ) . After Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell died suddenly in 1963 , Wilson won the subsequent leadership election . After narrowly winning the 1964 general election , Wilson saw an increased majority in a snap election in 1966 . Wilson 's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity , though hindered by significant problems with Britain 's external balance of payments . In 1969 he sent British troops to Northern Ireland . After losing the 1970 election to Edward Heath , he spent four years as Leader of the Opposition before the February 1974 election resulted in a hung parliament . After Heath 's talks with the Liberals broke down , Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until another general election in October , resulting in a narrow Labour victory . A period of economic crisis had begun to hit most Western countries , and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister . Wilson 's approach to socialism was moderate compared with others in his party at the time , emphasising programmes aimed at increasing opportunity in society through relatively indirect means rather than the more direct socialist goal of promoting wider public ownership of industry and workers ' control of production . He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution 's stated dedication to public ownership as a stepping stone towards this goal , though he did not formally disavow it .",

He is best known for writing and playing his on-stage and television alter egos Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson . He is also a film producer and script writer , a star of London 's West End musical theatre , an award-winning writer , and an accomplished landscape painter . For his delivery of dadaist and absurdist humour to millions , biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as not only the most significant theatrical figure of our time \u2026 [ but ] the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin . Humphries ' characters have brought him international renown , and he also appeared in numerous stage productions , films , and television shows . Originally conceived as a dowdy Moonee Ponds housewife who caricatured Australian suburban complacency and insularity , Dame Edna Everage has evolved over four decades to become a satire of stardom - a gaudily dressed , acid-tongued , egomaniacal , internationally f\u00eated Housewife Gigastar . Humphries ' other satirical characters include the priapic and inebriated cultural attach\u00e9 Sir Les Patterson , who has continued to bring worldwide discredit upon Australian arts and culture , while contributing as much to the Australian vernacular as he has borrowed from it ; gentle , grandfatherly returned gentleman Sandy Stone ; iconoclastic 1960s underground film-maker Martin Agrippa , Paddington socialist academic Neil Singleton ; sleazy trade union official Lance Boyle ; high-pressure art salesman Morrie O'Connor ; and failed tycoon Owen Steele , and archetypal Australian bloke Barry McKenzie .",
  "/wiki/Dame_Edna_Everage": "Dame Edna Everage , often known simply as Dame Edna , is a character created and performed by Australian comedian Barry Humphries , known for her lilac-coloured or wisteria hue hair and cat eye glasses or face furniture , her favourite flower , the gladiolus ( gladdies ) and her boisterous greeting : Hello , Possums ! As Dame Edna , Humphries has written several books including an autobiography , My Gorgeous Life , appeared in several films and hosted several television shows ( on which Humphries has also appeared as himself and other alter-egos ) . Humphries has regularly updated Edna , originally a drab Melbourne housewife satirising Australian suburbia . Then he caused the Edna character to adopt an increasingly outlandish wardrobe after performances in London in the 1960s through which his Edna character grew in stature and popularity . She is also well-known for her outlandish spectacles . Barry Humphries has claimed that they were inspired by the glasses worn by Melbourne eccentric , beautician , radio broadcaster , actor and dancer Stephanie Deste , as were many other aspects of Dame Edna 's personality . Following film appearances and an elevation to damehood in the 1970s , the character evolved to Housewife and Superstar , then Megastar and finally Gigastar . Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Dame Edna became increasingly known in North America after multiple stage and television appearances . Edna describes her chat-shows as an intimate conversation between two friends , one of whom is a lot more interesting than the other . The character has been used to satirise the cult of celebrity , class snobbery , and prudishness and is often used by Humphries to poke fun at the political leaders and fashions of the times . Her exuberant persona and scathing commentary on society and celebrity , as well as her habit of treating celebrities like ordinary people ( on her television shows ) and ordinary people like celebrities ( in her stage shows ) have become signatures . Although Humphries freely states that Edna is a character he plays , Edna refers to Humphries as her entrepreneur or manager .",
