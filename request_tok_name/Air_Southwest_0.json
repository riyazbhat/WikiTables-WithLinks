During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries , Aberdeen 's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite , which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content . Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s , Aberdeen has been known as the off-shore oil capital of Europe . The area around Aberdeen has been settled for at least 8,000 years , when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don . The city has a long , sandy coastline and a marine climate , the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters . Aberdeen received Royal burgh status from David I of Scotland ( 1124-1153 ) , transforming the city economically . The city has two universities , the University of Aberdeen , founded in 1495 , and Robert Gordon University , which was awarded university status in 1992 , making Aberdeen the educational centre of north-east Scotland . The traditional industries of fishing , paper-making , shipbuilding , and textiles have been overtaken by the oil industry and Aberdeen 's seaport . Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland . Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival , a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018 . In 2015 , Mercer named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world , as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain .",

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire , Bradford rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture , particularly wool . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements , rapidly becoming the wool capital of the world . The area 's access to a supply of coal , iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford 's manufacturing base , which , as textile manufacture grew , led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment ; Bradford has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand Italianate City Hall . The textile sector in Bradford fell into decline from the mid-20th century . Bradford has since emerged as a tourist destination , becoming the first UNESCO City of Film with attractions such as the National Science and Media Museum , Bradford City Park , the Alhambra theatre and Cartwright Hall .

  "/wiki/Plymouth": "Plymouth ( /\u02c8pl\u026am\u0259\u03b8/ ( listen ) ) is a port city situated on the south coast of Devon , England , approximately 37 miles ( 60 km ) south-west of Exeter and 190 miles ( 310 km ) west-south-west of London . Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river Plym and river Tamar , which are naturally incorporated into Plymouth Sound to form a boundary with Cornwall . Plymouth 's early history extends to the Bronze Age when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten . This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire , until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century , now called Plymouth . In 1620 , the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony , the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America . During the English Civil War , the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646 . Throughout the Industrial Revolution , Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the Americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) . The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of Plymouth , the county borough of Devonport , and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough . The combined town took the name of Plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . The city 's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II , an act known as the Plymouth Blitz . After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .",
  "/wiki/Plymouth_City_Airport": "Plymouth City Airport ( IATA : PLH , ICAO : EGHD ) is a 'mothballed ' airport located within the City of Plymouth 3.5 NM ( 6.5 km ; 4.0 mi ) north northeast of the city centre in Devon , England at Derriford ( formerly Roborough ) . The airport opened on this site in 1925 and was officially opened by the future Edward VIII , as Prince of Wales , in 1931 . The airport is owned by Plymouth City Council and leased to Plymouth-based company Sutton Harbour Holdings . In 2009 , 157,933 passengers passed through the airport , a sharp increase of 34.0% on the 2008 total of 117,823 making Plymouth one of the few UK airports experiencing significant growth during the period . However , following the withdrawal of London flights in early 2011 , the airport 's owners said passenger totals had fallen to fewer than 100 a day . The London Stock Exchange was notified on 28 April 2011 that the airport would close by the end of the year . Plymouth City Airport had a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence ( Number P687 ) that allowed flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction , and was part of the Strasser Scheme . The airport closed and ceased all operations on 23 December 2011 . Since that time it has been mothballed with the aviation infrastructure and navigation aids retained pending an attempt by the leaseholder to change the use of the site in planning so that it can be disposed of for residential development . As result of the announced closure a group from the Plymouth business community initiated a campaign to protect the airport site . The group known as Viable delivered a petition to the City Council with more than 38,000 signatures objecting to the Airport closure and asking the Council to protect the site . A full Council debate on the petition concluded with a unanimous vote in support of the airport 's retention ."
