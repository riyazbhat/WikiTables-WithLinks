  "/wiki/Watt-peak": "The nominal power is the nameplate capacity of photovoltaic ( PV ) devices , such as solar cells , panels and systems , and is determined by measuring the electric current and voltage in a circuit , while varying the resistance under precisely defined conditions . These Standard Test Conditions ( STC ) are specified in standards such as IEC 61215 , IEC 61646 and UL 1703 ; specifically the light intensity is 1000 W/m2 , with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth 's surface at latitude 35\u00b0N in the summer ( airmass 1.5 ) , the temperature of the cells being 25 \u00b0C . The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between an open and closed circuit ( between maximum and minimum resistance ) . The highest power thus measured is the 'nominal ' power of the module in watts . This nominal power divided by the light power that falls on a given area of a photovoltaic device ( area \u00d7 1000 W/m2 ) defines its efficiency , the ratio of the device 's electrical output to the incident energy . The nominal power is important for designing an installation in order to correctly dimension its cabling and converters . If the available area is limited the solar cell efficiency and with it the nominal power per area ( e.g . kW/m2 ) is also relevant . For comparing modules , the price per nominal power ( e.g . $ /W ) is relevant . For a given installation 's physical orientation and location the expected annual production ( e.g . kWh ) per annual production assuming nominal power i.e .",

  "/wiki/China": "China ( Chinese : \u4e2d\u56fd ; pinyin : Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ) , officially the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , is a country in East Asia and is the world 's most populous country , with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017 . Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The dam is 178 metres ( 584 ft ) tall and was built for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation , irrigation , ice control and flood control . The dam supports a 1,280 MW power station with 4 x 320 MW generators that can operate at a maximum capacity of 1400 MW . Controlling ice , the dam controls downstream releases to reservoirs lower in the river , allowing them to generate more power instead of mitigating ice . Water in the dam 's 24.7 billion m3 reservoir provides irrigation water for up to 1,000,000 hectares ( 2,471,054 acres ) of land . The dam is composed of its main body and a gravity pier and secondary dam on both its left and right flank . The dam 's service spillway contains two 12 metres ( 39 ft ) wide gates that discharge water into two 260 metres ( 853 ft ) and 280 metres ( 919 ft ) long chutes .
