Based on the comic strip Li ' l Abner by Al Capp , the show is , on the surface , a broad spoof of hillbillies , but it is also a pointed satire on other topics , ranging from American politics and incompetence in the United States federal government to propriety and gender roles . After several other writers and composers considered musicalizing the comic strip , Al Capp finally made a deal in 1955 with the eventual creators for a musical to be financed by Paramount Pictures , which wanted to follow the stage version with a film musical . The Broadway production opened on November 15 , 1956 and ran for a moderately successful 693 performances . The score and Michael Kidd 's choreography received critical praise , but some critics felt that the book 's adaptation lost the spirit of the comic strip .
