  "/wiki/Phoenix_International_Raceway": "Phoenix Raceway is a 1-mile , low-banked tri-oval race track located in Avondale , Arizona , near Phoenix . The motorsport track opened in 1964 and currently hosts two NASCAR race weekends annually . Phoenix Raceway has also hosted the CART , IndyCar Series , USAC and the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship . The raceway is currently owned and operated by NASCAR . The raceway was originally constructed with a 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) road course that ran on both the inside and the outside of the main tri-oval . In 1991 the track was reconfigured with the current 1.51 miles ( 2.43 km ) interior layout . Phoenix Raceway currently has an estimated grandstand seating capacity of around 51,000 . Lights were installed around the track in 2004 following the addition of a second annual NASCAR race weekend . A further reconfiguration in 2011 increased the banking slightly , removed the road course entirely and removed the grass and curbing inside of the dogleg , giving sanctioning bodies the option of whether or not to allow drivers to shortcut the dogleg and run on the now-paved apron that replaced the grass . Renovations in 2018 reconfigured the pit road and infield areas , and moved the start/finish line to just coming out of what was turn 2 ( now turn 4 ) , before the dogleg . Phoenix Raceway is home to two annual NASCAR race weekends , one of 13 facilities on the NASCAR schedule to host more than one race weekend a year . It first joined the NASCAR Cup Series schedule in 1988 as a late season event , and in 2005 the track was given a spring date .",

New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century .
