  "/wiki/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats": "The Hamilton Tiger-Cats are a professional Canadian football team based in Hamilton , Ontario , Canada . They are currently members of the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . The Tiger-Cats play their home games at Tim Hortons Field . They were founded in 1869 as the Hamilton Football Club ( nickname Tigers ) . In 1950 , the Tigers merged with cross-town upstart Hamilton Wildcats and adopted the nickname Tiger-Cats . Since the 1950 merger , the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times , most recently in 1999 . The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club also recognizes all Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of their history , which would bring their win total to 15 ( the Hamilton Tigers with five , Hamilton Flying Wildcats with one and Hamilton Alerts also with one ) . However , the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise , rather as the individual franchises that won them . If one includes their historical lineage , Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century , a feat matched by only one other North American franchise in professional sports , the Triple-A Minor League Baseball team Rochester Red Wings of the International League . None of these three teams won a championship in the first two decades of the 21st century . In their first forty years of existence the Tiger-Cats qualified for the playoffs in all but three of those years and won seven Grey Cup championships . They are one of six teams in the modern era to win the Grey Cup at home and were the first to accomplish this when they did it in 1972 .",
  "/wiki/Montreal_Alouettes": "The Montreal Alouettes ( French : Les Alouettes de Montr\u00e9al ) are a professional Canadian football team based in Montreal , Quebec . Founded in 1946 , the team has folded and been revived twice . The Alouettes compete in the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and last won the Grey Cup championship in 2010 . Their home field is Percival Molson Memorial Stadium for the regular season and as of 2014 also home of their playoff games . The original Alouettes team ( 1946-1981 ) won four Grey Cups and were particularly dominant in the 1970s . After their collapse in 1982 , they were immediately reconstituted under new ownership as the Montreal Concordes . After playing for four years as the Concordes , they revived the Alouettes name for the 1986 season . A second folding in 1987 led to a nine-year hiatus of CFL football in the city . The current Alouettes franchise was established in 1996 by the owners of the Baltimore Stallions . The Stallions were disbanded at the same time as the Alouettes ' re-establishment after having been the most successful of the CFL 's American expansion franchises , culminating in a Grey Cup championship in 1995 . Many players from the Stallions ' 1995 roster signed with the Alouettes and formed the core of the team 's 1996 roster . For record-keeping purposes , the CFL considers all clubs that have played in Montreal as one franchise dating to 1946 , and considers the Alouettes to have suspended operations in 1987 before returning in 1996 .",

Of these teams , the Roughriders are both the oldest still in existence that continuously has been based in Western Canada ( as well as the oldest-surviving team in the CFL 's present-day West Division ) as well as the oldest in North America to continuously have been based west of St. Louis , Missouri . They are also the continent 's oldest community-owned professional sports franchise , older than every American professional sports team outside baseball other than the aforementioned Cardinals ( who , unlike the Roughriders , no longer play in their original city , and have moved twice in their history ) and older than every Canadian sports team outside football except the Montreal Canadiens , who were founded about nine months prior to the Roughriders . The team changed their name to the Regina Roughriders from the Regina Rugby Club in 1924 and finally to the current moniker in 1946 . The Roughriders played their home games at historic Taylor Field from 1936 to 2016 ; in 2017 , the team moved to the newly-constructed Mosaic Stadium at Evraz Place .

  "/wiki/Toronto_Argonauts": "The Toronto Argonauts ( officially the Toronto Argonaut Football Club , commonly referred to as the Argos ) are a professional Canadian football team competing in the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . Based in Toronto , Ontario , the team was founded in 1873 , and is the oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name , and they are the oldest-surviving team in both the modern-day CFL and East Division . The team 's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century . The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre ( originally known as SkyDome ) from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field , the fifth stadium site to host the team . The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 17 times and have appeared in the final 23 times . Most recently they defeated the Calgary Stampeders 27-24 in the 105th Grey Cup in 2017 . The Argonauts hold the best winning percentage in the championship game ( 73.9% ) and have the longest active winning streak in games in which they have appeared , at six . The Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the Grey Cup , while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats . The team was founded and owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years , and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956 . The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades , with attendance peaking in the 1970s . In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 's Larry Tanenbaum ( via the Kilmer Group ) and Bell Canada would acquire the team . The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season , which has long been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre and announced plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium , rendering it unfit for football .",
  "/wiki/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers": "The Winnipeg Blue Bombers ( legal name : Winnipeg Football Club ) are a professional Canadian football team based in Winnipeg , Manitoba . They are currently members of the West Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . They play their home games at IG Field after many years of playing at the since demolished Canad Inns Stadium . The Blue Bombers were founded in 1930 as the Winnipeg Football Club , which has always been the organization 's legal name . Unlike most other professional teams in the four most popular North American team sports ( but much more common in soccer , especially in Europe ) the official legal name Winnipeg Football Club continues to see significant everyday use alongside its nickname , particularly in local media and especially when reporting on the club 's business affairs . Another unique aspect to the club compared to other North American professional sports teams ( but also more common in Europe ) is that it is organized as a corporation without share capital , meaning no one person or entity owns the team - while there are two other community-owned non-profit professional football teams in the CFL and one in the NFL , unlike the Winnipeg Football Club they all have shareholders . Since their establishment , the Blue Bombers have won the league 's Grey Cup championship 11 times , most recently in 2019 when they defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 in the 107th Grey Cup . The team holds the record for most Grey Cup appearances of any team ( 25 ) and were the first club not located in Ontario or Quebec to win a championship ."
