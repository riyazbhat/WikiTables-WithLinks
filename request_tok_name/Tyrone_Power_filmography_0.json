Through his talent for staging , editing , and camera movement , he turned dynamic theatrical spaces into cinematic ones . He helped propel a number of actors to stardom , finding and directing Audrey Hepburn in her Hollywood debut film , Roman Holiday ( 1953 ) , and directing Barbra Streisand in her debut film , Funny Girl ( 1968 ) .

  "/wiki/Jesse_James": "Jesse Woodson James ( September 5 , 1847 - April 3 , 1882 ) was an American outlaw , bank and train robber , guerrilla , and leader of the James-Younger Gang . Raised in the Little Dixie area of western Missouri , James and his family maintained strong Southern sympathies . He and his brother Frank James joined pro-Confederate guerrillas known as bushwhackers operating in Missouri and Kansas during the American Civil War . As followers of William Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson , they were accused of participating in atrocities against Union soldiers and civilian abolitionists , including the Centralia Massacre in 1864 . After the war , as members of various gangs of outlaws , Jesse and Frank robbed banks , stagecoaches , and trains across the Midwest , gaining national fame and often popular sympathy despite the brutality of their crimes . The James brothers were most active as members of their own gang from about 1866 until 1876 , when as a result of their attempted robbery of a bank in Northfield , Minnesota , several members of the gang were captured or killed . They continued in crime for several years afterward , recruiting new members , but came under increasing pressure from law enforcement seeking to bring them to justice . On April 3 , 1882 , Jesse James was shot and killed by Robert Ford , a new recruit to the gang who hoped to collect a reward on James ' head and a promised amnesty for his previous crimes . Already a celebrity in life , James became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death . Despite popular portrayals of James as an embodiment of Robin Hood , robbing from the rich and giving to the poor , there is no evidence that he and his gang shared any loot from their robberies with anyone outside their close kinship network . Scholars and historians have characterized James as one of many criminals inspired by the regional insurgencies of ex-Confederates following the Civil War , rather than as a manifestation of alleged economic justice or of frontier lawlessness . James continues to be one of the most iconic figures from the era , and his life has been dramatized and memorialized numerous times .",

Technicolor became known and celebrated for its highly saturated color , and was initially most commonly used for filming musicals such as The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) and Down Argentine Way ( 1940 ) , costume pictures such as The Adventures of Robin Hood ( 1938 ) and Gone with the Wind ( 1939 ) , and animated films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) , Gulliver 's Travels ( 1939 ) , and Fantasia ( 1940 ) . As the technology matured it was also used for less spectacular dramas and comedies . Occasionally , even a film noir - such as Leave Her to Heaven ( 1945 ) or Niagara ( 1953 ) - was filmed in Technicolor .
