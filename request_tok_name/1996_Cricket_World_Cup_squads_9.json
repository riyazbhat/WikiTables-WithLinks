  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",
  "/wiki/Leg_spin": "Leg spin is a type of spin bowling in cricket . A leg spinner , also called leggie , bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action , causing the ball to spin from right to left in the cricket pitch when the ball bounces , that is , away from the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The same kind of trajectory , which spins from right to left on pitching , when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm unorthodox spin bowling . As with all spinners , leg spinners bowl the ball far more slowly ( 70-90 km/h or 45-55 mph ) than fast bowlers . The fastest leg spinners will sometimes top 100 km/h ( 60 mph ) . Leg spinners typically use variations of flight by sometimes looping the ball in the air , allowing any cross-breeze and the aerodynamic effects of the spinning ball to cause the ball to dip and drift before bouncing and spinning ( usually called turning ) sharply . While very difficult to bowl accurately , good leg spin is considered one of the most threatening types of bowling to bat against , since the flight and sharp turn make the ball 's movement extremely hard to read and the turn away from the batsman ( assuming he or she is right-handed ) is more dangerous than the turn into the batsman generated by an off spinner . One famous example of the leg-spin is the Gatting Ball or the Ball of the century .",
