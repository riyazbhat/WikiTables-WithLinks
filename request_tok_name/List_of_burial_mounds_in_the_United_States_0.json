  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",

With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States .

Its origin ( region : US-MS & title=Big+Black+River+source 33\u00b041\u203240\u2033N 89\u00b007\u203259\u2033W / 33.6944\u00b0N 89.1331\u00b0W / 33.6944 ; -89.1331 ( Big Black River source ) ) is in Webster County near the town of Eupora in the north central part of the state . From there it flows 330 miles ( 530 km ) in a generally southwest direction until it merges with the Mississippi River 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of the city of Vicksburg . It is the major contributor to the Big Black River Basin . It forms part of the northern border of Choctaw County , passes through Montgomery County , and forms the eastern border of Holmes County and the northern border of Claiborne County . The Big Black River and most of its tributaries are silt-filled . The rivers carry large amounts of suspended sediment , resulting mostly from agricultural runoff . These tributaries are slow-flowing muddy streams . However , some are swift-flowing with sandy bottoms . The Battle of Big Black River Bridge , fought during the Battle of Vicksburg , was part of the Vicksburg Campaign in the American Civil War .",
  "/wiki/Burial_mound": "A tumulus ( plural tumuli ) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves . Tumuli are also known as barrows , burial mounds or kurgans , and may be found throughout much of the world . A cairn , which is a mound of stones built for various purposes , may also originally have been a tumulus . Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape . In this respect , a long barrow is a long tumulus , usually constructed on top of several burials , such as passage graves . A round barrow is a round tumulus , also commonly constructed on top of burials . The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows has a broad range ; the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape . The method of inhumation may involve a dolmen , a cist , a mortuary enclosure , a mortuary house , or a chamber tomb . Examples of barrows include Duggleby Howe and Maeshowe . The word tumulus is Latin for 'mound ' or 'small hill ' , which is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *teuh2- with extended zero grade *tum- , 'to bulge , swell ' also found in tomb , tumor , tumescent , thumb , thigh , and thousand .",
  "/wiki/Indian_Mounds_Park_(Saint_Paul,_Minnesota)": "Indian Mounds Regional Park is a public park in Saint Paul , Minnesota , United States , featuring six prehistoric Native American burial mounds overlooking the Mississippi River . The oldest mounds were constructed 1,500-2,000 years ago by people of the Hopewell tradition . Later the Dakota people interred their dead there as well . At least 31 more mounds were destroyed by development in the late 19th century . They were the tallest Native American mounds in Minnesota or Wisconsin ( except for the unique 45-foot ( 14 m ) Grand Mound outside International Falls , Minnesota ) , and comprise one of the northwesternmost Hopewellian sites in North America . Indian Mounds Regional Park is a component of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area , a unit of the National Park System .

  "/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota": "Saint Paul ( abbreviated St. Paul ) is the capital and second-most populous city of the U.S. state of Minnesota . As of 2018 , the city 's estimated population was 307,695 . Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County , the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota . The city lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding its point of confluence with the Minnesota River , and adjoins Minneapolis , the state 's largest city . Known as the Twin Cities , the two form the core of Minneapolis-Saint Paul , the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States , with about 3.6 million residents . Founded near historic Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center , the city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 . The Dakota name for Saint Paul is Imnizaska . Regionally , the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center , home of the Minnesota Wild , and for the Science Museum of Minnesota . As a business hub of the Upper Midwest , it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab . Saint Paul , along with its twin city , Minneapolis , is known for its high literacy rate . The settlement originally began at present-day Lambert 's Landing , but was known as Pig 's Eye after Pierre Pig 's Eye Parrant established a popular tavern there . When Lucien Galtier , the first Catholic pastor of the region , established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul ( shortly thereafter to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul ) , he made it known that the settlement was now to be called by that name , as Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated , this monosyllable is short , sounds good , it is understood by all Christian denominations .",
  "/wiki/Sioux": "The Sioux ( /su\u02d0/ ; Dakota : O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b /ot\u0283\u02b0e\u02d0t\u02b0i \u0283ako\u02d0w\u0129/ ) are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America . The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux , and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation 's many language dialects . The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions : the Dakota and Lakota . Before the 17th century , the Santee Dakota ( Is\u00e1\u014byathi ; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota ) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . They gathered wild rice , hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish . Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota , where the Western Dakota ( Yankton , Yanktonai ) and Teton ( Lakota ) were residing . In the 1800s , the Dakota signed treaties with the United States , ceding much of their land in Minnesota . Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time , as well as low food supplies , led to the Dakota War of 1862 , which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska , North and South Dakota and Canada . After 1870 , the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota , creating the present-day reservations in the state . The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ( Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b and Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna ; Village-at-the-end and Little village-at-the-end ) , collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi\u010dh\u00edyena , resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858 . Despite ceding their lands , their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the Pipestone Quarry , which is the cultural center of the Sioux people . They are considered to be the Western Dakota ( also called middle Sioux ) , and have in the past been erroneously classified as Nakota .",

  "/wiki/Hopewell_tradition": "The Hopewell tradition ( also called the Hopewell culture ) describes the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern Eastern Woodlands from 100 BCE to 500 CE , in the Middle Woodland period . The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society , but a widely dispersed set of related populations . They were connected by a common network of trade routes , known as the Hopewell exchange system . At its greatest extent , the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Crystal River Indian Mounds in modern-day Florida as far north as the northern shores of Lake Ontario . Within this area , societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of activity along waterways . The Hopewell exchange system received materials from all over what is now occupied by the United States . Most of the items traded were exotic materials and were received by people living in the major trading and manufacturing areas . These people then converted the materials into products and exported them through local and regional exchange networks . The objects created by the Hopewell exchange system spread far and wide and have been seen in many burials outside the Midwest .",

  "/wiki/Copper": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu ( from Latin : cuprum ) and atomic number 29 . It is a soft , malleable , and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity . A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , as a building material , and as a constituent of various metal alloys , such as sterling silver used in jewelry , cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins , and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement . Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form ( native metals ) . This led to very early human use in several regions , from c. 8000 BC . Thousands of years later , it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores , c. 5000 BC , the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold , c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal , tin , to create bronze , c. 3500 BC . In the Roman era , copper was principally mined on Cyprus , the origin of the name of the metal , from aes \u0441yprium ( metal of Cyprus ) , later corrupted to \u0441uprum ( Latin ) , whence coper ( Old English ) and copper , first used around 1530 . Commonly encountered compounds are copper ( II ) salts , which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite , malachite , and turquoise , and have been used widely and historically as pigments . Copper used in buildings , usually for roofing , oxidizes to form a green verdigris ( or patina ) .
