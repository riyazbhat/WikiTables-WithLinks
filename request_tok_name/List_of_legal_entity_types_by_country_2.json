  "/wiki/Sole_proprietorship": "A sole proprietorship , also known as the sole trader , individual entrepreneurship or proprietorship , is a type of enterprise that is owned and run by one person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity . A sole trader does not necessarily work 'alone ' - it is possible for the sole trader to employ other people . The sole trader receives all profits ( subject to taxation specific to the business ) and has unlimited responsibility for all losses and debts . Every asset of the business is owned by the proprietor and all debts of the business are the proprietor 's . It is a sole proprietorship in contrast with partnerships ( which have at least two owners ) . A sole proprietor may use a trade name or business name other than their or its legal name . They may have to legally trademark their business name if it differs from their own legal name , the process varying depending upon country of residence .",
  "/wiki/Limited_partnership": "A limited partnership ( LP ) is a form of partnership similar to a general partnership except that while a general partnership must have at least two general partners ( GPs ) , a limited partnership must have at least one GP and at least one limited partner . The GPs are , in all major respects , in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm : they have management control , share the right to use partnership property , share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions , and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership . As in a general partnership , the GPs have actual authority , as agents of the firm , to bind the partnership in contracts with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnership 's business . As with a general partnership , an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership 's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners .",
  "/wiki/General_partnership": "A general partnership , the basic form of partnership under common law , is in most countries an association of persons or an unincorporated company with the following major features : It is a partnership in which partners share equally in both responsibility and liability .",
  "/wiki/Limited_liability_company": "A limited liability company ( LLC ) is the US-specific form of a private limited company . It is a business structure that can combine the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation . An LLC is not a corporation under state law ; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions . LLCs are well known for the flexibility that they provide to business owners ; depending on the situation , an LLC may elect to use corporate tax rules instead of being treated as a partnership , and , under certain circumstances , LLCs may be organized as not-for-profit . In certain U.S. states ( for example , Texas ) , businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license , such as legal or medical services , may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company ( PLLC ) . A limited liability company ( LLC ) is a hybrid legal entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship ( depending on how many owners there are ) . An LLC is a type of unincorporated association distinct from a corporation . The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability , and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation . As a business entity , a LLC is often more flexible than a corporation and may be well-suited for companies with a single owner . Although LLCs and corporations both possess some analogous features , the basic terminology commonly associated with each type of legal entity , at least within the United States , is sometimes different . When an LLC is formed , it is said to be organized , not incorporated or chartered , and its founding document is likewise known as its articles of organization , instead of its articles of incorporation or its corporate charter . Internal operations of an LLC are further governed by its operating agreement , rather than its bylaws .",
  "/wiki/Community_interest_company": "A community interest company ( CIC ) is a type of company introduced by the United Kingdom government in 2005 under the Companies ( Audit , Investigations and Community Enterprise ) Act 2004 , designed for social enterprises that want to use their profits and assets for the public good . CICs are intended to be easy to set up , with all the flexibility and certainty of the company form , but with some special features to ensure they are working for the benefit of the community . They have proved popular and some 10,000 registered in the status 's first 10 years .",
  "/wiki/Nonprofit_organization": "A nonprofit organization ( NPO ) , also known as a non-business entity , not-for-profit organization , or nonprofit institution , is an organization dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a shared point of view . In economic terms , it is an organization using its surplus of the revenues to further achieve its ultimate objective , rather than distributing its income to the organization 's shareholders , leaders , or members . Nonprofits are tax-exempt or charitable , meaning they do not pay income tax on the money that they receive for their organization . They can operate in religious , scientific , research , or educational settings . The key aspects of nonprofits are accountability , trustworthiness , honesty , and openness to every person who has invested time , money , and faith into the organization . Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors , founders , volunteers , program recipients , and the public community . Public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise . The more nonprofits focus on their mission , the more public confidence they will have , and as a result , more money for the organization . The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build the public 's confidence in nonprofits , as well as how ethical the standards and practices are .",
  "/wiki/Joint_venture": "A joint venture is a business entity created by two or more parties , generally characterized by shared ownership , shared returns and risks , and shared governance . Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons : to access a new market , particularly emerging markets ; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations ; to share risk for major investments or projects ; or to access skills and capabilities . According to Gerard Baynham of Water Street Partners , there has been a lot of negative press about joint ventures , but objective data indicate that they may actually outperform wholly owned and controlled affiliates . He writes , A different narrative emerged from our recent analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce ( DOC ) data , collected from more than 20,000 entities . According to the DOC data , foreign joint ventures of U.S. companies realized a 5.5 percent average return on assets ( ROA ) , while those companies wholly owned and controlled affiliates ( the vast majority of which are wholly owned ) realized a slightly lower 5.2 percent ROA . The same story holds true for investments by foreign companies in the U.S. , but the difference is more pronounced . U.S.-based joint ventures realized a 2.2 percent average ROA , while wholly owned and controlled affiliates in the U.S. only realized a 0.7 percent ROA . Most joint ventures are incorporated , although some , as in the oil and gas industry , are unincorporated joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity . With individuals , when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project , such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are co-venturers . The venture can be a business JV ( for example , Dow Corning ) , a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only , or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an industry utility that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants . Some major joint ventures include MillerCoors , Sony Ericsson , Vevo , Hulu , Penske Truck Leasing , and Owens-Corning - and in the past , Dow Corning .",
  "/wiki/Joint-stock_company": "A joint-stock company is a business entity in which shares of the company 's stock can be bought and sold by shareholders . Each shareholder owns company stock in proportion , evidenced by their shares ( certificates of ownership ) . Shareholders are able to transfer their shares to others without any effects to the continued existence of the company . In modern-day corporate law , the existence of a joint-stock company is often synonymous with incorporation ( possession of legal personality separate from shareholders ) and limited liability ( shareholders are liable for the company 's debts only to the value of the money they have invested in the company ) . Therefore , joint-stock companies are commonly known as corporations or limited companies . Some jurisdictions still provide the possibility of registering joint-stock companies without limited liability . In the United Kingdom and in other countries that have adopted its model of company law , they are known as unlimited companies . In the United States , they are known simply as joint-stock companies .",
  "/wiki/Public_limited_company": "A public limited company ( legally abbreviated to PLC ) is a type of public company under United Kingdom company law , some Commonwealth jurisdictions , and the Republic of Ireland . It is a limited liability company whose shares may be freely sold and traded to the public ( although a PLC may also be privately held , often by another PLC ) , with a minimum share capital of \u00a350,000 and usually with the letters PLC after its name . Similar companies in the United States are called publicly traded companies . Public limited companies will also have a separate legal identity . A PLC can be either an unlisted or listed company on the stock exchanges . In the United Kingdom , a public limited company usually must include the words public limited company or the abbreviation PLC or plc at the end and as part of the legal company name . Welsh companies may instead choose to end their names with ccc , an abbreviation for cwmni cyfyngedig cyhoeddus . However , some public limited companies ( mostly nationalised concerns ) incorporated under special legislation are exempted from bearing any of the identifying suffixes . [ citation needed ] The term public limited company and the PLC/plc suffix were introduced in 1981 ; prior to this , all limited companies bore the suffix Limited ( Ltd. ) , which is still used by private limited companies .",
  "/wiki/Privately_held_company": "A privately held company , private company , or close corporation is a business company owned either by non-governmental organizations or by a relatively small number of shareholders or company members which does not offer or trade its company stock ( shares ) to the general public on the stock market exchanges , but rather the company 's stock is offered , owned and traded or exchanged privately or over-the-counter . More ambiguous terms for a privately held company are closely held corporation , unquoted company , and unlisted company . Though less visible than their publicly traded counterparts , private companies have major importance in the world 's economy . In 2008 , the 441 largest private companies in the United States accounted for ( $ 1.8 trillion ) in revenues and employed 6.2 million people , according to Forbes . In 2005 , using a substantially smaller pool size ( 22.7% ) for comparison , the 339 companies on Forbes ' survey of closely held U.S. businesses sold a trillion dollars ' worth of goods and services ( 44% ) and employed 4 million people . In 2004 , the Forbes ' count of privately held U.S. businesses with at least $ 1 billion in revenue was 305 .",

  "/wiki/EEIG": "A European Economic Interest Grouping ( EEIG ) is a type of legal entity of the European corporate law created on 1985-07-25 under European Community ( EC ) Council Regulation 2137/85 . It is designed to make it easier for companies in different countries to do business together , or to form consortia to take part in EU programmes . Its activities must be ancillary to those of its members , and , as with a partnership , any profit or loss it makes is attributed to its members . Thus , although it is liable for VAT and employees social insurance , it is not liable to corporation tax . It has unlimited liability . It was based on the pre-existing French groupement d\u00b4int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique ( G.i.e. ) . Several thousand EEIGs now exist , active in fields as varied as agricultural marketing , legal advice , research and development , osteopathy , motorcycle preservation and cat-breeding .
