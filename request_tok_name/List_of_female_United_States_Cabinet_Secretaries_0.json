  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

Months into his first term , he signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 , which raised taxes and set the stage for future budget surpluses . He won ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement , a trade pact negotiated by President George H. W. Bush among the United States , Canada , and Mexico . Clinton 's most ambitious legislative initiative , a plan to provide universal health care , never received a vote in Congress as he was unable to win sufficient congressional support for the policy . Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 elections and Congressional Republicans led by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich proposed several conservative policies . Clinton vetoed many of these policies , but signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act into law . In foreign policy , Clinton launched a major bombing campaign in the Balkans , which led to the creation of a United Nations protectorate in Kosovo .

The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories .

Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions .

This position corresponds to what is generally known as a defense minister in many other countries . The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate , and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council .

To ensure civilian control of the military , no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a commissioned officer of a regular ( i.e. , non-reserve ) component of an armed force .

Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any commissioned officer , and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy , its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a de facto deputy commander-in-chief .

  "/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( /\u02c8ro\u028az\u0259v\u0259lt/ , /-v\u025blt/ ; January 30 , 1882 - April 12 , 1945 ) , often referred to by his initials FDR , was an American politician who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945 . A member of the Democratic Party , he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century . Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression , implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history . As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System and defined American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century . His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II , which ended shortly after he died in office . He is rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents , along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , but has also been subject to substantial criticism . Roosevelt was born in Hyde Park , New York , to a Dutch American family made well known by the reputation of Theodore Roosevelt , the 26th president of the United States , and William Henry Aspinwall . FDR graduated from Groton School and Harvard College and attended Columbia Law School but left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City . In 1905 , he married his fifth cousin once removed , Eleanor Roosevelt . They had six children , of whom five survived into adulthood .

  "/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan": "The presidency of Ronald Reagan began at noon EST on January 20 , 1981 , when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States , and ended on January 20 , 1989 . Reagan , a Republican from California , took office following a landslide victory over Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election . Reagan was succeeded by his Vice President , George H. W. Bush , who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan 's support . Reagan 's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic conservative shift to the right in American politics , including a loss of confidence in liberal , New Deal , and Great Society programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s . Domestically , the Reagan administration enacted a major tax cut , sought to cut non-military spending , and eliminated federal regulations . The administration 's economic policies , known as Reaganomics , were inspired by supply-side economics . The combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending led to budget deficits , and the federal debt increased significantly during Reagan 's tenure . Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( which simplified the tax code by reducing rates and removing several tax breaks ) and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( which enacted sweeping changes to U.S. immigration law and granted amnesty to three million illegal immigrants ) . Reagan also appointed more federal judges than any other president , including four Supreme Court Justices . Reagan 's foreign policy stance was resolutely anti-communist ; its plan of action , known as the Reagan Doctrine , sought to roll back the global influence of the Soviet Union in an attempt to end the Cold War . Under this doctrine , the Reagan administration initiated a massive buildup of the United States military ; promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems ; and , in 1983 , undertook an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War . The administration also created controversy by granting aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow leftist governments , particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan .",
