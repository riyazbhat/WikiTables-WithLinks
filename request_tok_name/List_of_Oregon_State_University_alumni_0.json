  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",

  "/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart": "Douglas Carl Engelbart ( January 30 , 1925 - July 2 , 2013 ) was an American engineer and inventor , and an early computer and Internet pioneer . He is best known for his work on founding the field of human-computer interaction , particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International , which resulted in creation of the computer mouse , and the development of hypertext , networked computers , and precursors to graphical user interfaces . These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968 . Engelbart 's law , the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential , is named after him . In the early 1950s , he decided that instead of having a steady job - such as his position at Ames Research Center - he would focus on making the world a better place . He reasoned that because the complexity of the world 's problems was increasing , and because any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people , the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence . He believed that the computer , which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation , would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems . He was a committed , vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world 's increasingly urgent and complex problems . Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab , which he termed bootstrapping . His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned , such that workers spent time improving their tools for improving their tools it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress . NLS , the oN-Line System , developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart 's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA ( as DARPA was then known ) , demonstrated numerous technologies , most of which are now in widespread use ; it included the computer mouse , bitmapped screens , hypertext ; all of which were displayed at The Mother of All Demos in 1968 . The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s , which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984 , and NLS was renamed Augment ( now the Doug Engelbart Institute ) .",
  "/wiki/Mouse_(computing)": "A computer mouse ( plural mice or mouses ) is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface . This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display , which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer . The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968 . Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion , but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts . Originally wired to a computer , many modern mice are cordless , relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system . In addition to moving a cursor , computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display . Mice often also feature other elements , such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels , which enable additional control and dimensional input .",

  "/wiki/Stem_cell": "Stem cells are cells that can differentiate into other types of cells , and can also divide in self-renewal to produce more of the same type of stem cells . Telomerase is active in normal stem cells . In mammals , there are two broad types of stem cells : embryonic stem cells , which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts in early embryonic development , and adult stem cells , which are found in various tissues of fully developed mammals . In adult organisms , stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body , replenishing adult tissues . In a developing embryo , stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells - ectoderm , endoderm and mesoderm ( see induced pluripotent stem cells ) - but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs , such as blood , skin , or intestinal tissues . There are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans : bone marrow , adipose tissue , and blood . Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth . Of all stem cell therapy types , autologous harvesting involves the least risk . Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies ( e.g. , bone marrow transplantation ) . Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed ( differentiated ) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves . Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer or dedifferentiation have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies . Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s .",

It has no generally accepted definition . Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof . When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena , mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature . Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects . Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist . The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry . Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements . Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano ( 1858-1932 ) , David Hilbert ( 1862-1943 ) , and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions . Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day . Mathematics is essential in many fields , including natural science , engineering , medicine , finance , and the social sciences .
