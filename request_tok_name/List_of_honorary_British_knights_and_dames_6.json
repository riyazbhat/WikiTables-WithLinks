It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest , Kosovo [ a ] to the northeast , North Macedonia to the east , Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece , Montenegro and Italy to the west . Geographically , the country displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28,748 km2 ( 11,100 sq mi ) . It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab , Skanderbeg , Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea . Historically , the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians , Thracians , Ancient Greeks , Romans , Byzantines , Venetians and Ottomans . The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century . The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century , the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe . Between the 18th and 19th centuries , Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance . After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

Located in northeastern Spain , the Aragonese autonomous community comprises three provinces ( from north to south ) : Huesca , Zaragoza , and Teruel . Its capital is Zaragoza ( also called Saragossa in English ) . The current Statute of Autonomy declares Aragon a historic nationality of Spain . Covering an area of 47720 km2 ( 18420 sq mi ) , the region 's terrain ranges diversely from permanent glaciers to verdant valleys , rich pasture lands and orchards , through to the arid steppe plains of the central lowlands . Aragon is home to many rivers - most notably , the river Ebro , Spain 's largest river in volume , which runs west-east across the entire region through the province of Zaragoza . It is also home to the highest mountains of the Pyrenees . As of January 2016 [ update ] , the population of Aragon was 1308563 , with over half of it living in its capital city , Zaragoza .

In 1469 , he married Infanta Isabella , the future queen of Castile , which was regarded as the marital and political cornerstone in the foundation of the Spanish monarchy . As a consequence of the marriage , in 1474 he became de jure uxoris King of Castile as Ferdinand V , when Isabella held the crown of Castile , until her death in 1504 . At Isabella 's death the crown of Castile passed to their daughter Joanna , by the terms of their prenuptial agreement and Isabellas last will and testament , and Ferdinand lost his monarchical status in Castile . Joanna 's husband Philip became de jure uxoris King of Castile , but died in 1506 , and Joanna ruled in her own right . In 1504 , after a war with France , he became King of Naples as Ferdinand III , reuniting Naples with Sicily permanently and for the first time since 1458 . In 1506 , as part of a treaty with a France , Ferdinand married Germaine of Foix of France , but Ferdinand 's only son and child of that marriage died soon after birth .

  "/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor": "Francis II ( German : Franz II . ; 12 February 1768 - 2 March 1835 ) was the last Holy Roman Emperor , ruling from 1792 until 6 August 1806 , when he dissolved the Holy Roman Empire after the decisive defeat at the hands of the First French Empire led by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz . In 1804 , he had founded the Austrian Empire and became Francis I , the first Emperor of Austria , ruling from 1804 to 1835 , so later he was named the first Doppelkaiser ( double emperor ) in history . For the two years between 1804 and 1806 , Francis used the title and style by the Grace of God elected Roman Emperor , ever Augustus , hereditary Emperor of Austria and he was called the Emperor of both the Holy Roman Empire and Austria . He was also Apostolic King of Hungary , Croatia and Bohemia as Francis I . He also served as the first president of the German Confederation following its establishment in 1815 . Francis II continued his leading role as an opponent of Napoleonic France in the Napoleonic Wars , and suffered several more defeats after Austerlitz . The proxy marriage of the state of his daughter Marie Louise of Austria to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was arguably his severest personal defeat . After the abdication of Napoleon following the War of the Sixth Coalition , Austria participated as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna , which was largely dominated by Francis 's chancellor Klemens Wenzel , Prince von Metternich culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis 's ancient dominions ( except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved ) . Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe , which largely resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies , Francis became viewed as a reactionary later in his reign . Francis II 's grandchildren include Napoleon II ( Napoleon 's only legitimate son ) , Franz Joseph I of Austria , Maximillian I of Mexico , Maria II of Portugal and Pedro II of Brazil .",
  "/wiki/Austria-Hungary": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world , after the United States , Germany , and the United Kingdom .

From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866 he was also President of the German Confederation . He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary , as well as the fourth-longest-reigning monarch of any country in European history , after Louis XIV of France , Johann II of Liechtenstein , and Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , in that chronological order . In December 1848 , Emperor Ferdinand abdicated the throne at Olomouc , as part of Minister President Felix zu Schwarzenberg 's plan to end the Revolutions of 1848 in Hungary . This allowed Ferdinand 's nephew Franz Joseph to accede to the throne . Largely considered to be a reactionary , Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains . The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over Tuscany and most of its claim to Lombardy-Venetia to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia , following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866 . Although Franz Joseph ceded no territory to the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War , the Peace of Prague ( 23 August 1866 ) settled the German Question in favour of Prussia , which prevented the Unification of Germany from occurring under the House of Habsburg . Franz Joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign . He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 , which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and transformed the Austrian Empire into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary . He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years , but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother , the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico in 1867 , the suicide of his only son and heir-apparent , Crown Prince Rudolf , in 1889 , the assassination of his wife , Empress Elisabeth ( Sisi ) , in 1898 , and the assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive , the Archduke Franz Ferdinand , in 1914 .

Following the suicide of Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the death of Karl Ludwig in 1896 , Franz Ferdinand became the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne . His courtship of Sophie Chotek , a lady-in-waiting , caused conflict within the imperial household , and their morganatic marriage in 1900 was only allowed after he renounced his descendants ' rights to the throne .

He reigned between July 1831 and December 1865 . Born into the ruling family of the small German duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , Leopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars . After Napoleon 's defeat , Leopold moved to the United Kingdom where he married Princess Charlotte of Wales , who was second in line to the British throne and the only legitimate child of the Prince Regent ( the future King George IV ) . Charlotte died after only a year of marriage , but Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain . After the Greek War of Independence ( 1821-32 ) , Leopold was offered the crown of Greece but turned it down , believing it to be too precarious . Instead , Leopold accepted the kingship of the newly established Kingdom of Belgium in 1831 . The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe , and because as the British-backed candidate , he was not affiliated with other powers , such as France , which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna . Leopold took his oath as King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831 , an event commemorated annually as Belgian National Day . His reign was marked by attempts by the Dutch to recapture Belgium and , later , by internal political division between liberals and Catholics . As a Protestant , Leopold was considered liberal and encouraged economic modernisation , playing an important role in encouraging the creation of Belgium 's first railway in 1835 and subsequent industrialisation . As a result of the ambiguities in the Belgian Constitution , Leopold was able to slightly expand the monarch 's powers during his reign .",

He died without surviving sons . The current Belgian king descends from his nephew and successor , Albert I. Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State , a private project undertaken on his own behalf . He used Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo , the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 , the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants . Leopold ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal gain . He extracted a fortune from the territory , initially by the collection of ivory , and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s , by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber . He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period . He donated the private buildings to the state before his death , to preserve them for Belgium .
