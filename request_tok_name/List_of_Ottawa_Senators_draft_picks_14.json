  "/wiki/Upper_Canada_College": "Upper Canada College ( UCC ) in Toronto , Ontario is a private school for boys between Senior Kindergarten and Grade Twelve , operating under the International Baccalaureate program . The secondary school segment is divided into ten houses ; eight are for day students and the remaining two are for boarding students . Aside from the main structure , with its dominant clock tower , the Toronto campus has a number of sports facilities , staff and faculty residences , and buildings for other purposes . UCC also owns and operates a campus in Norval , Ontario , for outdoor education . UCC was founded in 1829 by Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada Sir John Colborne , based upon Elizabeth College , Guernsey . It is the oldest independent school in the province of Ontario , the third oldest in Canada , and is widely described as the country 's most prestigious preparatory school , having many of Canada 's most powerful and wealthy as graduates . Modelled on the British public schools , UCC , throughout the first part of its history , both had an influence on and was influenced by provincial government and obtained a reputation as a WASP bastion . After facing closure by the government on more than one occasion , UCC became fully independent in 1900 , nine years after moving to its present location . A major crisis befell UCC when , in 1959 , the main structure at Deer Park was condemned and funds had to be quickly raised to build the Upper School that exists today . Through the 1960s and '70s , campus culture changed : the cadet corps was disbanded , the curriculum shifted from classical to liberal arts , and the student population became more culturally diverse . The college struggled between 1998 and 2004 with allegations of sexual abuse of students by teachers during the 1970s and '80s , as well as a related class-action lawsuit ; one former teacher was convicted . Beginning in 2002 , UCC made environmentalism a core component of students ' education , put focus on the issue of boys ' education , and , since 2007 , has aimed to improve the student body 's socioeconomic mix ."
