Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

  "/wiki/Laser_(dinghy)": "The Laser , is a highly popular family of small one-design sailing dinghies using the same common hull and interchangeable rigs with different sail areas . The laser is designed to be sailed single handed although class rules permit two sailors . Bruce Kirby designed the laser in 1970 with an emphasis on simplicity and performance . The Laser is one of the most popular yacht classes in history . As of 2018 , there are more than 215,000 boats worldwide . It is an international class with sailors in 120 countries , and an Olympic class since 1996 . A commonly cited reason for its popularity is that it is robust and simple to rig and sail , while also providing very competitive racing due to the very tight class association controls which eliminate differences in hull , sails and equipment . The laser hull can be fitted with different interchangeable rigs with varying sail area and similar parts . This allows for a wide range of sailors to sail and compete in a range of wind conditions despite the laser 's small ideal crew weight range for a given rig . Three rigs are recognised by the International Laser Association : original Laser standard with a sail area of 7.06 m\u00b2 ; the Laser Radial with a sail area of 5.76 m\u00b2 ; and the Laser 4.7 with a sail area of 4.7 m\u00b2 .

It is sloop-rigged , with a mainsail larger in proportional size than any other boat of its length . Unlike most modern racing boats , it does not use a spinnaker when sailing downwind . Instead , when running downwind a whisker pole is used to hold the jib out to windward for correct wind flow . Early Stars were built from wood , but modern boats are generally made of fiberglass . The boat must weigh at least with a maximum total sail area of . The Star class pioneered an unusual circular boom vang track , which allows the vang to effectively hold the boom down even when the boom is turned far outboard on a downwind run . Another notable aspect of Star sailing is the extreme hiking position adopted by the crew and at times the helmsman , who normally use a harness to help hang low off the windward side of the boat with only their lower legs inside .",
