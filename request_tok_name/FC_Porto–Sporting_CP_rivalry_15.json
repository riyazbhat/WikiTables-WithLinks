  "/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)": "A penalty kick ( commonly known as a penalty or a PK ) is a method of restarting play in association football , in which a player is allowed to take a single shot on the goal while it is defended only by the opposing team 's goalkeeper . It is awarded when a foul punishable by a direct free kick is committed by a player in their own penalty area . The shot is taken from the penalty mark , which is 11 m ( 12 yards ) from the goal line and centred between the touch lines . In practice , penalty kicks result in goals more often than not , even against the best and most experienced goalkeepers . This means that penalty awards are game-changing decisions and often decisive , particularly in low-scoring games . Similar kicks are made in a penalty shootout in some tournaments to determine which team is victorious after a drawn match ; these are governed by slightly different rules .",
