  "/wiki/Grey_County,_New_Zealand": "Grey County was one of the counties of New Zealand in the South Island . During the period 1853 to 1873 , the area that would become Grey County was administered as parts of Nelson Province and Canterbury Province . From 1873 to 1876 , the portions that had been administered by Canterbury Province were transferred to the newly created Westland Province . The overall area covered rural land and urban settlements , though the administrative authority for the urban area of Greymouth was transferred from Canterbury Province to the Greymouth Borough Council in 1868 . The reason that the area that would become Grey County went across a provincial boundary was that the boundary had been set as a straight line from the head of the Hurunui River to Lake Brunner at a time when the area was virtually uninhabited , but the West Coast Gold Rush then straddled that boundary . In 1866 , there was a failed proposal for portions of Canterbury Province , including the urban area of Greymouth and the rural area south to the Taramakau River , be annexed and solely administered by Nelson Province . With the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876 , Grey County was created , taking over administration of its area in January 1877 . The southern boundary of Grey County was the Taramakau River , and the maintenance of the bridge over the river was shared with Westland County . Grey County extended for 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) along the coast , and went inland as far as the great divide in the Southern Alps . The head of the local government administration was an elected chairman , with the county council 's administrative headquarters located in Greymouth Borough .

The suburb is linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and central Dunedin . The suburb was founded by wealthy pioneer William Henry Valpy , and its name reflects his family connections with the town of Reading , in the English county of Berkshire . Caversham grew rapidly during the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s because of its location on routes south to the Otago hinterland . By the end of the 19th century , Caversham was heavily industrialised , and its population included many skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople . This , combined with the community 's strong Protestant roots , led to the area 's generally left-leaning political stance . Caversham 's early history has been the subject of the Caversham Project , a major historical and archaeological study by the University of Otago .
