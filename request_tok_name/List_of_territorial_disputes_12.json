  "/wiki/Alaska_boundary_dispute": "The Alaska boundary dispute was a territorial dispute between the United States and the United Kingdom , which then controlled Canada 's foreign relations . It was resolved by arbitration in 1903 . The dispute existed between the Russian Empire and Britain since 1821 , and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the Alaska Purchase in 1867 . The final resolution favored the American position , as Canada did not get an all-Canadian outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea . The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States , and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in favor of healthier Anglo-American relations .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the R\u00edo de la Plata to the Paran\u00e1 River , and finally up the Paraguay River . In 1537 , they established the city of Asunci\u00f3n , which was the first capital of the Governorate of Paraguay and R\u00edo de la Plata . Paraguay was the epicenter of the Jesuit Missions , where the Guaran\u00ed people were educated and introduced to Christianity and European culture under the direction of the Society of Jesus in Jesuit reductions , mainly during the 17th century . However , after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish territories in 1767 , Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony , with few urban centers and settlers . Following independence from Spain at the beginning of the 19th century , Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments who generally implemented nationalist , isolationist and protectionist policies . This period ended with the disastrous Paraguayan War , during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25-33% of its territory to the Triple Alliance of Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . In the 20th century , Paraguay faced another major international conflict - the Chaco War - against Bolivia , from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious . Afterwards , the country entered a period of military dictatorships , ending with the 35 year regime of Alfredo Stroessner that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup .",

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

Its first settlement and capital was St. Mary 's City , in the southern end of St. Mary 's County , which is a peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay and is also bordered by four tidal rivers . The province began as a proprietary colony of the English Lord Baltimore , who wished to create a haven for English Catholics in the new world at the time of the European wars of religion . Although Maryland was an early pioneer of religious toleration in the English colonies , religious strife among Anglicans , Puritans , Catholics , and Quakers was common in the early years , and Puritan rebels briefly seized control of the province . In 1689 , the year following the Glorious Revolution , John Coode led a rebellion that removed Lord Baltimore from power in Maryland . Power in the colony was restored to the Baltimore family in 1715 when Charles Calvert , 5th Baron Baltimore , insisted in public that he was a Protestant . Despite early competition with the colony of Virginia to its south , and the Dutch colony of New Netherland to its north , the Province of Maryland developed along very similar lines to Virginia . Its early settlements and population centers tended to cluster around the rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay and , like Virginia , Maryland 's economy quickly became centered on the cultivation of tobacco , for sale in Europe . The need for cheap labor , and later with the mixed farming economy that developed when tobacco prices collapsed , led to a rapid expansion of indentured servitude , penal transportation , and forcible immigration and enslavement of Africans . Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province . The Province of Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution , and echoed events in New England by establishing committees of correspondence and hosting its own tea party similar to the one that took place in Boston . By 1776 the old order had been overthrown as Maryland citizens signed the Declaration of Independence , forcing the end of British colonial rule .",

  "/wiki/Vermont_Republic": "Vermont Republic is a term used since the 20th century to refer to the government of Vermont from 1777 to 1791 . In January 1777 , delegates from 28 towns met and declared independence from the jurisdictions and land claims of the British colony of Quebec , and from the American states of New Hampshire and New York . They called this territory New Connecticut ( see Connecticut River ) and sometimes referred to it by the name of the Green Mountains . The delegates also abolished adult slavery within their republic . Many Vermonters took part in the American Revolution , even though the Continental Congress did not recognize the jurisdiction 's independence . Because of objections from New York , which had conflicting property claims , the Continental Congress declined to recognize Vermont , then sometimes also known as the New Hampshire Grants . Vermont 's overtures to join the Province of Quebec were accepted by the British , offering generous terms for the Republic 's reunion . When the main British army surrendered in 1781 , however , American independence became apparent . Vermont , now bordered on three sides by American territory , rejected the British claims and instead negotiated terms to enter the United States . In 1791 , Vermont officially joined the United States as the 14th state . Vermont coined a currency called Vermont coppers from a mint operated by Reuben Harmon in East Rupert ( 1785-1788 ) , and operated a postal system .

Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England , Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France . After Charles I 's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649 , at the climax of the English Civil War , the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649 . However , England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth , and the country was a de facto republic led by Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , and Charles fled to mainland Europe . Cromwell became virtual dictator of England , Scotland and Ireland . Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France , the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands . A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy , and Charles was invited to return to Britain . On 29 May 1660 , his 30th birthday , he was received in London to public acclaim . After 1660 , all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 .

The most populous city , Burlington , is the least populous city to be the most populous city in a state . Vermont 's crime statistics for the period 2016-8 caused it to be ranked as the safest state in the country . For some 12,000 years , indigenous peoples inhabited this area . The historically competitive tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were active in the area at the time of European encounter . During the 17th century , French colonists claimed the territory as part of the Kingdom of France 's colony of New France . After the Kingdom of Great Britain began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast , the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe . For years , each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding and warfare between the New England and New France colonies .

  "/wiki/Admission_to_the_Union": "The Admission to the Union Clause of the United States Constitution , often called the New States Clause , found at Article IV , Section 3 , Clause 1 , authorizes the Congress to admit new states into the United States beyond the thirteen already in existence at the time the Constitution went into effect . The Constitution went into effect on June 21 , 1788 , after ratification by 9 of the 13 states , and the federal government began operations under it on March 4 , 1789 . Since then , 37 additional states have been admitted into the Union . Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with those already in existence . Of the 37 states admitted to the Union by Congress , all but six have been established within an existing U.S. organized incorporated territory . A state so created might encompass all or a portion of a territory . When the people of a territory or a region thereof have grown to a sufficient population and make their desire for statehood known to the federal government , in most cases Congress passed an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory or region to frame a proposed state constitution as a step toward admission to the Union . Although the use of an enabling act was a common historic practice , a number of states were admitted to the Union without one . In many instances , an enabling act would detail the mechanism by which the territory would be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers . Although the use of such an act is a traditional historic practice , a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted . The broad outline for this process was established by the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the 1787 Northwest Ordinance , both of which predate the present U.S. Constitution . The Admission to the Union Clause also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress .",

  "/wiki/Gore_(surveying)": "In old English law , a gore was a small , narrow strip of land . In modern land law and surveying , a gore is a strip of land , usually triangular in shape , as might be left between surveys that do not close . In some northeastern U.S. states ( mainly northern New England ) , a gore ( sometimes a grant or purchase ) is an unincorporated area of a county that is not part of any town and has limited self-government ( if any , as many are uninhabited or nearly so ) . Historically , gores were generally the result of errors when the land was first surveyed and the towns laid out . A gore would lie in an area between two ( supposedly abutting ) towns but would technically be in neither . Surrounding towns have been known to absorb a gore - for example , the gore between Tunbridge and Royalton , Vermont , was eventually incorporated into Tunbridge . Some gores have become towns in their own right , such as Stannard , Vermont . Different states have different laws governing gores and other unincorporated territories . In Maine , all unincorporated territories ( whether townships , gores , plantations , or grants ) are governed directly by the Land Use Planning Commission , a state agency . They do not , therefore , enjoy the rights and obligations of direct local self-governance of a corporate Maine municipality , via local elections of town boards of selectmen , and town meetings that debate and approve the town budget and expenditures . Occasionally , a town will choose to become unincorporated after having been an incorporated town ; a recent example of this is the former town of Madrid , Maine .",

Bound together in a political union , each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory and shares its sovereignty with the federal government . Due to this shared sovereignty , Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders ( such as paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) . States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state , and states may also create other local governments . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches , each with separate and independent powers : executive , legislative , and judicial . States , unlike U.S. territories , possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution .

Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of Puritan Separatists initially known as the Brownist Emigration , who came to be known as the Pilgrims . It was the second successful colony to be founded by the English in America after Jamestown in Virginia , and it was the first permanent English settlement in the New England region . The colony established a treaty with Wampanoag Chief Massasoit which helped to ensure its success ; in this , they were aided by Squanto , a member of the Patuxet tribe . Plymouth played a central role in King Philip 's War ( 1675-1678 ) , one of several Indian Wars , but the colony was ultimately merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other territories in 1691 to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Despite the colony 's relatively short existence , Plymouth holds a special role in American history . Most of the citizens of Plymouth were fleeing religious persecution and searching for a place to worship as they saw fit , rather than being entrepreneurs like many of the settlers of Jamestown in Virginia .

Border wars were not unusual in the early days of settlements of the colonies and originated in conflicting land claims . Because of ignorance , willful disregard , and legal ambiguities , such conflicts arose involving local settlers until a final settlement was reached . In the largest of these squabbles some 210,000 acres ( 849.8 km2 ) of land were at stake between New York and New Jersey .

Said point on the Delaware is Cochecton or Station Point . This border , set in 1664 , had been acknowledged by both the New York and New Jersey legislatures by 1719 . However , the northbound extension of New Jersey was not respected by settlers from New York who moved westward from Orange County . The resulting conflict was carried out by settlers from both sides . In addition , these settlers had to fight off Native Americans who also raided the area during the French and Indian Wars .

After independence , all of Spain 's colonial territories signed and agreed to proclaim their limits in the basis of the principle uti possidetis juris which accepts the Spanish colonial borders of 1810 as the borders of the new republics . Thus the borders of Gran Colombia which included Ecuador , Colombia and Venezuela would follow the borders of the Viceroyalty of New Granada , and Peru the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1810 . However , Peru was not satisfied with this and tried to set the date of her Uti Possitedis to 1824- a time when Peru was officially independent with territories Peru militarily occupied since 1820 . Tumbes and Jaen de Bracamoros , to which Peru had no colonial titles , were territories that declared their independence in 1820 and were militarily occupied by Peruvian patriot forces that convinced the people in these territories to join Peru . Because of this , Peru claims that part of its western territorial borders where it lacks title is derived from free determination of its people in the border areas after independence . In the eastern section known as Maynas or Mainas , which was the sparsely inhabited and entirely Amazon Basin , Peru bases its legal claims on the disputed Real Cedula of 1802 by which the Government of Maynas and the Government of Quijos , as well as the missions established in the rivers that flow into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n , which belonged until then to the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito , passed to the political and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of Peru . From the content of this Real Cedula it is clear that its main objective was to stop the Portuguese advances to the territories of the Spanish crown . Gran Colombia which declared independence 2 years earlier in 1819 and helped Peruvian independence war in the battles of Jun\u00edn and Ayacucho bases its rights on the clear Real Cedulas of 1717 , 1739 and 1740 and declares that the Real Cedula of 1802 is not political in nature , but was meant only for ecclesiastical and military jurisdiction , so also Peru bases in the clear Real Cedula of 1803 which ordered the incorporation of the province of Guayaquil to the Viceroyalty of Peru in which the two viceroys immediately proceeded to comply with the royal order and in fact and in law , Guayaquil became part of the viceroyalty of Lima . During the first 10 years of independence , Gran Colombia , under the leadership of Simon Bolivar , had continually protested Peru 's occupation of Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n ; Maynas had not been militarily occupied yet . Peru ignored Bol\u00edvar 's ultimatum to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n or face war .",

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",

Ecuador also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific , about 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) west of the mainland . The capital city is Quito , which is also its largest city . The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 17.1 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar . The sovereign state of Ecuador is a middle-income representative democratic republic with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . It is governed as a democratic presidential republic . One of 18 megadiverse countries in the world , Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals , such as those of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . In recognition of its unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights .

  "/wiki/Cordillera_of_the_Andes_Boundary_Case_1902_(Argentina,_Chile)": "The Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case ( Spanish : Laudo lim\u00edtrofe entre Argentina y Chile de 1902 ) was a British arbitration in 1902 that established the present day boundaries between Argentina and Chile . In northern and central Patagonia , the borders were established between the latitudes of 40\u00b0 and 52\u00b0 S as an interpretation of the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina . As result of the arbitration , some Patagonian lakes , such as O'Higgins/San Mart\u00edn Lake , became divided by a national boundary . Additionally the preferences of settled colonists in a cultivated part of the area in dispute had been canvassed . The boundary proposed in the arbitration was a compromise between the boundary preferences of the two disputing governments , which neither strictly followed the alignment of highest peaks nor the fluvial watershed , and was published in the name of King Edward VII .",

  "/wiki/Continental_divide": "A continental divide is a drainage divide on a continent such that the drainage basin on one side of the divide feeds into one ocean or sea , and the basin on the other side either feeds into a different ocean or sea , or else is endorheic , not connected to the open sea . Every continent on earth except Antarctica ( which has no free-flowing surface water ) has at least one continental drainage divide ; islands , even small ones like Killiniq Island on the Labrador Sea in Canada , may also host part of a continental divide or have their own island-spanning divide . The endpoints of a continental divide may be coastlines of gulfs , seas or oceans , the boundary of an endorheic basin , or another continental divide . One case , the Great Basin Divide , is a closed loop around an endoreic basin . The endpoints where a continental divide meets the coast are not always definite since the exact border between adjacent bodies of water is usually not clearly defined . The International Hydrographic Organization 's publication Limits of Oceans and Seas defines exact boundaries of oceans , but it is not universally recognized . Where a continental divide meets an endorheic basin , such as the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming , the continental divide splits and encircles the basin . Where two divides intersect , they form a triple divide , where three watersheds meet . Whether a divide is considered a continental divide distinguished from other secondary drainage divides may depend on whether the associated gulfs , seas , or oceans are considered separate . For example , the Gulf of Mexico is considered separate from the Atlantic Ocean , so the Eastern Continental Divide separates their respective watersheds . But the Sea of Cortez is usually not considered separate from the Pacific Ocean , so the divide between the Colorado River watershed which drains to the Sea of Cortez , and Columbia River Watershed which drains to the Pacific Ocean , is not considered to be a continental divide . Together , continental divides demarcate a set of drainage basins or watersheds , each of which drains to a specific ocean , sea or gulf , such as the North American Atlantic seaboard watershed which is demarcated by the Eastern Continental Divide and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Divide .",

The dispute originated with the Chilean annexation of the Bolivian Litoral Department in 1879 during the War of the Pacific . In 1879 the Chilean Army occupied San Pedro de Atacama , the main settlement of the current Chilean part of Puna de Atacama . By 1884 Bolivia and its ally Peru had lost the war and Argentina communicated to the Chilean Government that the border line in the Puna was still a pending issue between Argentina and Bolivia . Chile answered that the Puna de Atacama still belonged to Bolivia . The same year Argentina occupied Pastos Grandes in the Puna . Bolivia had still not signed any peace treaty with Chile until the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 . In the light that influential Bolivian politicians considered the Litoral Province lost for ever , the adjacent Puna de Atacama appeared to be a remote , mountainous and arid place difficult to defend . This prompted the Bolivian government to use it as a tool for to obtaining benefits from both Chile and Argentina . This led to the signature of two contradictory treaties in which Bolivia granted Argentina and Chile overlapping areas . The treaties were the following :",
