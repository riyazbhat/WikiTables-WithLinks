  "/wiki/FC_Arsenal_Kyiv": "Football Club Arsenal Kyiv ( ) is a Ukrainian football club based in Kyiv . The club claims to be a successor of Kyiv Arsenal factory team Arsenal which traces its history back to 1925 . The original factory team used to compete in the Soviet Second League , but was relegated in 1964 and supposedly continued to play in Kyiv city competitions . The football club of Ukrainian post-Soviet period was created in 1993 and brought to Kyiv from Boryspil by a geological company Geoton which was one of main sponsors of Football Federation of Ukraine and Ukraine national football team in the beginning . In 1995-2001 through a merger , the club was reconstituted by the Ministry of Defense as a government enterprise . During that period ( 1995-2001 ) it competed in the Ukrainian Top League under CSKA Kyiv brand as its senior ( main ) squad , while the original army squad continued to compete in lower leagues . In 1995 it was relocated to Kyiv playing at CSK ZSU Stadium and carried such names CSKA-Borysfen and CSKA , while the original FC CSKA Kyiv competing in lower leagues changed its name to CSKA-2 as its reserve squad . Due to difficulty of financing , the ownership of senior squad was transferred to the Kyiv city authorities during the winter break of 2001-02 as part of Oleksandr Omelchenko political project and the newly acquired squad was renamed as Arsenal in memory of the factory team . Between 2002 and 2008 , Arsenal was a municipal club of Kyiv city and played its games at the Olympiyskiy National Sports Complex . Later when the club was sold to the Ukrainian politician Vadym Rabinovych who promised to build own stadium for the club within the Kyiv city limits , but instead came up with a campaign to revive the history of another Arsenal Kyiv , a factory team of Kyiv Arsenal , which was dissolved in 1960s and consider the current Arsenal Kyiv a phoenix club of its predecessor . In 2013 soon after Rabinovych sold the club to another Ukrainian politician it was abandoned and dissolved . Due to the efforts of Ukrainian racer Oleksiy Kikireshko , the club was revived in 2014 as Arsenal-Kyiv and based in Shchaslyve located right on eastern outskirts of Kyiv .",
