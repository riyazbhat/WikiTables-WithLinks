  "/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States": "First Lady of the United States ( FLOTUS ) is the title held by the hostess of the White House , usually the wife of the president of the United States , concurrent with the president 's term in office . Although the first ladys role has never been codified or officially defined , she figures prominently in the political and social life of the nation . Since the early 20th century , the first lady has been assisted by official staff , now known as the Office of the First Lady and headquartered in the East Wing of the White House . Melania Trump is the current first lady of the United States , as wife of 45th president of the United States , Donald J. Trump . While the title was not in general use until much later , Martha Washington , the wife of George Washington , the first U.S. president ( 1789-1797 ) , is considered to be the inaugural first lady of the United States . During her lifetime , she was often referred to as Lady Washington . Since the 1790s , the role of First Lady has changed considerably . It has come to include involvement in political campaigns , management of the White House , championship of social causes , and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions . As first ladies now typically publish their memoirs , which are viewed as potential sources of additional information about their husbands ' administrations , and because the public is interested in these increasingly independent women in their own right , first ladies frequently remain a focus of attention long after their husbands ' terms of office have ended . Additionally , over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors , from fashion to public opinion on policy . Historically , should a president be unmarried , or a widower , the President usually asks a relative or friend to act as White House hostess . There are four living former first ladies : Rosalynn Carter , wife of Jimmy Carter ; Hillary Clinton , wife of Bill Clinton ; Laura Bush , wife of George W. Bush ; and Michelle Obama , wife of Barack Obama .",

A Republican lawyer from New England , born in Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts . His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action . The next year , he was elected vice president of the United States , and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 . Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor . Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity . As a Coolidge biographer wrote : He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions . That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed . He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics , while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably , although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality .",

As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House .

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

The Czech Republic is a landlocked country with a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,866 square kilometers ( 30,450 sq mi ) with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , with 10.7 million inhabitants . Its capital and largest city is Prague , with 1.3 million residents ; other major cities are Brno , Ostrava , Olomouc and Pilsen . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia . The Czech state was formed in the late ninth century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . In 1002 , the duchy was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire along with the Kingdom of Germany , the Kingdom of Burgundy , the Kingdom of Italy ; and became the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 , reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . The Protestant Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars , the first of many conflicts with the Catholic Church . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618-20 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War . After the Battle of the White Mountain , the Habsburgs consolidated their rule , eradicated Protestantism , reimposed Catholicism , and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization .",
  "/wiki/Valerie_Plame": "Valerie Elise Plame Wilson ( n\u00e9e Plame , August 13 , 1963 ) , is an American writer , spy novelist , and former officer who worked at the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . As the subject of the 2003 Plame affair , also known as the CIA leak scandal , Plame 's identity as a CIA officer was leaked to and subsequently published by Robert Novak of the Washington Post . In the aftermath of the scandal , Richard Armitage in the U.S. Department of State was identified as one source of the information , and I. Lewis Scooter Libby , Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , was convicted of lying to investigators . After a failed appeal , President George W. Bush commuted Libby 's sentence and in 2018 , President Donald Trump pardoned him . No one was formally charged with leaking the information . In collaboration with a ghostwriter , Plame wrote a memoir detailing her career and the events leading up to her resignation from the CIA .

  "/wiki/Non-official_cover": "In espionage , operatives under non-official cover ( NOC ) are operatives who assume covert roles in organizations without official ties to the government for which they work . This is in contrast to an operative with official cover , where they assume a position in their government , such as the diplomatic service , which provides them with diplomatic immunity if their espionage activities are discovered . Operatives under non-official cover do not have this safety net , and if captured and charged as spies are subject to severe criminal punishments , up to and including execution . Operatives under non-official cover are also usually trained to deny any connection with their government , thus preserving plausible deniability , but also denying them any hope of diplomatic legal assistance - or official acknowledgment of their service . Such an operative or agent may be referred to as a NOC ( pronounced /n\u0252k/ NOK ) or as an illegal ( see Clandestine HUMINT operational techniques ) . Sometimes , entire front companies or strawman entities are established in order to provide false identities for agents .",
  "/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",

The DO serves as the clandestine arm of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the national authority for the coordination , de-confliction , and evaluation of clandestine operations across the Intelligence Community of the United States . Under current policy ( beginning early as 2012 ) [ ref ] , the Deputy Director for Operations ' identity is not officially disclosed , although it is reported by some mainstream media sources the DDO was Greg Vogle .

  "/wiki/Plame_affair": "The Plame affair ( also known as the CIA leak scandal and Plamegate ) was a political scandal that revolved around journalist Robert Novak 's public identification of Valerie Plame as a covert Central Intelligence Agency officer in 2003 . In 2002 , Plame wrote a memo to her superiors in which she expressed hesitation in recommending her husband , former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson , to the CIA for a mission to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq had arranged to purchase and import uranium from the country , but stated that he may be in a position to assist . After President George W. Bush stated that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , Wilson published a July 2003 op-ed in The New York Times stating his doubts during the mission that any such transaction with Iraq had taken place . A week after Wilson 's op-ed was published , Novak published a column which mentioned claims from two senior administration officials that Plame had been the one to suggest sending her husband . Novak had learned of Plame 's employment , which was classified information , from State Department official Richard Armitage . David Corn and others suggested that Armitage and other officials had leaked the information as political retribution for Wilson 's article . The scandal led to a criminal investigation ; no one was charged for the leak itself . Scooter Libby was convicted of lying to investigators . His prison sentence was ultimately commuted by President Bush , and he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2018 ."
