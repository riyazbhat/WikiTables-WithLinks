  "/wiki/Bazookas": "Bazooka ( /b\u0259\u02c8zu\u02d0k\u0259/ ) is the common name for a man-portable recoilless anti-tank rocket launcher weapon , widely deployed by the United States Army . Also referred to as the Stovepipe , the innovative bazooka was among the first generation of rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat . Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion , it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank ( HEAT ) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles , machine gun nests , and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine . The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant 's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a bazooka invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns . During World War II , German armed forces captured several bazookas in early North Africa and Eastern Front encounters and soon reverse engineered their own version , increasing the warhead diameter to 8.8 cm ( among other minor changes ) and widely issuing it as the Raketenpanzerb\u00fcchse Panzerschreck ( Tank scare ) . Near the end of the war , the Japanese developed a similar weapon , the Type 4 70 mm AT Rocket Launcher , which featured a rocket propelled grenade of a different design . The term bazooka still sees informal use as a generic term referring to any ground-to-ground shoulder-fired missile weapon ( mainly rocket propelled grenade launchers or recoilless rifles ) .",
