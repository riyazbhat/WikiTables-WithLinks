  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",
  "/wiki/John_Wesley": "John Wesley ( /\u02c8w\u025bsli/ ; 28 June [ O.S . 17 June ] 1703 - 2 March 1791 ) was an English cleric , theologian and evangelist who was a leader of a revival movement within the Church of England known as Methodism . The societies he founded became the dominant form of the independent Methodist movement that continues to this day . Educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church , Oxford , Wesley was elected a fellow of Lincoln College , Oxford in 1726 and ordained as an Anglican priest two years later . He led the Holy Club , a society formed for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life ; it had been founded by his brother , Charles , and counted George Whitefield among its members . After an unsuccessful ministry of two years at Savannah in the Georgia Colony , Wesley returned to London and joined a religious society led by Moravian Christians . On 24 May 1738 he experienced what has come to be called his evangelical conversion , when he felt his heart strangely warmed . He subsequently left the Moravians , beginning his own ministry . A key step in the development of Wesley 's ministry was , like Whitefield , to travel and preach outdoors . In contrast to Whitefield 's Calvinism , Wesley embraced Arminian doctrines . Moving across Great Britain and Ireland , he helped form and organise small Christian groups that developed intensive and personal accountability , discipleship and religious instruction ; most importantly , he appointed itinerant , unordained evangelists to care for these groups of people . Under Wesley 's direction , Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day , including prison reform and the abolition of slavery .",

  "/wiki/History_of_manufactured_gas": "The history of gaseous fuel , important for lighting , heating , and cooking purposes throughout most of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century , began with the development of analytical and pneumatic chemistry in the 18th century . The manufacturing process for synthetic fuel gases ( also known as manufactured fuel gas , manufactured gas or simply gas ) typically consisted of the gasification of combustible materials , usually coal , but also wood and oil . The coal was gasified by heating the coal in enclosed ovens with an oxygen-poor atmosphere . The fuel gases generated were mixtures of many chemical substances , including hydrogen , methane , carbon monoxide and ethylene , and could be burnt for heating and lighting purposes . Coal gas , for example , also contains significant quantities of unwanted sulfur and ammonia compounds , as well as heavy hydrocarbons , and so the manufactured fuel gases needed to be purified before they could be used . The first attempts to manufacture fuel gas in a commercial way were made in the period 1795-1805 in France by Philippe LeBon , and in England by William Murdoch . Although precursors can be found , it was these two engineers who elaborated the technology with commercial applications in mind . Frederick Winsor was the key player behind the creation of the first gas utility , the London-based Gas Light and Coke Company , incorporated by royal charter in April 1812 . Manufactured gas utilities were founded first in England , and then in the rest of Europe and North America in the 1820s . The technology increased in scale . After a period of competition , the business model of the gas industry matured in monopolies , where a single company provided gas in a given zone . The ownership of the companies varied from outright municipal ownership , such as in Manchester , to completely private corporations , such as in London and most North American cities .",
