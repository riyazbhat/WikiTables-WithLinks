KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action .

It was mainly known for its use as an SS rank . As an SA rank , it was used after briefly being known as Untergruppenf\u00fchrer in late 1929 and 1930 . The rank was first created due to an expansion of the SS and assigned to those officers in command of SS-Brigaden . In 1933 , the SS-Brigaden were changed in name to SS-Abschnitte ; however , the rank of Brigadef\u00fchrer remained the same .

Translated as senior leader , an Oberf\u00fchrer was typically a NSDAP member in charge of a group of paramilitary units in a particular geographical region . From 1921 to 1925 , the phrase Oberf\u00fchrer was used as a title in the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) , but became an actual SA rank after 1926 .

By 1932 , Oberf\u00fchrer was an established rank of the SA , SS and NSKK . Oberf\u00fchrer wore two oak leaves on the uniform collar rank patch , along with the shoulder boards and lapels of a general officer . In 1938 , the status of SS-Oberf\u00fchrer began to change with the rise of the SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe which would later become the Waffen-SS .
