  "/wiki/Francisco_Alonso_Liongson": "Francisco Alonso Liongson ( 1896-1965 ) lived in one of the most exciting periods of Philippine history . He was born into an Ilustrado family from Pampanga , Philippines at the turn of the 20th century and raised with the revolutionary values of an emerging Philippine identity which held freedom , justice , honor , patriotism and piety sacred . He witnessed the rapid changes that transformed the Philippines from a repressed society cloistered in a Spanish convent for over 300 years into modern , hedonistic consumers of American Hollywood glamor for 50 years . This period of transition brought instabilities to core family values as the generation gaps wreaked havoc on the social , political , economic and political foundations of a young nation . It was a period of experimentation where the natives began to grapple a new democratic way of life and self-rule ; where sacred paternalistic relationships were giving way to egalitarian modes ; where traditional gender and familial roles were questioned , and where a new foreign language and the need for a national alternative were alienating the nation from understanding the aspirations of its elders . Liongson , in his unique , inimitable literary style captured snap shots of these struggles with anachronism in plays and articles written in the language that he mastered and loved best , Spanish . His works have since become precious gems of Philippine literature in Spanish and historic records of the Filipino psyche and social life between 1896 and 1950 .",

  "/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy": "A Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD , Ph.D. , or DPhil ; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae ) is the highest university degree that is conferred after a course of study by universities in most countries .

As an earned research degree , those studying for a PhD are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge , normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation , and defend their work against experts in the field . The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor , researcher , or scientist in many fields . Individuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may , in many jurisdictions , use the title Doctor ( often abbreviated Dr or Dr. ) with their name , although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field , culture , or society . Those who teach at universities or work in academic , educational , or research fields are usually addressed by this title professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation . Alternatively , holders may use post-nominal letters such as Ph.D. , PhD , or DPhil ( depending on the awarding institution ) . It is , however , considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time . The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country , institution , and time period , from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates . During the studies that lead to the degree , the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student ; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate ( see : all but dissertation ) .

  "/wiki/Prehispanic_Philippines": "The history of the Philippines between 900 and 1565 , also known as the pre-colonial period , begins with the creation of the Laguna Copperplate Inscription ( LCI ) in 900 and ends with the Spanish colonization in 1565 . The LCI is the first written document found in an ancient Philippine language . The inscription itself identifies the date of its creation , and its deciphering in 1992 made it possible to put the end prehistorical Philippines around 900 AD . Prior to the LCI , the earliest record of the Philippine Islands corresponded with the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 . Magellan was a Portuguese explorer in charge of a Spanish expedition to circummavigate the globe . Spanish forces were defeated by the chieftain Lapu-Lapu at the Battle of Mactan , and the Spanish conquest was delayed until a new expedition in 1565 during the reign of Philip II of Spain . Prior to the Spanish conquest , the Philippines were composed of different kingdoms , rajahnates and sultanates . Some were even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines . For example , Manila was once part of the Bruneian Empire , and many parts of the modern day Mindanao are theorized to have been part of the Majapahit empire with its capital being located in East Java in modern day Indonesia . It was the Spaniards who named the collection of Southeast Asian islands they conquered as Las Islas Filipinas , after the aforementioned Philip II of Spain , the geographical locations of which the modern day country of the Philippines based its territories today . Other sources of pre-colonial history include archeological findings , records from contact with the Song Dynasty , the Bruneian Empire , Japan , and Muslim traders , genealogical records of Muslim rulers , and the collected accounts which were put into writing by Spanish chroniclers in the 17th century , as well as then-extant cultural patterns which had not yet been swept away by the coming tide of hispanization . The period prior to Spanish colonization made the Philippines a part of both the Indosphere and Sinosphere .",

  "/wiki/Historiographers": "Historiography is the study of the methods of historians in developing history as an academic discipline , and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject . The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources , techniques , and theoretical approaches . Scholars discuss historiography by topic - such as the historiography of the United Kingdom , that of WWII , the British Empire , early Islam , and China - and different approaches and genres , such as political history and social history . Beginning in the nineteenth century , with the development of academic history , there developed a body of historiographic literature . The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties - such as to their nation state - remains a debated question . In the ancient world , chronological annals were produced in civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . However , the discipline of historiography was first established in the 5th century BC with the Histories of Herodotus , the founder of Greek historiography . The Roman statesman Cato the Elder produced the first history in Latin , the Origines , in the 2nd century BC . His near contemporaries Sima Tan and Sima Qian in the Han Empire of China established Chinese historiography with the compiling of the Shiji ( Records of the Grand Historian ) . During the Middle Ages , medieval historiography included the works of chronicles in medieval Europe , Islamic histories by Muslim historians , and the Korean and Japanese historical writings based on the existing Chinese model . During the 18th century Age of Enlightenment , historiography in the Western world was shaped and developed by figures such as Voltaire , David Hume , and Edward Gibbon , who among others set the foundations for the modern discipline . The research interests of historians change over time , and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic , economic , and political history toward newer approaches , especially social and cultural studies .",
