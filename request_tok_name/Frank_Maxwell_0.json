  "/wiki/The_Mountain_Road": "The Mountain Road is a 1960 war film starring James Stewart and directed by Daniel Mann . Set in China and based on the 1958 novel of the same name by journalist-historian Theodore H. White , the film follows the attempts of a U.S. Army major to destroy bridges and roads potentially useful to the Japanese during World War II . White 's time covering China for Time magazine during the war led to an interview with former OSS Major Frank Gleason Jr. , who served as head of a demolition crew that inspired the story and film . Gleason was later hired as an ( uncredited ) technical consultant for the film . The film is a rather somber treatment of World War II and includes themes that were taboo for Hollywood during the war years , such as tensions between allies and racism among American troops . The protagonist is a frustrated and morally conflicted U.S. officer unsure about the value of his mission . For these reasons , The Mountain Road is often labeled anti-war . But it was made with the cooperation of the Pentagon , and it is much more respectful of the military as an institution than are the well-known anti-war films of the 1960s and 1970s . As a World War II combat veteran , Stewart had vowed never to make a war film , concerned they were hardly ever realistic . The Mountain Road was the only war movie set during World War II in which he starred as a combatant . Stewart , however , had been featured in a wartime short , Winning Your Wings ( 1942 ) and in a civilian role in Malaya ( 1949 ) . Harry Morgan , another cast member in The Mountain Road , later said he believed that Stewart made an exception for this film because it was definitely anti-war .",
