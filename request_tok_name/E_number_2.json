  "/wiki/Fatty_acid": "In chemistry , particularly in biochemistry , a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain , which is either saturated or unsaturated . Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of an even number of carbon atoms , from 4 to 28 . Fatty acids are usually not found in organisms , but instead as three main classes of esters : triglycerides , phospholipids , and cholesteryl esters . In any of these forms , fatty acids are both important dietary sources of fuel for animals and they are important structural components for cells .",
  "/wiki/Ester": "In chemistry , an ester is a chemical compound derived from an acid ( organic or inorganic ) in which at least one -OH ( hydroxyl ) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl ( alkoxy ) group . Usually , esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol . Glycerides , which are fatty acid esters of glycerol , are important esters in biology , being one of the main classes of lipids , and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils . Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones . Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules . Nitrate esters , such as nitroglycerin , are known for their explosive properties , while polyesters are important plastics , with monomers linked by ester moieties . Esters usually have a sweet smell and are considered high-quality solvents for a broad array of plastics , plasticizers , resins , and lacquers . They are also one of the largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market .",
