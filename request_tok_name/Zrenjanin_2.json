  "/wiki/Germans": "Germans ( German : Deutsche ) are a Germanic ethnic group native to Central Europe , who share a common German ancestry , culture and history . German is the shared mother tongue of a substantial majority of ethnic Germans . The English term Germans has historically referred to the German-speaking population of the Holy Roman Empire since the Late Middle Ages . [ note 3 ] Ever since the outbreak of the Protestant Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire , German society has been characterized by a Catholic-Protestant divide . Of approximately 100 million native speakers of German in the world , roughly 80 million consider themselves Germans . [ citation needed ] There are an additional 80 million people of German ancestry mainly in the United States , Brazil ( mainly in the South Region of the country ) , Argentina , Canada , South Africa , the post-Soviet states ( mainly in Russia and Kazakhstan ) , and France , each accounting for at least 1 million . [ note 4 ] Thus , the total number of Germans lies somewhere between 100 and more than 150 million , depending on the criteria applied ( native speakers , single-ancestry ethnic Germans , partial German ancestry , etc. ) . Today , people from countries with German-speaking majorities which were earlier part of the Holy Roman Empire , ( such as Austria , Switzerland , Liechtenstein and other historically-tied countries like Luxembourg ) , most often subscribe to their own national identities and may or may not also self-identify as ethnically German .",
