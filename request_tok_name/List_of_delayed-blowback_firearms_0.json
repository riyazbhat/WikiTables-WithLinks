  "/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)": "A cartridge or a round is a type of pre-assembled firearm ammunition packaging a projectile ( bullet , shot , or slug ) , a propellant substance ( usually either smokeless powder or black powder ) and an ignition device ( primer ) within a metallic , paper or plastic case that is precisely made to fit within the barrel chamber of a breechloading gun , for the practical purpose of convenient transportation and handling during shooting . Although in popular usage the term bullet is often used to refer to a complete cartridge , it is correctly used only to refer to the projectile . Cartridges can be categorized by the type of their primers - a small charge of an impact- or electric-sensitive chemical mixture that is located at the center of the case head ( centerfire ) , inside the rim of the case base ( rimfire and the cupfire , now obsolete ) , in a sideway projection that is shaped like a pin ( pinfire , now obsolete ) or a lip ( lipfire , now obsolete ) , or in a small nipple-like bulge at the case base ( teat-fire , now obsolete ) . Military and commercial producers continue to pursue the goal of caseless ammunition . Some artillery ammunition uses the same cartridge concept as found in small arms . In other cases , the artillery shell is separate from the propellant charge . A cartridge without a projectile is called a blank . One that is completely inert ( contains no active primer and no propellant ) is called a dummy . One that failed to ignite and shoot off the projectile is called a dud , and one that ignited but failed to sufficiently push the projectile out of the barrel is called a squib .",

It should not be confused with the similarly named Russian 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge , a slightly longer , rimmed cartridge . It was introduced in U.S. service in the M14 rifle and M60 machine gun in the late 1950s . The M14 was superseded in U.S. service as the infantry adopted the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO M16 rifle . However , the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round remain in service , especially in the case of various marksman/sniper rifles , medium machine guns/general-purpose machine guns such as the M240 , and various rifles in use by special operations forces . The cartridge is used both by infantry and on mounted and crew-served weapons mounted to vehicles , aircraft and ships . Although not identical , the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO and the commercial .308 Winchester cartridges are similar enough that they can be loaded into rifles chambered for the other round , but the Winchester .308 cartridges are typically loaded to higher pressures than 7.62\u00d751mm NATO service cartridges . Even though the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) does not consider it unsafe to fire the commercial round in weapons chambered for the NATO round , there is significant discussion about compatible chamber and muzzle pressures between the two cartridges based on powder loads and wall thicknesses on the military vs. commercial rounds .",

Horthy officially represented the Hungarian monarchy of Charles IV , Apostolic King of Hungary . Attempts by Charles IV to return to the throne were prevented by threats of war from neighbouring countries and by the lack of support from Horthy . Charles died in 1922 , leaving the throne empty for the remainder of the country 's time as a kingdom . Hungary under Horthy was characterized by its conservative , nationalist and fiercely anti-communist character . The regency was based on an unstable alliance of conservatives and far-right wingers . Foreign policy was characterized by revisionism - the total or partial revision of the Treaty of Trianon , which had seen Hungary lose over 70% of its territory along with over three million Hungarians , who mostly lived in the border territories outside the new borders of the kingdom . Hungary 's interwar politics were dominated with an obsession of the territorial losses suffered in this treaty . Germany 's influence in Hungary has led some historians to consider that the country increasingly became a client state of Germany after 1938 . The Kingdom of Hungary was an Axis Power during World War II and focused to regain Hungarian majority territory which had been lost in the Treaty of Trianon , achieving this goal in early 1941 . By 1944 , following heavy setbacks for the Axis , Horthy 's government negotiated secretly with the Allies , and also considered leaving the war . Because of this Hungary was occupied by Germany and Horthy was deposed .",
  "/wiki/Submachine_gun": "A submachine gun , abbreviated SMG , is a magazine-fed , automatic carbine designed to shoot handgun cartridges . The term submachine gun was coined by John T. Thompson , the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun . The submachine gun was developed during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) . At its peak during World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , millions of SMGs were made as close quarter offensive weapons . After the war , new SMG designs appeared frequently . However , by the 1980s , SMG usage decreased . Today , submachine guns have been largely replaced by assault rifles , which have a greater effective range and are capable of penetrating the helmets and body armor used by modern infantry . However , submachine guns are still used by military special forces and police SWAT teams for close quarters battle ( CQB ) because they are a pistol-caliber weapon that 's easy to control , and less likely to over-penetrate the target .",

  "/wiki/FN_5.7\u00d728mm": "The FN 5.7\u00d728mm ( designated as the 5.7 \u00d7 28 by the C.I.P . ) is a small-caliber , high-velocity , smokeless powder , rebated rim , bottlenecked centerfire cartridge designed for handgun and personal defense weapon ( PDW ) uses and manufactured by FN Herstal . It is similar in length to the .22 WMR ( Winchester Magnum Rimfire ) ( 5.7\u00d727mm ) and to some degree similar also to .22 Hornet or .22 K-Hornet . Unlike many new cartridges , it has no parent case ; the complete package was developed from scratch by FN . The 5.7\u00d728mm was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense weapon and FN Five-seven pistol , in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge . In 2002 and 2003 , NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge . The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge and the 4.6\u00d730mm cartridge , which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7\u00d728mm . The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge , citing superior performance in testing , but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted . By 2006 , FN 's 5.7\u00d728mm firearms - the P90 personal defense weapon and Five-seven pistol - were in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world . In the United States , 5.7\u00d728mm firearms are currently used by numerous law enforcement agencies , including the U.S. Secret Service . In addition to being used in the FN P90 and FN Five-seven firearms , the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge has subsequently been used in a number of other weapons , such as the AR-57 and FN PS90 carbines . Excel Arms has developed four firearms chambered in 5.7\u00d728mm , and MasterPiece Arms offers three different firearms in 5.7\u00d728mm .",

  "/wiki/Singapore": "Singapore ( /\u02c8s\u026a\u014b ( \u0261 ) \u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Singapore , is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia . Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",
  "/wiki/Personal_defense_weapon": "Personal defense weapons ( PDWs ) are a class of compact , selective fire , magazine-fed , submachine gun-like firearms - essentially a hybrid between a conventional submachine gun and a compact assault rifle . Most PDWs fire a small-caliber ( less than 6 mm ) , high-velocity centerfire bottleneck cartridge resembling a scaled down/shortened intermediate rifle cartridge . This gives the PDWs better effective range , accuracy and armor-penetrating capability than submachine guns , which fire the larger-caliber handgun cartridges . The name describes the weapon 's original conceptual role : as a compact but powerful personal weapon that can be conveniently carried by support troops behind the frontline such as military engineers , logistic drivers , artillery crews or signallers . These soldiers may be at risk of encountering and having to defend against decently equipped enemy infiltrators in close quarters , which warrants an effective weapon that can suppress enemy charges and push them beyond a safe distance to prevent the defenders from being overrun , but such risk is rare enough that a long-barrel service rifle would be an unnecessary burden during their normal duties . Because of their ease of use , light weight and controllability , PDWs have also been used by special forces , paramilitaries , heavily-armed police and even bodyguards .",
  "/wiki/TKB-517": "The TKB-517 ( ) is an assault rifle designed by German Aleksandrovich Korobov . This rifle was externally similar to the AK-47 , but based on the lever-delayed blowback mechanism invented by John Pedersen and refined by P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly . It turned out to be more reliable and accurate , and easier to produce and maintain . Like the AK series , it was also manufactured with folding stocks , longer , heavier barrels with bipods ( forming light support weapons ) and even a belt-fed variant . Its rejection was because of a greater proficiency with the AK-47 among the Russian military .",
  "/wiki/7.62\u00d739mm": "The 7.62\u00d739mm ( aka 7.62 Soviet or formerly .30 Russian Short ) round is a rimless bottlenecked intermediate cartridge of Soviet origin that was designed during World War II . Due to the worldwide proliferation of the Soviet SKS and AK-47 pattern rifles , as well as RPD and RPK light machine guns , the cartridge is used by both militaries and civilians alike . Shortly after World War II , the AK-47 was designed , later becoming the world 's most widespread military-pattern rifle . The cartridge remained the Soviet standard until the 1970s . It was largely replaced in Soviet service by the 5.45\u00d739mm cartridge , which was introduced with the new AK-74 rifle , and continues in service with the modernized current-issue Russian Armed Forces AK-74M service rifle , as well as the AK-12 rifle . In the 21st century the 7.62\u00d739mm remains a common service rifle chambering , including for newly developed rifles like the AK-15 ."
