As of the end of the 2015 National Leagues , Cork compete in the top division of both sports .

By comparison , Cork has only won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship seven times . Traditionally football is strongest in the western half of the county , with the O'Donovan Rossa club of Skibbereen the only Cork team from outside the city to have an All-Ireland Club Football title . Hurling is the dominant sport in the east , with teams such as Sarsfields and Midleton having won Cork 's club championship multiple times . Naturally , there are exceptions to this rule of thumb , with hurling pockets in football areas and vice versa . One example is Fermoy in east Cork , which has seven Cork football titles to its name .
