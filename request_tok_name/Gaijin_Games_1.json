  "/wiki/WiiWare": "WiiWare was a service that allowed Wii users to download games and applications specifically designed and developed for the Wii video game console made by Nintendo . These games and applications could only be purchased and downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel under the WiiWare section . Once the user had downloaded the game or application , it would appear in their Wii Menu or SD Card Menu as a new channel . WiiWare was a companion to the Virtual Console , which specializes in emulated games originally developed for other systems instead of original games . WiiWare was promoted as an avenue for developers with small budgets to release innovative , original , and smaller-scale games without the cost and risk of creating a title to be sold at retail ( akin to Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Store ) . The development kit cost around US $ 2000 and developers needed to be licensed with and approved by Nintendo . According to Nintendo , the remarkable motion controls will give birth to fresh takes on established genres , as well as original ideas that currently exist only in developers ' minds . Nintendo handled all pricing options for the downloadable games . Like Virtual Console games , WiiWare was purchased using Wii Shop Points . However , unlike Virtual Console games , instruction manuals were stored on the Wii Shop Channel itself . Unlike its portable equivalent DSiWare , WiiWare games are currently unavailable natively via the Nintendo eShop . However , WiiWare games were purchasable and fully playable on the Wii U console - the Wii 's successor - via Wii Mode .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/IOS": "iOS ( formerly iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware . It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company 's mobile devices , including the iPhone , and iPod Touch ; it also powered the iPad prior to the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 . It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android . Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone , iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch ( September 2007 ) and the iPad ( January 2010 ) . As of March 2018 [ update ] , Apple 's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications , 1 million of which are native for iPads . These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times . The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures . Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually .",
  "/wiki/Mac_OS": "The family of Macintosh operating systems developed by Apple Inc. includes the graphical user interface-based operating systems it has designed for use with its Macintosh series of personal computers since 1984 , as well as the related system software it once created for compatible third-party systems . In 1984 , Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the Classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software . The system , rebranded Mac OS in 1996 , was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s . Noted for its ease of use , it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors . The current Mac operating system is macOS , originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016 . Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple 's purchase of NeXT , Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP , a Unix system , that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced . The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually . It is the basis of Apple 's current system software for its other devices - iOS , iPadOS , watchOS , and tvOS . Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X , Apple experimented with several other concepts , releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa , A/UX , MAE , and MkLinux . Apple 's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects , code named Star Trek , Taligent , and Copland . Although they have different architectures , the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI principles , including a menu bar across the top of the screen ; the Finder shell , featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can ; and overlapping windows for multitasking .",
  "/wiki/Nintendo_3DS": "The Nintendo 3DS [ a ] is a handheld game console produced by Nintendo . It is capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D effects without the use of 3D glasses or additional accessories . Nintendo announced the console in March 2010 and officially unveiled it at E3 2010 on June 15 . The console succeeds the Nintendo DS , featuring backward compatibility with older Nintendo DS video games . Its primary competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Vita . The handheld offers new features such as the StreetPass and SpotPass tag modes , powered by Nintendo Network ; augmented reality , using its 3D cameras ; and Virtual Console , which allows owners to download and play games originally released on older video game systems .

The Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan on February 26 , 2011 , and worldwide beginning in March 2011 . Less than six months later on July 28 , 2011 , Nintendo announced a significant price reduction from US $ 249 to US $ 169 amid disappointing launch sales . The company offered ten free Nintendo Entertainment System games and ten free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop to consumers who bought the system at the original launch price . This strategy was considered a major success , and the console went on to become one of Nintendo 's most successful handheld consoles in the first two years of its release . As of December 31 , 2019 [ update ] , the Nintendo 3DS family of systems combined have sold 75.71 million units .",

The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics . The system 's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad , which features an embedded touchscreen , directional buttons , analog sticks , and action buttons . The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to play the game directly on the GamePad . The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative . The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories . Games can support any combination of the GamePad , Wii Remote , Nunchuk , Balance Board , or Nintendo 's Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller . Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse , an integrated social networking service which allows users to share content in game-specific communities . The Wii U was met with a generally positive reception , which included praise for its innovative GamePad controller , improvements to online functionality over the Wii , backwards compatibility with existing Wii software and peripherals , and relative affordability . However , the Wii U was also criticized for the GamePad 's short battery life and issues with the console 's user interface and functionality . The Wii U was met with slow consumer adoption , with low sales that were primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch titles , limited third-party support , and poor marketing .",
  "/wiki/PlayStation_Vita": "The PlayStation Vita ( also known as the PS Vita or simply Vita ) is a handheld video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It was first released in Japan on December 17 , 2011 , and in North America , Europe , and other international territories beginning on February 22 , 2012 . The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",

The console 's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3 , with improved buttons and analog sticks , and an integrated touchpad among other changes . The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia . The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim , with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers ' needs , embracing independent game development , and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One . Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors ; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as significant and obvious . Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales . By the end of September 2019 , over 102 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide , surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3 .

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries ."
