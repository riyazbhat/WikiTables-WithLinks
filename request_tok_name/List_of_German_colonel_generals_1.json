  "/wiki/Oberkommando_des_Heeres": "The Oberkommando des Heeres ( OKH ) was the High Command ( lit . Upper Command ) of the German Army during the Era of Nazi Germany . It was founded in 1935 as a part of Adolf Hitler 's re-militarisation of Germany . From 1938 OKH was , together with OKL ( Oberkommando der Luftwaffe , High Command of the Air Force ) and OKM ( Oberkommando der Marine , High Command of the Navy ) , formally subordinated to the OKW ( Oberkommando der Wehrmacht , High Command of the Armed Forces ) , with the exception of the Waffen-SS . During the war , OKH had the responsibility of strategic planning of Armies and Army Groups , while the General Staff of the OKH managed operational matters . Each German Army also had an Armeeoberkommando , Army Command , or AOK . Until the German defeat at Moscow in December 1941 , OKH and its staff was de facto the most important unit within the German war planning . OKW then took over this function for theatres other than the German-Soviet front . OKH commander held the title Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres ( Supreme Commander of the Army ) . Following the Battle of Moscow , after OKH commander Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was excused , Hitler appointed himself as Commander-in-Chief of the Army .",
  "/wiki/Ludwig_Beck": "Ludwig August Theodor Beck ( 29 June 1880 - 20 July 1944 ) was a German general and Chief of the German General Staff during the early years of the Nazi regime in Germany before World War II . Ludwig Beck never became a member of the Nazi Party , though in the early 1930s he supported Adolf Hitler 's forceful denunciation of the Versailles Treaty and his belief in the need for Germany to rearm . Beck had grave misgivings regarding the Nazi demand that all German officers swear an oath of fealty to the person of Hitler in 1934 , though he believed that Germany needed strong government and that Hitler could successfully provide this so long as the F\u00fchrer was influenced by traditional elements within the military rather than by the SA and SS . In serving as Chief of Staff of the German Army between 1935 and 1938 , Beck became increasingly disillusioned , standing in opposition to the increasing totalitarianism of the Nazi regime and to Hitler 's aggressive foreign policy . Due to public foreign-policy disagreements with Hitler , Beck resigned as Chief of Staff in August 1938 . From this point Beck came to believe that Hitler could not be influenced for good , and that both Hitler and the Nazi party needed to be removed from government . He became a major leader within the conspiracy against Hitler , and would have served as head of state - with the title of either President or regent ( Reichsverweser ) , depending on the source - had the 20 July plot succeeded . However , when the plot failed , Beck was arrested . He reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide , and was then shot dead .",
  "/wiki/German_General_Staff": "The German General Staff , originally the Prussian General Staff and officially Great General Staff ( German : Gro\u00dfer Generalstab ) , was a full-time body at the head of the Prussian Army and later , the German Army , responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war , and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign . It existed unofficially from 1806 , and was formally established by law in 1814 , the first general staff in existence . It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth , and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook . Its rise and development gave the German armed forces a decisive strategic advantage over their adversaries for nearly a century and a half . The Prussian General Staff also enjoyed greater freedom from political control than its contemporaries , and this autonomy was enshrined in law on the unification of Germany and the establishment of the German Empire in 1871 . It came to be regarded as the home of German militarism in the aftermath of World War I , and the victors attempted to suppress the institution . It nevertheless survived to play its accustomed part in the German re-armament and World War II . In a broader sense , the Prussian General Staff corps consisted of those officers qualified to perform staff duties , and formed a unique military fraternity . Their exhaustive training was designed not only to weed out the less motivated or less able candidates , but also to produce a body of professional military experts with common methods and outlook . General Staff-qualified officers alternated between line and staff duties but remained lifelong members of this special organization . Until the end of the German Empire , social and political convention often placed members of noble or royal households in command of its armies or corps but the actual responsibility for the planning and conduct of operations lay with the formation 's staff officers . For other European armies which lacked this professionally trained staff corps , the same conventions were often a recipe for disaster .",
