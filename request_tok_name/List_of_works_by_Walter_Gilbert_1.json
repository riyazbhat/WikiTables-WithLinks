[ a ] Located in the City of Westminster , the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality . It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning . Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen 's House . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 . The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including the East Front , which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds . A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during World War II ; the Queen 's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection . The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle \u00c9poque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House .",

It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building .

  "/wiki/RMS_Lusitania": "RMS Lusitania was a British ocean liner that was sunk on 7 May 1915 by a German U-boat 11 miles ( 18 km ) off the southern coast of Ireland . The sinking presaged the United States declaration of war on Germany two years later . Lusitania held the Blue Riband appellation for the fastest Atlantic crossing and was briefly the world 's largest passenger ship until the completion of her sister ship Mauretania three months later . The Cunard Line launched her in 1906 at a time of fierce competition for the North Atlantic trade . She was sunk on her 202nd trans-Atlantic crossing . German shipping lines were aggressive competitors for the custom of transatlantic passengers in the early 20th century , and Cunard responded by trying to outdo them in speed , capacity , and luxury . Cunard used assistance from the British Admiralty to build Lusitania , on the understanding that the ship would be available as a light merchant cruiser in time of war . She had gun mounts for deck cannons , but no guns were ever installed . Both Lusitania and Mauretania were fitted with revolutionary new turbine engines that enabled them to maintain a service speed of 25 knots ( 46 km/h ; 29 mph ) . They were equipped with lifts , wireless telegraph , and electric light , and provided 50-percent more passenger space than any other ship ; the first-class decks were noted for their sumptuous furnishings . The Royal Navy had blockaded Germany at the start of the First World War ; the UK declared the entire North Sea a war zone in the autumn of 1914 and mined the approaches . In the spring of 1915 , all food imports for Germany were declared contraband .",

In 1839 , Samuel Cunard was awarded the first British transatlantic steamship mail contract , and the next year formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company together with Robert Napier , the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder , to operate the line 's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool-Halifax-Boston route . For most of the next 30 years , Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage . However , in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals , the White Star Line and the Inman Line . To meet this competition , in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company , Ltd , to raise capital . In 1902 , White Star joined the American-owned International Mercantile Marine Co . In response , the British Government provided Cunard with substantial loans and a subsidy to build two superliners needed to retain Britain 's competitive position . Mauretania held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929 . The sinking of her running mate Lusitania in 1915 was one of the causes of the United States ' entering the First World War . In 1919 , Cunard relocated its British homeport from Liverpool to Southampton , to better cater for travellers from London . In the late 1920s , Cunard faced new competition when the Germans , Italians and French built large prestige liners .",

The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements ( the battlecruiser action , the fleet action and the night action ) , from 31 May to 1 June 1916 , off the North Sea coast of Denmark 's Jutland Peninsula . It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war . Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships , following the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904 and the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905 , during the Russo-Japanese War . Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships . Germany 's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out , trap , and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet , as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet . This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British blockade of Germany and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic . Meanwhile , Great Britain 's Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet , thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her shipping lanes . The Germans planned to use Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper 's fast scouting group of five modern battlecruisers to lure Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty 's battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet . They stationed submarines in advance across the likely routes of the British ships . However , the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely , so on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty , passing over the locations of the German submarine picket lines while they were unprepared . The German plan had been delayed , causing further problems for their submarines , which had reached the limit of their endurance at sea .",

It is within the Royal Borough of Greenwich , to which it lends its name . Historically it was in the county of Kent for hundreds of years , then the County of London from 1889 to 1965 . Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian ( 0\u00b0 longitude ) and Greenwich Mean Time . The town became the site of a royal palace , the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century , and was the birthplace of many Tudors , including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I . The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors , designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor . These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873 , and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation . The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public ; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance . The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there , such as Vanbrugh Castle ( 1717 ) established on Maze Hill , next to the park . From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre .
