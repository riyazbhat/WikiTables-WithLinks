On December 2 , 2017 , The New York Times published a front-page story containing detailed accounts of four men in their 40s to 60s alleging their long-term sexual abuse by Levine occurring decades earlier , while each was a music student of his in his teens or early 20s . The following day , the Met suspended Levine and cancelled his future scheduled engagements . The Ravinia Festival also promptly severed all ties with Levine , as did the Boston Symphony Orchestra , which announced that Levine would never again be employed or contracted by the BSO at any time in the future .

  "/wiki/Bass-baritone": "A bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying classical baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice . The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles : the Dutchman in Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder , Wotan/Der Wanderer in the Ring Cycle and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg . Wagner labelled these roles as Hoher Bass ( high bass ) - see fach for more details . The bass-baritone voice is distinguished by two attributes . First , it must be capable of singing comfortably in a baritonal tessitura . Secondly , however , it needs to have the ripely resonant lower range typically associated with the bass voice . For example , the role of Wotan in Die Walk\u00fcre covers the range from F ( the F at the bottom of the bass clef ) to F ( the F above middle C ) , but only infrequently descends beyond C ( the C below middle C ) . Bass-baritones are typically divided into two separate categories : lyric bass-baritone and dramatic bass-baritone . Bass-baritones should not be confused with their vocal cousin - the so-called Verdi baritone . This type of Italianate baritone voice has a brighter tone colour and sings at a slightly higher tessitura than that possessed by the bass-baritone . In addition to the operas of Giuseppe Verdi , its natural home is to be found in operatic music composed after about 1830 by the likes of Donizetti , Ponchielli , Massenet , Puccini and the verismo composers . The term bass-baritone is roughly synonymous with the Italian vocal classification basso cantante ; for example , in the Verdian repertoire , Philip II in Don Carlos is often taken by a bass-baritone , while Ferrando in Il trovatore is sung by a true bass - though the two roles ' ranges are very similar .",
