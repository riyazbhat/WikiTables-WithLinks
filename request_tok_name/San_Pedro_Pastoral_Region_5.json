As of the 2010 census , Bellflower is the 25th most densely populated city in the United States , of cities over 50,000 residents ( and 8th most densely populated in California ) . The city was founded by F.E . Woodruff in 1906 and originally named Somerset in 1909 when the post office was established . However , the Post Office Department rejected the name to prevent confusion with Somerset , Colorado . The present name is derived from the bellflower apple , which was grown in local orchards during the early 1900s . Originally settled by small communities of dairy farmers of Dutch , Japanese , and Portuguese descent , Bellflower and neighboring Paramount served first as the apple and later the milk production centers for Southern California , until soaring post-World War II property values and threatened annexations by Los Angeles led by real-estate syndicates , forced most of the farmers to move several miles east to the Dairy Valley/Dairyland/Dairy City area ( now the cities of Cerritos , La Palma , and Cypress ) . These farms were in turn divided up into large housing divisions for Los Angeles 's growing White American population which worked in the region 's high-tech , skilled industrial , and service positions . From the 1950s through the late 1960s , Bellflower Boulevard , the city 's main thoroughfare , was a thriving commercial strip for shopping . Numerous retail and franchise restaurant firms began on this street , which also featured middle- and high-end boutiques , arts and crafts shops , and other small shopkeeps alongside larger department stores and banks .",
