  "/wiki/Mauthausen_concentration_camp": "Mauthausen was a Nazi concentration camp on a hill above the market town of Mauthausen ( roughly 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) east of Linz , Upper Austria ) . It was the main camp of a group with nearly 100 further subcamps located throughout Austria and southern Germany . The three Gusen concentration camps in and around the village of St Georgen/Gusen , just a few kilometres from Mauthausen , held a significant proportion of prisoners within the camp complex , at times exceeding the number of prisoners at the Mauthausen main camp . The Mauthausen main camp operated from the time of the Anschluss , when Austria was annexed to Nazi Germany on 8 August 1938 , to 5 May 1945 , at the end of the Second World War . Starting with the camp at Mauthausen , the number of subcamps expanded over time and by the summer of 1940 Mauthausen and its subcamps had become one of the largest labour camp complexes in the German-controlled part of Europe . As at other Nazi concentration camps , the inmates at Mauthausen and its subcamps were forced to work as slave labour , under conditions that caused many deaths . Mauthausen and its subcamps included quarries , munitions factories , mines , arms factories and plants assembling Me 262 fighter aircraft . In January 1945 , the camps contained roughly 85,000 inmates . The death toll remains unknown , although most sources place it between 122,766 and 320,000 for the entire complex . Mauthausen was one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in Nazi Germany , and the last to be liberated by the Allies . The two largest camps , Mauthausen and Gusen I , were classed as Grade III ( Stufe III ) concentration camps , which meant that they were intended to be the toughest camps for the incorrigible political enemies of the Reich . Mauthausen never lost this Stufe III classification .",
  "/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp": "The Auschwitz concentration camp ( Konzentrationslager Auschwitz ) was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust . It consisted of Auschwitz I , the main camp ( Stammlager ) in O\u015bwi\u0119cim ; Auschwitz II-Birkenau , a concentration and extermination camp built with several gas chambers ; Auschwitz III-Monowitz , a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben ; and dozens of subcamps . The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers . Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz , 1.1 million died . The death toll includes 960,000 Jews ( 865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival ) , 74,000 non-Jewish Poles , 21,000 Roma , 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war , and up to 15,000 other Europeans . Those not gassed died of starvation , exhaustion , disease , individual executions , or beatings . Others were killed during medical experiments . At least 802 prisoners tried to escape , 144 successfully , and on 7 October 1944 two Sonderkommando units , consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers , launched an unsuccessful uprising .",
  "/wiki/Theresienstadt_concentration_camp": "Theresienstadt ( Czech : Terez\u00edn [ \u02c8t\u025br\u025bzi\u02d0n ] ) was a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto established by the SS during World War II in the fortress town Terez\u00edn , located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia ( a German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia ) . Theresienstadt served two main purposes : it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps , and a retirement settlement for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution . Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners , and the ghetto also served a propaganda role . Unlike other ghettos , the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant . The ghetto was established by a transport of Czech Jews in November 1941 . The first German and Austrian Jews arrived in June 1942 ; Dutch and Danish Jews came beginning in 1943 and prisoners of a wide variety of nationalities were sent to Theresienstadt in the last months of the war . About 33,000 people died at Theresienstadt , mostly from malnutrition and disease . More than 88,000 people were held there for months or years before being deported to extermination camps and other killing sites ; the Jewish self-administration 's role in choosing those to be deported has attracted significant controversy . Including 4,000 of the deportees who survived , the total number of survivors was around 23,000 . Theresienstadt was known for its relatively rich cultural life , including concerts , lectures , and clandestine education for children . The fact that it was governed by a Jewish self-administration as well as the large number of prominent Jews imprisoned there facilitated the flourishing of cultural life . This spiritual legacy has attracted the attention of scholars and sparked interest in the ghetto .",

  "/wiki/Shoah": "The Holocaust , also known as the Shoah , was the World War II genocide of the European Jews . Between 1941 and 1945 , across German-occupied Europe , Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews , around two-thirds of Europe 's Jewish population . The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings ; by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps ; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps , chiefly Auschwitz , Be\u0142\u017cec , Che\u0142mno , Majdanek , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka in occupied Poland . Germany implemented the persecution in stages . Following Adolf Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 , the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed undesirable , starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933 . After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March , which gave Hitler plenary powers , the government began isolating Jews from civil society ; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 . On 9-10 November 1938 , eight months after Germany annexed Austria , Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked , smashed or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as Kristallnacht ( the Night of Broken Glass ) . After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 , triggering World War II , the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews from the rest of the population . Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe . The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question , discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942 . As German forces captured territories in the East , all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized . Under the coordination of the SS , with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party , killings were committed within Germany itself , throughout occupied Europe , and within territories controlled by Germany 's allies .",
  "/wiki/Nicholas_Winton": "Sir Nicholas George Winton , ( born Wertheim ; 19 May 1909 - 1 July 2015 ) was a British humanitarian who established an organization to rescue children at risk from Nazi Germany . Born to German-Jewish parents who had emigrated to Britain , Winton supervised the rescue of 669 children , most of them Jewish , from Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II . Winton found homes for the children and arranged for their safe passage to Britain . This operation was later known as the Czech ( German for children 's transport ) . His work went unnoticed by the world for over 50 years , until 1988 when he was invited to the BBC television programme That 's Life ! , where he was reunited with several of the children that he had saved . The British press celebrated him and dubbed him the British Schindler . In 2003 , Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to humanity , in saving Jewish children from Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia . On 28 October 2014 , he was awarded the highest honor of the Czech Republic , the Order of the White Lion ( 1st class ) , by Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman . He died in 2015 at the age of 106 .",
  "/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp": "Dachau concentration camp ( /\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0xa\u028a/ ; German : Konzentrationslager ( KZ ) Dachau , IPA : [ \u02c8daxa\u028a ] ) was the first of the Nazi concentration camps opened in 1933 , intended to hold political prisoners . It is located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory northeast of the medieval town of Dachau , about 16 km ( 10 mi ) northwest of Munich in the state of Bavaria , in southern Germany . After its opening by Heinrich Himmler , its purpose was enlarged to include forced labor , and , eventually , the imprisonment of Jews , German and Austrian criminals , and finally foreign nationals from countries that Germany occupied or invaded . The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly 100 sub-camps , which were mostly work camps or Arbeitskommandos , and were located throughout southern Germany and Austria . The camps were liberated by U.S. forces on 29 April 1945 . Prisoners lived in constant fear of brutal treatment and terror detention including standing cells , floggings , the so-called tree or pole hanging , and standing at attention for extremely long periods . There were 32,000 documented deaths at the camp , and thousands that are undocumented . Approximately 10,000 of the 30,000 prisoners were sick at the time of liberation . In the postwar years the Dachau facility served to hold SS soldiers awaiting trial . After 1948 , it held ethnic Germans who had been expelled from eastern Europe and were awaiting resettlement , and also was used for a time as a United States military base during the occupation . It was finally closed in 1960 . There are several religious memorials within the Memorial Site , which is open to the public .",
  "/wiki/Winton_Train": "The Winton Train was a private passenger train that travelled from the Czech Republic to Great Britain in September 2009 in tribute to the wartime efforts of Sir Nicholas Winton , described as the 'British Schindler ' for his part in saving refugee children from Czechoslovakia . As a result of Sir Nicholas ' efforts in the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , a total of seven locomotives transported 669 Czechoslovak children of mainly Jewish heritage from Prague to safety in Great Britain . Sir Nicholas ' kindertransport efforts remained largely unrecognised until 1988 , when they came to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details . Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust . As the majority of 'Winton 's Children ' ( as they came to be known ) were Jewish , it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia . As of 2009 , the direct descendants of Winton 's Children numbered over 5000 people . The 2009 tribute Winton Train carried some of the individuals Sir Nicholas arranged to have transported to safety in 1939 , along with their families , as it retraced the original kindertransport route taken by the trains on which they rode as children to safety in Great Britain 70 years earlier . The Winton Train departed on 1 September 2009 , the 70th anniversary of the eighth , and intended last , train arranged by Winton to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day . It departed from Prague Main railway station and travelled through Germany and the Netherlands . After a transfer by ferry to Harwich , the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London 's Liverpool Street station on 4 September , where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself . For the journey across mainland Europe , the train was formed of period carriages and was hauled by historically authentic steam locomotives , while the British leg was hauled by 60163 Tornado , a brand-new , main-line British steam locomotive completed in 2008 , along with carriages that were constructed in the 1950s . The tribute train was the centrepiece of a wider cultural awareness project known as 'Inspiration by Goodness ' , organised by the Czech government .",
