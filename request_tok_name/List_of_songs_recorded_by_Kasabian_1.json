  "/wiki/Heroes_(David_Bowie_song)": "'Heroes ' [ a ] is a song by English musician David Bowie . It was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno , produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti , and recorded in July and August 1977 at Hansa Studio by the Wall . It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his 12th studio album of the same name , backed with the song V-2 Schneider . A product of Bowie 's Berlin period , the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release , but it has since become one of his signature songs . In January 2016 , following Bowie 's death , the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the UK Singles Chart . 'Heroes ' has been cited as Bowie 's second-most covered song after Rebel Rebel . Inspired by the sight of Bowie 's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the Berlin Wall , the song tells the story of two lovers , one from East and one from West Berlin . Bowie 's performance of 'Heroes ' on June 6 , 1987 , at the German Reichstag in West Berlin has been considered a catalyst to the later fall of the Berlin Wall . Following his death in January 2016 , the German government thanked Bowie for helping to bring down the Wall , adding you are now among Heroes . 'Heroes ' has received numerous accolades since its release , as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the greatest songs of all time compiled by the music publications ; Rolling Stone named the song the 46th greatest ever , and NME named it the 15th greatest . Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that 'Heroes ' is perhaps pop 's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity .",
