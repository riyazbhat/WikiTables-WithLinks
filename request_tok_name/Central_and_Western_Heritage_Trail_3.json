Originally the community was mostly Baghdadi and the synagogue was under the superintendence of the Haham of the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation of London : it is now fully independent and has members from across the Jewish diaspora . Most of Hong Kong 's Jews live only a short distance away from the Synagogue , which sits at the junction of Robinson Road and Castle Road . An example of Colonial Sephardic architecture , the two-storied , whitewashed , multi-turreted Synagogue nestles amid the soaring high-rises of steel and glass perched on the Mid-Levels of Hong Kong Island .

It underwent a US $ 6 million restoration in 1998 which returned its interiors and exteriors to their original state . The name Ohel Leah commemorates Leah Sassoon , the mother of the Sassoon brothers Jacob , Edward , and Meyer who donated the land for building the Synagogue . The Sassoons were among the earliest Sephardic merchants from India to settle in Hong Kong during the mid to late 19th century .

He is referred as the Father of the Nation in the Republic of China due to his instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution . Sun is unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for being widely revered in both mainland China and Taiwan . Sun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China , but his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile . After the success of the revolution in which Han Chinese regained power after 268 years of living under the Manchu Qing dynasty , he quickly resigned as President of the newly founded Republic of China and relinquished it to Yuan Shikai . He soon went to exile in Japan for safety but returned to found a revolutionary government in the South as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation . In 1923 , he invited representatives of the Communist International to Canton to re-organize his party and formed a brittle alliance with the Chinese Communist Party . He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor , Chiang Kai-shek in the Northern Expedition . He died in Beijing of gallbladder cancer on 12 March 1925 . Sun 's chief legacy is his political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People : nationalism ( independence from foreign imperialist domination ) , rights of the people ( sometimes translated as democracy ) , and the people 's livelihood ( sometimes translated as socialism , or literally a scientific study of helping people to survive in the society , as he explained the difference between his socialism and that of Karl Marx in his book ) .",
