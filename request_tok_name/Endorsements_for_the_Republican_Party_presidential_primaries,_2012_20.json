That year he became the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , holding the position until 1989 . When Giuliani took office as Mayor of New York City , he appointed a new police commissioner , William Bratton , who applied the broken windows theory of urban decay , which holds that minor disorders and violations create a permissive atmosphere which leads to further and more serious crimes which can threaten the safety of a city ; to prevent major crime , the theory holds , the police should enforce seemingly minor quality-of-life laws such as those outlawing public drinking , littering , and jay-walking . Within several years , Giuliani was widely credited for making major improvements in the city 's quality of life and lowering the rate of violent crimes . While Giuliani was still Mayor , he ran for the United States Senate in 2000 ; however , he withdrew from the race upon learning of his prostate cancer diagnosis .

  "/wiki/Hedge_fund": "A hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited investors or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets , often with complicated portfolio-construction and risk management techniques . It is administered by a professional investment management firm , and often structured as a limited partnership , limited liability company , or similar vehicle . Hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds and regarded as alternative investments , as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators , and distinct from private equity funds , as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets . However , funds which operate similarly to hedge funds but are regulated similarly to mutual funds are available and known as liquid alternative investments . The term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk . Over time , the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded , as did the different types of investment vehicles . Today , hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques . Hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors , and can not be offered or sold to the general public . As such , they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight , bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies , and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds . However , following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 , regulations were passed in the United States and Europe with the intention of increasing government oversight of hedge funds and eliminating certain regulatory gaps . Hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular . They have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management , with assets totaling around $ 3.235 trillion in 2018 .",
