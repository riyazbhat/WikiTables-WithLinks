  "/wiki/Mughal_Empire": "The Mughal Empire or Mogul Empire , was an early-modern empire in South Asia . For some two centuries , the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west , northern Afghanistan in the northwest , and Kashmir in the north , to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east , and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in South India . The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur , a warrior chieftain from what today is Uzbekistan , who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid- and Ottoman empires , to defeat the Sultan of Delhi , Ibrahim Lodhi , in the First Battle of Panipat , and to sweep down the plains of Upper India . The Mughal imperial structure , however , is sometimes dated to 1600 , to the rule of Babur 's grandson , Akbar , This imperial structure lasted until 1720 , until shortly after the death of the last major emperor , Aurengzeb , during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent . Reduced subsequently , especially during the East India Company rule in India , to the region in and around Old Delhi , the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare , it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule , but rather equalized and placated them through new administrative practices , and diverse ruling elites , leading to more efficient , centralised , and standardized rule . The base of the empire 's collective wealth was agricultural taxes , instituted by the third Mughal emperor , Akbar . These taxes , which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator , were paid in the well-regulated silver currency , and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets . The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India 's economic expansion . Burgeoning European presence in the Indian ocean , and its increasing demand for Indian raw- and finished products , created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts . There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite , resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms , textiles , and architecture , especially during the reign of Shah Jahan . Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are : Agra Fort , Fatehpur Sikri , Red Fort , Humayun 's Tomb , Lahore Fort and the Taj Mahal , which is described as , The jewel of Muslim art in India , and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world 's heritage .",

The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as the Chhatrapati and ended in 1818 with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II . The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India . [ note 1 ] The Marathas were a Marathi-speaking warrior group from the western Deccan Plateau ( present-day Maharashtra ) who rose to prominence by establishing a Hindavi Swarajya ( meaning self-rule of Hindu/Indian people ) . The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of Shivaji Maharaj , who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty , and carved out a kingdom with Raigad as his capital . Known for their mobility , the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Mughal-Maratha Wars and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent . After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 , Shahu , grandson of Shivaji , was released by the Mughals . Following a brief struggle with his aunt Tarabai , Shahu became the ruler and appointed Balaji Vishwanath and later , his descendants , as the peshwas or prime ministers of the empire . Balaji and his descendants played a key role in the expansion of Maratha rule . The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south , to Peshawar ( modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan [ note 2 ] ) in the north , and Bengal Subah in the east . The Marathas discussed abolishing the Mughal throne and placing Vishwasrao Peshwa on the Mughal imperial throne in Delhi but were not able to do so . In 1761 , the Maratha Army lost the Third Battle of Panipat against Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire , which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan .",

Following Tipu 's death in the fourth war of 1799 , large parts of his kingdom were annexed by the British , which signalled the end of a period of Mysorean hegemony over southern Deccan .

The city has been controlled by numerous empires throughout the course of its history , including the Hindu Shahis , Ghaznavids , Ghurids , and Delhi Sultanate by the medieval era . Lahore reached the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early 18th century , and served as its capital city for a number of years . The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739 , and fell into a period of decay while being contested between the Afghans and the Sikhs . Lahore eventually became capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century , and regained much of its lost grandeur . Lahore was then annexed to the British Empire , and made capital of British Punjab . Lahore was central to the independence movements of both India and Pakistan , with the city being the site of both the declaration of Indian Independence , and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan .

  "/wiki/Sikh_Empire": "The Sikh Empire ( also Sikh Khalsa Raj or Sarkar-i Khalsa ) was a state originating in the Indian subcontinent , formed under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh , who established a secular empire based in the Punjab . The empire existed from 1799 , when Ranjit Singh captured Lahore , to 1849 and was forged on the foundations of the Khalsa from a collection of autonomous Sikh misls . At its peak in the 19th century , the Empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west to western Tibet in the east , and from Mithankot in the south to Kashmir in the north . Religiously diverse , with an estimated population of 3.5 million in 1831 ( making it the 19th most populous country at the time ) , it was the last major region of the Indian subcontinent to be annexed by the British . The foundations of the Sikh Empire can be traced to as early as 1707 , the year of Aurangzeb 's death and the start of the downfall of the Mughal Empire . With the Mughals significantly weakened , the Sikh army , known as the Dal Khalsa , a rearrangement of the Khalsa inaugurated by Guru Gobind Singh , led expeditions against them and the Afghans in the west . This led to a growth of the army which split into different confederacies or semi-independent misls . Each of these component armies controlled different areas and cities . However , in the period from 1762 to 1799 , Sikh commanders of the misls appeared to be coming into their own as independent warlords . The formation of the empire began with the capture of Lahore , by Maharaja Ranjit Singh , from its Afghan ruler , Zaman Shah Durrani , and the subsequent and progressive expulsion of Afghans from the Punjab , by defeating them in the Afghan-Sikh Wars , and the unification of the separate Sikh misls . Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Punjab on 12 April 1801 ( to coincide with Vaisakhi ) , creating a unified political state . Sahib Singh Bedi , a descendant of Guru Nanak , conducted the coronation .",

The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts . The geographical definition of the term Punjab has changed over time : in the 16th century Mughal Empire it referred to a relatively smaller area lying between the Indus and the Sutlej rivers . In British India , until the Partition of Punjab in 1947 , the Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab , Haryana , Himachal Pradesh , Chandigarh , and Delhi ; and the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory .

  "/wiki/East_India_Company": "The East India Company ( EIC ) , also known as the Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) , East India Trading Company ( EITC ) , or the British East India Company , and informally known as John Company , Company Bahadur , or simply The Company , was an English and later British joint-stock company . It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region , initially with Mughal India and the East Indies , and later with Qing China . The company ended up seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent , colonised parts of Southeast Asia , and colonised Hong Kong after a war with Qing China . Originally chartered as the Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies , the company rose to account for half of the world 's trade , particularly in basic commodities including cotton , silk , indigo dye , salt , spices , saltpetre , tea , and opium . The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India . In his speech to the House of Commons in July 1833 , Lord Macaulay explained that since the beginning , the East India company had always been involved in both trade and politics , just as its French and Dutch counterparts had been . The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600 , coming relatively late to trade in the Indies . Before them the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia had traded there for much of the 16th century and the first of half a dozen Dutch Companies sailed to trade there from 1595 . These Dutch companies amalgamated in March 1602 into the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) , which introduced the first permanent joint stock from 1612 ( meaning investment into shares did not need to be returned , but could be traded on a stock exchange ) . By contrast , wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the EIC 's shares . Initially the government owned no shares and had only indirect control until 1657 when permanent joint stock was established . During its first century of operation , the focus of the company was trade , not the building of an empire in India .",
