Production began in 1995 , when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck . The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh , which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck .

The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox ; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally .

While officially the band still exists , and its well-known name was used in 2001 to promote a 'duel ' album pitting the two labels ' artists against each other , Kool Shen was quoted in 2004 saying on a fini avec NTM en 98 ( We finished with NTM in 1998 ) . The group is known for its gritty , dark and sometimes violent lyrics , as well as for the contrast between the two rappers ' styles . While Joey Starr ( also known as Jaguar Gorgonne and Double-R ) has a relatively slow flow , aggressive lyrics and a deep , booming voice ( which he sometimes uses to yell such as in Pose ton Gun ) , Kool Shen has a funkier flow as well as witty and rather melancholic lyrics .
