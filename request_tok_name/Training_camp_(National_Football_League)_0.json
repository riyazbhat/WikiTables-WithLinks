Before the 1988 season , the team moved west to Tempe , Arizona , a college suburb east of Phoenix , and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University . In 2006 , the club moved to their current home field in Glendale , although the team 's executive offices and training facility remain in Tempe . The franchise has won two NFL championships , both while it was based in Chicago . The first occurred in 1925 , but is the subject of controversy , with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have won the title .

After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation .
