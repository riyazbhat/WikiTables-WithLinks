  "/wiki/Metropolitan_area": "A metropolitan area is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories , sharing industry , infrastructure , and housing . A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities : neighborhoods , townships , boroughs , cities , towns , exurbs , suburbs , counties , districts , states , and even nations like the eurodistricts . As social , economic and political institutions have changed , metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions . Metropolitan areas include satellite cities , towns and intervening rural areas that are socioeconomically tied to the urban core , typically measured by commuting patterns . Most metropolitan areas are anchored by one major city such as Paris metropolitan area ( Paris ) and New York metropolitan area ( New York City ) . In some cases metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance , such as Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area ( Dallas and Fort Worth ) and Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area ( Islamabad and Rawalpindi ) . In the United States , the concept of the metropolitan statistical area has gained prominence . Metropolitan areas may themselves be part of larger megalopolises . For urban centres outside metropolitan areas , that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region , the concept of the regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or regio was introduced by German professors in 2006 . In the United States , the term micropolitan statistical area is used .",

  "/wiki/Demographics_of_Mexico": "With a population of about 126 million in 2019 , Mexico ranks as the 10th most populated country in the world . It is the most populous Spanish-speaking country and the third-most populous in the Americas after the United States and Brazil . Throughout most of the twentieth century Mexico 's population was characterized by rapid growth . Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1% , the demographic transition is still in progress , and Mexico still has a large cohort of youths . The most populous city in the country is the capital , Mexico City , with a population of 8.9 million ( 2016 ) , and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1 million ( 2010 ) . Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country . In total , about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas , meaning that only 21.16% live in rural areas . The Census Inegi in Mexico is the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda ( INEGI ) . The National Population Council ( CONAPO ) , is an institution under the Secretary of the Interior in charge of the analysis and research of population dynamics .

It is surrounded by thin strips of highlands which separate it from other adjacent metropolitan areas , of which the biggest are Puebla , Toluca , and Cuernavaca-Cuautla , and together with which it makes up the Mexico City megalopolis . Since the 1940s there have been different proposals to establish the limits of the growing conurbation of Mexico City , and different definitions were used unofficially as the city continued to grow . The Federal Government ( represented by the Department of Social Development ) , the government of Mexico City , and the government of the State of Mexico agreed on the official definitions for both the Mexico City Metropolitan Area and the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico on December 22 , 2005 . Per the agreement , most urban planning projects will be administered by Metropolitan Commissions .

It is now in transition to become the country 's 32nd federal entity , officially Mexico City ( Spanish : Ciudad de M\u00e9xico , commonly abbreviated as CDMX ) , giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state .
