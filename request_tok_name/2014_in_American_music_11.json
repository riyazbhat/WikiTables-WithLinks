  "/wiki/R&B": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",

  "/wiki/Pop-soul": "Soul music ( often referred to simply as soul ) is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s . It combines elements of African-American gospel music , rhythm and blues and jazz . Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States , where record labels such as Motown , Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement . Soul also became popular around the world , directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa . According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky , secular testifying . Catchy rhythms , stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves , are an important feature of soul music . Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound . The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions , twirls and auxiliary sounds . Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture . The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music , which boasted pride in being black . Soul music dominated the U.S. R & B chart in the 1960s , and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. , Britain and elsewhere . By 1968 , the soul music genre had begun to splinter .",

The current lineup features Corgan , Chamberlin , Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder . Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries , they have a diverse , densely layered , and guitar-heavy sound , containing elements of gothic rock , heavy metal , dream pop , psychedelic rock , progressive rock , shoegazing , and electronica in later recordings . Corgan is the group 's primary songwriter ; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band 's albums and songs , which have been described as anguished , bruised reports from Billy Corgan 's nightmare-land . The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album , 1993 's Siamese Dream . The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up , the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness , debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart .

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",

  "/wiki/Power_pop": "Power pop ( also typeset as powerpop ) is a form of pop rock based on the early music of bands such as the Who , the Beatles , the Beach Boys , and the Byrds . It originated in the late 1960s as young music fans began to rebel against the emerging pretensions of rock music , and developed mainly among American musicians who came of age during the British Invasion . The genre typically incorporates melodic hooks , vocal harmonies , an energetic performance , and happy-sounding music underpinned by a sense of yearning , longing , or despair . The term power pop was coined by the Who 's Pete Townshend in 1967 to describe their style of music . However , the term became more widely identified with subsequent artists from the 1970s who sought to revive Beatles-style pop . The sound of the genre became more established thanks to early 1970s hits by Badfinger , the Raspberries , and Todd Rundgren . Subsequent artists occasionally drew from developments such as new wave , punk , glam rock , pub rock , college rock , and neo-psychedelia . Power pop reached its commercial peak during the rise of punk and new wave in the late 1970s , with Cheap Trick , the Knack , the Romantics , Nick Lowe , Dave Edmunds , and Dwight Twilley . During this time , music critics who wrote about the phenomenon popularized the term 's usage . After a popular and critical backlash to the genre 's biggest-ever hit , My Sharona ( The Knack , 1979 ) , record companies generally stopped signing power pop groups , and most of the 1970s bands broke up in the early 1980s . Over the proceeding decades , power pop continued with modest commercial success while largely remaining an object of critical derision . The 1990s saw a new wave of alternative bands that were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced .",
  "/wiki/Punk_rock": "Punk rock ( or simply punk ) is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s . Rooted in 1960s garage rock , punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock . They typically produced short , fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles , stripped-down instrumentation , and often political , anti-establishment lyrics . Punk embraces a DIY ethic ; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels . The term punk rock was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors . When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976 , acts such as Television , Patti Smith , and the Ramones in New York City ; the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London ; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard . As 1977 approached , punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK . It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment ( such as deliberately offensive T-shirts , leather jackets , studded or spiked bands and jewelry , safety pins , and bondage and S & M clothes ) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies . In 1977 , the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive , spreading worldwide , especially in England . It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the mainstream . In the late 1970s , punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style . By the early 1980s , faster and more aggressive subgenres such as hardcore punk ( e.g .",

  "/wiki/Comedy_hip_hop": "Comedy hip hop or comedy rap , is a subgenre of hip hop music that is comedic in nature , often incorporating satirical lyrics . While many examples of comedy hip hop could be considered a parody of the hip hop genre , in the case of artists who merely incorporate humor into their more serious , purist hip hop styles , such as Eminem and Ludacris , this is not necessarily the case . Run DMC 's Christmas in Hollis from 1987 is comedy rap , and DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince were solidly in the comedy rap genre with the 1988 song Parents Just Do n't Understand . N.W.A and Ice Cube 's early albums were not as comedic and lighthearted as The Fresh Prince but did incorporate humor . Before the darker themes that are characteristic of the Gangsta rap of the 1990s , comedy hip hop , with its lighter and more humorous style , came to prominence in the 1980s , carried by popular acts such as the Beastie Boys . Various influential comedy hip hop groups began in the late 1980s , such as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince , De La Soul , Kid ' n Play , Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens and throughout the late 1990s and 2000s , rappers including Eminem , Ludacris and Afroman gained popularity , as did rappers such as Hopsin . Rucka Rucka Ali is a song artist who experiments with comedy hip hop filled with racism , such as his song , What The Black Says . Weird Al Yankovic has made entries to this music genre , along with Nerdcore . Thrift Shop by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis is also a well-known song of comedy hip hop . While few rappers make comedy hip hop their focus with the exception of a few , mainly Lil Dicky and Ugly God , the genre maintains a substantial loyal following . Outside the English-speaking world , the genre spread in the 1990s , with bands and artists such as the German group Fettes Brot , the Swedish-Finnish artist Markoolio and the French group Svinkels . Especially German hip-hop is known for its frequent use of humorous , satirical and ironic lyrics that sometimes are parodying the heaviness and seriousness of US gangster rap .",
  "/wiki/Synthpop": "Synth-pop ( short for ssynthesizer pop ; also called techno-pop ) is a subgenre of new wave music that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument . It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock , electronic , art rock , disco , and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk . It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s . Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s , while the mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians . After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979 , large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s . In Japan , Yellow Magic Orchestra introduced the TR-808 rhythm machine to popular music , and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts . The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers , the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats , led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop . This , its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement , together with the rise of MTV , led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts in the US during the Second British Invasion . Synth-pop is sometimes used interchangeably with electropop , but electropop may also denote a variant of synth-pop that places more emphasis on a harder , more electronic sound . In the mid to late 1980s , duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a style that was highly successful on the US dance charts , but by the end of the decade , the 'new wave ' synth-pop of bands such as A-ha and Alphaville was giving way to house music and techno . Interest in new wave synth-pop began to revive in the indietronica and electroclash movements in the late 1990s , and in the 2000s synth-pop enjoyed a widespread revival and commercial success . The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship ; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs .",
  "/wiki/Nerdcore": "Nerdcore is a genre of music characterized by themes and subject matter considered to be of general interest to nerds . Self-described nerdcore musician MC Frontalot has the earliest known recorded use of the term ( to describe this genre ) in the 2000 song Nerdcore Hiphop . Frontalot , like most nerdcore artists , self-publishes his work and has released much of it for free online . As a niche genre , nerdcore generally holds to the DIY ethic , and has a history of self-publishing and self-production . Though nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction , there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter , including Star Wars , Internet pornography , role-playing games , science , fantasy and computers . Music with similar themes , but different musical styles can be found in the filk genres . There are hip hop artists who have recorded compositions which focus on similar topics , but who are not generally considered nerdcore . Examples would be Blackalicious , a group which does not claim to be nerdcore , despite science-oriented songs like Chemical Calisthenics , and MF DOOM , who is heavily inspired by comic book supervillains but is generally seen as more conventional hip hop . Conversely , one does not need to concentrate on those topics to be nerdcore : most of the songs by Frontalot do not focus narrowly on stereotypically nerdy topics . The difference is largely one of self-identification ; the group Blackalicious does not identify as nerds , while Frontalot does ."
