Culturally , the Highlands and the Lowlands diverged from the later Middle Ages into the modern period , when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands . The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault , although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined , particularly to the east . The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands . The Scottish Gaelic name of A ' Gh\u00e0idhealtachd literally means the place of the Gaels and traditionally , from a Gaelic-speaking point of view , includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands . The area is very sparsely populated , with many mountain ranges dominating the region , and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles , Ben Nevis . Before the middle of the 19th century the Highlands was home to a much larger population , but from circa 1841 and for the next 160 years , the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration ( mostly to Canada , the United States , Australia and New Zealand , and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England . ) : xxiii , 414 and passim The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe . At 9.1 per km2 ( 23.6 per square mile ) in 2012 , the population density in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland 's as a whole , comparable with that of Bolivia , Chad and Russia . The Highland Council is the administrative body for much of the Highlands , with its administrative centre at Inverness . However , the Highlands also includes parts of the council areas of Aberdeenshire , Angus , Argyll and Bute , Moray , North Ayrshire , Perth and Kinross , Stirling and West Dunbartonshire . The Scottish highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the taiga biome as it features concentrated populations of Scots pine forest : see Caledonian Forest .",
  "/wiki/Caledonian_Forest": "The Caledonian Forest is the name given to the former ( ancient old-growth ) temperate rainforest of Scotland . The Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial ; arriving about 7000 BC . The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC , after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier . This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC . From that date , human actions ( including the grazing effects of sheep and deer ) reduced it to its current extent . Today , that forest exists as 35 remnants , as authenticated by Steven & Carlisle ( 1959 ) ( or 84 remnants , including later subjective subdivisions of the 35 ) covering about 180 square kilometres ( 69 sq mi ) or 44,000 acres ( 18,000 ha ) . The Scots pines of these remnants are , by definition , directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the ice age . These remnants have adapted genetically to different Scottish environments , and as such , are globally unique ; their ecological characteristics form an unbroken , 9000-year chain of natural evolution with a distinct variety of soils , vegetation , and animals . To a great extent the remnants survived on land that was either too steep , too rocky , or too remote to be agriculturally useful . The largest remnants are in Strathspey and Strath Dee on highly acidic , freely drained glacial deposits that are of little value for cultivation and domestic stock . An examination of the earliest maps of Scotland suggests that the extent of the Caledonian Forest remnants has changed little since 1600 .",
