  "/wiki/Scooby-Doo!_Mystery_Incorporated": "Scooby-Doo ! Mystery Incorporated ( also known as Mystery Incorporated or Scooby-Doo !

The series is produced by Warner Bros . Animation and Cartoon Network UK and premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on April 5 , 2010 , with the next twelve episodes continuing , and the first episode re-airing , on July 12 , 2010 . The series concluded on April 5 , 2013 , after two seasons and fifty-two episodes . Mystery Incorporated returns to the early days of Scooby and the gang , when they are still solving mysteries in their home town , though it makes multiple references to previous incarnations of the franchise . The series takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the classic Scooby-Doo formula , with increasingly outlandish technology , skills and scenarios making up each villain 's story , and a different spin on the famous meddling kids quote at the end of every episode . Contrasting sharply with this , however , are two elements that have never been used in a Scooby-Doo series before : a serial format with an ongoing story arc featuring many dark plot elements that are treated with near-total seriousness , and ongoing relationship drama between the characters . Furthermore , it is also the first series in the franchise to make use of real ghosts and monsters since The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo . The series pays homage to the horror genre , drawing on many works from film , television and literature in both parodic and serious ways , from horror movie classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street , modern films such as Saw , television series Twin Peaks , and the works of H. P. Lovecraft , alongside the classic monster horror movies shown in previous series . In particular , in the second season , the central story arc evolves to heavily feature the use of Babylonian mythology , exploring the Anunnaki , the Babylonian and modern pseudo-scientific concepts of Nibiru , and the writings of Zecharia Sitchin .",
