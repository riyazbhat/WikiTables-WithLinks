  "/wiki/Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China": "The flag of the Republic of China ( also known as the Blue Sky , White Sun , and a Wholly Red Earth ) consists of a red field with a blue canton bearing a white disc with twelve triangles surrounding it . The disc and triangles symbolize the sun and rays of light emanating from it respectively . The flag was originally designed by the anti-Qing group , Revive China Society in 1894 with the addition of the red field component in 1906 by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in speech . It was first used in mainland China as the Navy flag in 1912 , and was made the official national flag of the Republic of China ( ROC ) in 1928 by the Kuomintang ( KMT ) . It was enshrined in the sixth article of the Constitution of the Republic of China when it was promulgated in 1947 . The flag is no longer officially used in mainland China , as the People 's Republic of China was founded in 1949 . As the islands of Taiwan and Penghu were under Japanese rule until 1945 , the flag was not in use in two territories , until ROC took control in 1945 . The flag is now mostly used within Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , Matsu and other outlying islands , where the ROC relocated to in 1949 after its defeat in the Chinese Civil War .",

It is located on the southern estuary of the Yangtze , and the Huangpu River flows through it . With a population of 24.2 million as of 2018 [ update ] , it is the most populous urban area in China and the second most populous city proper in the world . Shanghai is a global center for finance , innovation , and transportation , and the Port of Shanghai is the world 's busiest container port . Originally a fishing village and market town , Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location . The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade after the First Opium War . The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established . The city then flourished , becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s . During the Second Sino-Japanese War , the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai . After the war , with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949 , trade was limited to other socialist countries , and the city 's global influence declined . In the 1990s , economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city , especially the Pudong district , aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city . The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance ; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange , one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization , and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone , the first free-trade zone in China .",

The term Huaxia represents the collective Neolithic confederation of agricultural tribes Hua and Xia who settled along the Central Plains around the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern China . The two tribes were the ancestors of the modern Han Chinese people that gave birth to Chinese civilization . In addition , the term Huaxia ( literally the civilized Xia people ) was distinctively used to represent a civilized ethnic group in contrast to what was perceived as barbaric peoples around them .

The 110,000 Dungan people of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are also considered part of the Hui ethnicity . Their culture has distinct differences that developed from the practice of Islam . For example , as Muslims , they follow Islamic dietary laws and reject the consumption of pork , the most common meat consumed in China and have given rise to their own variation of Chinese cuisine . Traditional Hui clothing differs from that of the Han primarily in that some men wear white caps ( taqiyah ) and some women wear headscarves , as is the case in many Islamic cultures . However , since the industrialization and modernization of China , most of the young Hui people wear the same clothes as mainstream fashion trends .",

Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan .

Thus the Provisional Government had nominal authority in Japanese occupied zones in north China , while to the south the Central China Expeditionary Army established the Reformed Government of the Republic of China in 1938 , which had authority in the Yangtze River area .

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire .

The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions .
