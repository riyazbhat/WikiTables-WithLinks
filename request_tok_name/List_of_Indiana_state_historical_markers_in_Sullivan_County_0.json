  "/wiki/Illinois_campaign": "The Illinois campaign , also known as Clark 's Northwestern campaign ( 1778-1779 ) , was a series of events during the American Revolutionary War in which a small force of Virginia militiamen , led by George Rogers Clark , seized control of several British posts in the Illinois Country , in what are now Illinois and Indiana in the Midwestern United States . The campaign is the best-known action of the western theater of the war and the source of Clark 's reputation as an early American military hero . In July 1778 , Clark and his men crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky and took control of Kaskaskia , Vincennes , and several other villages in British territory . The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because most of the Canadien and Native American inhabitants , who peacefully co-existed with one another , were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British Empire . To counter Clark 's advance , Henry Hamilton , the British lieutenant governor at Fort Detroit , reoccupied Vincennes with a small force . In February 1779 , Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town , capturing Hamilton in the process . Virginia capitalized on Clark 's success by establishing the region as Illinois County , Virginia . The importance of the Illinois campaign has been the subject of much debate . Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , some historians have credited Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original Thirteen Colonies by seizing control of the Illinois Country during the war . For this reason , Clark was nicknamed the Conqueror of the Northwest , and his Illinois campaign - particularly the surprise march to Vincennes - was greatly celebrated and romanticized . Other historians have downplayed the importance of the campaign , arguing that Clark 's conquest was a temporary occupation that had no impact on the boundary negotiations in Europe .",
