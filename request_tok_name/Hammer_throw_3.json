The first recorded claim over the land was laid by Denmark in 1219 , after a successful raid of Lyndanisse led by king Valdemar II , followed by a period of alternating Scandinavian and Teutonic rulers . Due to its strategic location , the city became a major trade hub , especially from the 14th to the 16th century , when it grew in importance as part of the Hanseatic League .
