The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S . Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine , despite losing the popular vote . Trump took office as the 45th president , and Pence as the 48th vice president , on January 20 , 2017 . Trump emerged as his party 's front-runner amidst a wide field of Republican primary candidates , while Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders and became the first female presidential nominee of a major American party . Trump 's populist , nationalist campaign , which promised to Make America Great Again and opposed political correctness , illegal immigration , and many free-trade agreements , garnered extensive free media coverage . Clinton emphasized her extensive political experience , denounced Trump and many of his supporters as bigots , and advocated the expansion of President Obama 's policies ; racial , LGBT , and women 's rights ; and inclusive capitalism . The tone of the general election campaign was widely characterized as divisive and negative . Trump faced controversy over his views on race and immigration , incidents of violence against protestors at his rallies , and numerous sexual misconduct allegations including a controversial tape , while Clinton 's campaign was undermined by declining approval ratings due to concerns about her ethics and trustworthiness , and an FBI investigation of her improper use of a private email server , which received more media coverage than any other topic during the campaign . Clinton led in nearly every pre-election nationwide poll and in most swing state polls , leading some commentators to compare Trump 's victory to that of Harry S. Truman in 1948 as one of the greatest political upsets in modern U.S. history . While Clinton received 2.87 million more votes than Trump did ( the largest margin ever for a losing presidential candidate ) , Trump received the majority in the Electoral College and won upset victories in the pivotal Rust Belt region . Trump won six states that Democrat Barack Obama had won in 2012 : Florida , Iowa , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

Reagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states , becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election .

Commoner clearly stated repeatedly that socialism for parts of the economy other than essential infrastructure was a disastrous idea .

He and his allies sought to defuse challenges from other party leaders like James Farley and Vice President John Nance Garner . The 1940 Democratic National Convention re-nominated Roosevelt on the first ballot , while Garner was replaced on the ticket by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace . Willkie , a dark horse candidate , defeated conservative Senator Robert A. Taft and prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey on the sixth presidential ballot of the 1940 Republican National Convention . Roosevelt , acutely aware of strong isolationist and non-interventionism sentiment , promised there would be no involvement in foreign wars if he were re-elected . Willkie , who had not previously run for public office , conducted an energetic campaign and managed to revive Republican strength in areas of the Midwest and Northeast . He criticized perceived incompetence and waste in the New Deal , warned of the dangers of breaking the two-term tradition , and accused Roosevelt of secretly planning to take the country into World War II .
