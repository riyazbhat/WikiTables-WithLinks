  "/wiki/African_National_Congress": "The African National Congress ( ANC ) is the Republic of South Africa 's governing political party . It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa since the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election , winning every election since then . Cyril Ramaphosa , the incumbent President of South Africa , has served as leader of the ANC since 18 December 2017 . Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress ( SANNC ) , its primary mission was to bring all Africans together as one people , to defend their rights and freedoms . This included giving full voting rights to black South Africans and mixed-race South Africans and , from 1948 onwards , to end the system of apartheid introduced by the Nationalist Party government after their election ( by White voters only ) in that year . The ANC originally attempted to use non-violent protests to end apartheid ; however , the Sharpeville massacre in March 1960 , in which 69 black Africans were shot and killed by police and hundreds wounded during a peaceful protest , contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government . On 8 April 1960 , the administration of Charles Robberts Swart banned the ANC in South Africa . After the ban , the ANC formed the Umkhonto we Sizwe ( Spear of the Nation ) to fight against apartheid utilising guerrilla warfare and sabotage . After 30 years of exiled struggle , during which many ANC members had been imprisoned or forced abroad , the country began its move towards full democracy . On 3 February 1990 , State President F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela from prison on 11 February 1990 . On 17 March 1992 , the apartheid referendum was passed by the white only electorate , removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election , which for the first time allowed all South Africans to vote for their national government . Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 55% in all general elections , including the most recent 2019 election .",
