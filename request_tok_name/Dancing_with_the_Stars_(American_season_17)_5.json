Beethoven was born in Bonn , the capital of the Electorate of Cologne , which was part of the Holy Roman Empire . His musical talent was obvious at an early age , and he was harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven , who thought this would enable him to become a child prodigy like Mozart . He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe . At age 21 , he moved to Vienna and studied composition with Joseph Haydn . Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist , and he was soon courted by Karl Alois , Prince Lichnowsky for compositions , which resulted in Opus 1 in 1795 . The piece was a great critical and commercial success and was followed by Symphony No . 1 in 1800 . This composition was distinguished by its frequent use of sforzandi , sudden shifts in tonal centers ( which were uncommon for traditional symphonic form ) , and the prominent , more independent use of wind instruments . In 1801 , he also gained fame for his six String Quartets and for the ballet The Creatures of Prometheus .
