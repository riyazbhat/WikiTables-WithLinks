  "/wiki/Xplorer_(United_States)": "The Xplorer was a named train of the New York Central Railroad ( NYC ) , between Cleveland , Ohio and Cincinnati , Ohio . It was first announced in the April 1956 timetable , however , it was actually introduced in the July timetable . The Xplorer , or Ohio-Xplorer , 423-westbound , 424-eastbound , as it appeared on the company 's timetables , was an attempt by the NYC to modernize intrastate rail travel in Ohio and lure people out of their cars . The train was built by Pullman to their lightweight Train-X design , and was powered by a Baldwin RP-210 Diesel-hydraulic locomotive . The train consisted of nine , short , all-aluminum cars articulated together . The center car had two axles ( one at each end ) , with the remaining cars having a single axle each , being supported by adjacent cars at the end opposite the axle . The ride was rough , as with most of the other lightweight trains of the period , and the train was not a success . As a train , the names Ohio-Xplorer or Xplorer did not reappear on the October 1957 timetable . The equipment was retired in 1960 , and was sold to Jones Tours , for excursion service . After a long period of storage in South Carolina , the train and locomotive were scrapped around 1970 .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Central": "The New York Central Railroad ( reporting mark NYC ) was a railroad primarily operating in the Great Lakes and Mid Atlantic regions of the United States . The railroad primarily connected greater New York and Boston in the east with Chicago and St. Louis in the Midwest along with the intermediate cities of Albany , Buffalo , Cleveland , Cincinnati , and Detroit . New York Central was headquartered in New York City 's New York Central Building , adjacent to its largest station , Grand Central Terminal . The railroad was established in 1853 , consolidating several existing railroad companies . In 1968 the NYC merged with its former rival , the Pennsylvania Railroad , to form Penn Central . Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970 and merged into Conrail in 1976 . Conrail was broken up in 1998 , and portions of its system were transferred to CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway , with CSX acquiring most of the old New York Central trackage . Extensive trackage existed in the states of New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , Illinois , Massachusetts and West Virginia plus additional trackage in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . At the end of 1925 , the NYC operated 11,584 miles ( 18,643 km ) of road and 26,395 miles ( 42,479 km ) of track ; at the end of 1967 the mileages were 9,696 miles ( 15,604 km ) and 18,454 miles ( 29,699 km ) .",

It served mainly as a transcontinental bridge line between Denver , and Salt Lake City , Utah . The Rio Grande was also a major origin of coal and mineral traffic . The Rio Grande was the epitome of mountain railroading , with a motto of Through the Rockies , not around them and later Main line through the Rockies , both referring to the Rocky Mountains . The D & RGW operated the highest mainline rail line in the United States , over the 10,240 feet ( 3,120 m ) Tennessee Pass in Colorado , and the famed routes through the Moffat Tunnel and the Royal Gorge . At its height in the mid-1880s , the D & RG had the largest narrow-gauge railroad network in North America with 2,783 miles ( 4,479 km ) of track interconnecting the states of Colorado , New Mexico , and Utah . Known for its independence , the D & RGW operated the Rio Grande Zephyr until its discontinuation in 1983 . This was the last private intercity passenger train in the United States until Brightline ( now Virgin Trains USA ) began service in Florida in 2018 . In 1988 , the Rio Grande 's parent corporation , Rio Grande Industries , purchased Southern Pacific Transportation Company , and as the result of a merger , the larger Southern Pacific Railroad name was chosen for identity .

  "/wiki/Zephyrette_(train)": "The Zephyrette was a tri-weekly train consisting of a Budd Rail Diesel Car ( RDC ) run by the Western Pacific Railroad between Oakland , California , and Salt Lake City from 1950 to 1960 .

The successor to the Western Pacific 's Royal Gorge as a secondary supplement to the California Zephyr , the Zephyrette began service on September 15 , 1950 . Both the existence and western terminus of the route were shaped by the stipulations of regulatory agencies , while the two RDCs the railroad purchased for the train were substantially modified before entering revenue service . The Zephyrette RDCs achieved considerable cost savings over their conventional predecessor and steam locomotives running similar routes , as well as operational advantages related to their quick acceleration and high cruising speeds . However , they were only temporarily able to keep the service profitable , and the train was ultimately discontinued by the Western Pacific on October 2 , 1960 , just over a decade after its debut .",
