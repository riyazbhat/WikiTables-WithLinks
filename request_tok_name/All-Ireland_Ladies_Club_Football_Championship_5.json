It is one of the constituent counties of Munster GAA . Cork is one of the few 'dual counties ' in Ireland , competing in a similar level in both Gaelic football and hurling . As of the end of the 2015 National Leagues , Cork compete in the top division of both sports . However , despite both teams competing at the top level of the game for most of the county 's history , the hurling team has experienced more success , winning the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 30 times . By comparison , Cork has only won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship seven times . Traditionally football is strongest in the western half of the county , with the O'Donovan Rossa club of Skibbereen the only Cork team from outside the city to have an All-Ireland Club Football title . Hurling is the dominant sport in the east , with teams such as Sarsfields and Midleton having won Cork 's club championship multiple times . Naturally , there are exceptions to this rule of thumb , with hurling pockets in football areas and vice versa . One example is Fermoy in east Cork , which has seven Cork football titles to its name . The city of Cork traditionally has strong teams in both sports , with Nemo Rangers being the record-holders for All-Ireland Club Football Championships won , and Blackrock having three All-Ireland Club Hurling titles . As well as this , the St Finbarr 's club in the city has eight Cork football titles and 25 in hurling .",
