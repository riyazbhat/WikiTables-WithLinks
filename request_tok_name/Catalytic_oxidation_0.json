  "/wiki/Homogeneous_catalysis": "In chemistry , homogeneous catalysis is catalysis in a solution by a soluble catalyst . Homogeneous catalysis refers to catalytic reactions where the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants . Homogeneous catalysis applies to reactions in the gas phase and even in solids . Heterogeneous catalysis is the alternative to homogeneous catalysis , where the catalysis occurs at the interface of two phases , typically gas-solid . The term is used almost exclusively to describe solutions and often implies catalysis by organometallic compounds . Homogeneous catalysis using transition metal complexes is an area of research that has grown enormously in recent years . Many remarkable catalytic discoveries have been reported by researchers both in industry and in academia . The area is one of intense research and many practical applications , e.g. , the production of acetic acid . Enzymes are examples of homogeneous catalysts .",
  "/wiki/Heterogeneous_catalysis": "Heterogeneous catalysis is the type of catalysis where the phase of the catalyst differs from the phase of the reactants or products . Contrasts with homogeneous catalysis where the reactants , products and catalyst exist in the same phase . Phase distinguishes between not only solid , liquid , and gas components , but also immiscible mixtures ( e.g . oil and water ) , or anywhere an interface is present . Catalysts are useful because they increase the rate of a reaction without themselves being consumed and are therefore reusable . Heterogeneous catalysis typically involves solid phase catalysts and gas phase reactants . In this case , there is a cycle of molecular adsorption , reaction , and desorption occurring at the catalyst surface . Thermodynamics , mass transfer , and heat transfer influence the rate ( kinetics ) of reaction . Heterogeneous catalysis is very important because it enables faster , large-scale production and the selective product formation . Approximately 35% of the world 's GDP is influenced by catalysis . The production of 90% of chemicals ( by volume ) is assisted by solid catalysts . The chemical and energy industries rely heavily on heterogeneous catalysis .",

The mineral form of this compound , shcherbinaite , is extremely rare , almost always found among fumaroles . A mineral trihydrate , V2O5\u00b73H2O , is also known under the name of navajoite .",
  "/wiki/Sulfuric_acid": "Sulfuric acid ( alternative spelling sulphuric acid ) , also known as vitriol , is a mineral acid composed of the elements sulfur , oxygen and hydrogen , with molecular formula H2SO4 . It is a colorless , odorless , and viscous liquid that is soluble in water and is synthesized in reactions that are highly exothermic . Its corrosiveness can be mainly ascribed to its strong acidic nature , and , if at a high concentration , its dehydrating and oxidizing properties . It is also hygroscopic , readily absorbing water vapor from the air . Upon contact , sulfuric acid can cause severe chemical burns and even secondary thermal burns ; it is very dangerous even at lower concentrations . Sulfuric acid is a very important commodity chemical , and a nation 's sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength . It is widely produced with different methods , such as contact process , wet sulfuric acid process , lead chamber process and some other methods . Sulfuric acid is also a key substance in the chemical industry . It is most commonly used in fertilizer manufacture , but is also important in mineral processing , oil refining , wastewater processing , and chemical synthesis .

  "/wiki/Ammonia": "Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH3 . A stable binary hydride , and the simplest pnictogen hydride , ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell . It is a common nitrogenous waste , particularly among aquatic organisms , and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers . Ammonia , either directly or indirectly , is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products . It is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water . Although common in nature - both terrestrially and in the outer planets of the Solar System - and in wide use , ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form . It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States , and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce , store , or use it in significant quantities . The global industrial production of ammonia in 2018 was 175 million tonnes , with no significant change relative to the 2013 global industrial production of 175 million tonnes . Industrial ammonia is sold either as ammonia liquor ( usually 28% ammonia in water ) or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders . NH3 boils at \u221233.34 \u00b0C ( \u221228.012 \u00b0F ) at a pressure of one atmosphere , so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature . Household ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is a solution of NH3 in water . The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the Baum\u00e9 scale ( density ) , with 26 degrees Baum\u00e9 ( about 30% ( by weight ) ammonia at 15.5 \u00b0C or 59.9 \u00b0F ) being the typical high-concentration commercial product .",

  "/wiki/Platinum": "Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 78 . It is a dense , malleable , ductile , highly unreactive , precious , silverish-white transition metal . Its name is derived from the Spanish term platino , meaning little silver . Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements . It has six naturally occurring isotopes . It is one of the rarer elements in Earth 's crust , with an average abundance of approximately 5 \u03bcg/kg . It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in South Africa , which accounts for 80% of the world production . Because of its scarcity in Earth 's crust , only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , and given its important uses , it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity . Platinum is one of the least reactive metals . It has remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and is therefore considered a noble metal . Consequently , platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum . Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers , it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts .",
  "/wiki/Nitric_acid": "Nitric acid ( HNO3 ) , also known as aqua fortis ( Latin for strong water ) and spirit of niter , is a highly corrosive mineral acid . The pure compound is colorless , but older samples tend to acquire a yellow cast due to decomposition into oxides of nitrogen and water . Most commercially available nitric acid has a concentration of 68% in water . When the solution contains more than 86% HNO3 , it is referred to as fuming nitric acid . Depending on the amount of nitrogen dioxide present , fuming nitric acid is further characterized as red fuming nitric acid at concentrations above 86% , or white fuming nitric acid at concentrations above 95% . Nitric acid is the primary reagent used for nitration - the addition of a nitro group , typically to an organic molecule . While some resulting nitro compounds are shock- and thermally-sensitive explosives , a few are stable enough to be used in munitions and demolition , while others are still more stable and used as pigments in inks and dyes . Nitric acid is also commonly used as a strong oxidizing agent .",

  "/wiki/Claus_process": "The Claus process is the most significant gas desulfurizing process , recovering elemental sulfur from gaseous hydrogen sulfide . First patented in 1883 by the chemist Carl Friedrich Claus , the Claus process has become the industry standard . C. F. Claus was born in Kassel in the German State of Hessen in 1827 , and studied chemistry in Marburg before he emigrated to England in 1852 . Claus died in London in the year 1900 . The multi-step Claus process recovers sulfur from the gaseous hydrogen sulfide found in raw natural gas and from the by-product gases containing hydrogen sulfide derived from refining crude oil and other industrial processes . The by-product gases mainly originate from physical and chemical gas treatment units ( Selexol , Rectisol , Purisol and amine scrubbers ) in refineries , natural gas processing plants and gasification or synthesis gas plants . These by-product gases may also contain hydrogen cyanide , hydrocarbons , sulfur dioxide or ammonia . Gases with an H2S content of over 25% are suitable for the recovery of sulfur in straight-through Claus plants while alternate configurations such as a split-flow set up or feed and air preheating can be used to process leaner feeds . Hydrogen sulfide produced , for example , in the hydro-desulfurization of refinery naphthas and other petroleum oils , is converted to sulfur in Claus plants . The reaction proceeds in two steps :",
  "/wiki/Sulfur": "Sulfur ( in British English , sulphur ) is a chemical element with the symbol S and atomic number 16 . It is abundant , multivalent , and nonmetallic . Under normal conditions , sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with a chemical formula S8 . Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow , crystalline solid at room temperature . Sulfur is the tenth most common element by mass in the universe , and the fifth most common on Earth . Though sometimes found in pure , native form , sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals . Being abundant in native form , sulfur was known in ancient times , being mentioned for its uses in ancient India , ancient Greece , China , and Egypt . In the Bible , sulfur is called brimstone , which means burning stone . Today , almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum . The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers , and other chemical processes . The element sulfur is used in matches , insecticides , and fungicides . Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous , and the smells of odorized natural gas , skunk scent , grapefruit , and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds .",
  "/wiki/Oil_refinery": "An oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an industrial process plant where crude oil is transformed and refined into more useful products such as petroleum naphtha , gasoline , diesel fuel , asphalt base , heating oil , kerosene , liquefied petroleum gas , jet fuel and fuel oils . Petrochemicals feed stock like ethylene and propylene can also be produced directly by cracking crude oil without the need of using refined products of crude oil such as naphtha . Oil refineries are typically large , sprawling industrial complexes with extensive piping running throughout , carrying streams of fluids between large chemical processing units , such as distillation columns . In many ways , oil refineries use much of the technology , and can be thought of , as types of chemical plants . The crude oil feedstock has typically been processed by an oil production plant . There is usually an oil depot at or near an oil refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil feedstock as well as bulk liquid products . Petroleum refineries are very large industrial complexes that involve many different processing units and auxiliary facilities such as utility units and storage tanks . Each refinery has its own unique arrangement and combination of refining processes largely determined by the refinery location , desired products and economic considerations . An oil refinery is considered an essential part of the downstream side of the petroleum industry . Some modern petroleum refineries process as much as 800,000 to 900,000 barrels ( 127,000 to 143,000 cubic meters ) of crude oil per day . According to the Oil and Gas Journal in the world a total of 636 refineries were operated on the 31 December 2014 for a total capacity of 87.75 million barrels ( 13,951,000 m3 ) .
