  "/wiki/Monty_Python's_Flying_Circus": "Monty Pythons Flying Circus is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring the comedy group Monty Python , consisting of Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam , aka the Pythons . The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September and premiered on 5 October 1969 on BBC1 , with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974 , plus two episodes for German TV . The series stands out for its use of absurd situations , mixed with risqu\u00e9 and innuendo-laden humour , sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines . Live action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam , often merging with the live action to form segues . The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series Q5 , rather than the traditional sketch show format . The Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves , along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland ( referred to by the team as the unofficial Seventh Python ) , Connie Booth ( Cleese 's first wife ) , series producer Ian MacNaughton , Ian Davidson , musician Neil Innes , and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers . The programme came about as the six Pythons , having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s , sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television at the time . Much of the humour in the series 's various episodes and sketches targets the idiosyncrasies of British life , especially that of professionals , as well as aspects of politics . Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual , with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works . The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise , and succeeded ( although , by their perspective , failed ) so completely that the adjective Pythonesque was invented to define it and , later , similar material . However , their humour was not always seen as appropriate for television by the BBC , leading to some censorship during the third series . Cleese left the show following that series , and the remaining Pythons completed a final shortened fourth season before ending the show ."
