  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)": "This article includes a list of countries by their forecasted estimated gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity , abbreviated GDP ( PPP ) . Countries are sorted by GDP PPP forecast estimates from financial and statistical institutions in the limited period January-April 2017 , which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates . The data given on this page are based on the international dollar , a standardized unit used by economists . Certain regions that are not widely considered countries such as the European Union and Hong Kong also show up in the list if they are distinct jurisdiction areas or economic entities . GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing a nation 's domestic market because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods , services and inflation rates of the country , rather than using international market exchange rates which may distort the real differences in per capita income . It is however limited when measuring financial flows between countries and when comparing the quality of same goods among countries . PPP is often used to gauge global poverty thresholds and is used by the United Nations in constructing the human development index . These surveys such as the International Comparison Program include both tradable and non-tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods . The first table includes estimates for the year 2018 for all current 191 International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) members as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan . Data are in millions of international dollars ; they were calculated by the IMF . Figures were published in April 2019 . The second table includes data , mostly for the year 2018 , for 180 of the 193 current United Nations member states as well as Hong Kong and Macau ( the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions ) .",
  "/wiki/World_Bank": "The World Bank ( French : Banque mondiale ) is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects . It comprises of two institutions : the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , and the International Development Association ( IDA ) . The World Bank is a component of the World Bank Group . The World Bank 's most recent stated goal is the reduction of poverty . As of November 2018 , the largest recipients of World Bank loans were India ( $ 859 million in 2018 ) and China ( $ 370 million in 2018 ) , through loans from IBRD .",

  "/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund": "The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is an international organization headquartered in Washington , D.C. , consisting of 189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation , secure financial stability , facilitate international trade , promote high employment and sustainable economic growth , and reduce poverty around the world while periodically depending on the World Bank for its resources . Formed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes , it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system . It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises . Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money . As of 2016 [ update ] , the fund had XDR 477 billion ( about US $ 667 billion ) . Through the fund and other activities such as the gathering of statistics and analysis , surveillance of its members ' economies , and the demand for particular policies , the IMF works to improve the economies of its member countries . The organization 's objectives stated in the Articles of Agreement are : to promote international monetary co-operation , international trade , high employment , exchange-rate stability , sustainable economic growth , and making resources available to member countries in financial difficulty . IMF funds come from two major sources : quotas and loans . Quotas , which are pooled funds of member nations , generate most IMF funds . The size of a member 's quota depends on its economic and financial importance in the world . Nations with larger economic importance have larger quotas . The quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the IMF 's resources in the form of special drawing rights .",
  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)": "Gross domestic product ( GDP ) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year . Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions , which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates . Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries , and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country 's currency . Such fluctuations may change a country 's ranking from one year to the next , even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population . Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) , to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries . PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem , but has its own drawbacks ; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade , does not take into account the differences of quality of goods and services among countries , and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP . On the whole , PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures . The United States is the world 's largest economy with a GDP of approximately $ 20.513 trillion , notably due to high average incomes , a large population , capital investment , low unemployment , high consumer spending , a relatively young population , and technological innovation . Tuvalu is the world 's smallest national economy , with a GDP of about $ 32 million , because of its very small population , a lack of natural resources , reliance on foreign aid , negligible capital investment , demographic problems , and low average incomes . Although the rankings of national economies have changed considerably over time , the United States has maintained its top position since the Gilded Age , a time period in which its economy saw rapid expansion , surpassing the British Empire and Qing dynasty in aggregate output . Since China 's transition to a market-based economy through privatisation and deregulation , the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978 to second to only the United States in 2016 as economic growth accelerated and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 15% in 2016 . India has also experienced a similar economic boom since the implementation of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s .",
  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita": "This page lists the countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product per capita at nominal values . This is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year , converted at market exchange rates to current U.S. dollars , divided by the average population for the same year . The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries , and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country 's currency . Such fluctuations change a country 's ranking from one year to the next , even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population . Therefore , these figures should be used with caution . GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country 's standard of living ; although this is problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income . Comparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) , to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries .

It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",

  "/wiki/Ease_of_Doing_Business_Index": "The ease of doing business index is an index created by Simeon Djankov , an economist at the Central and Eastern Europe sector of the World Bank Group . The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Oliver Hart and Andrei Shleifer . Higher rankings ( a low numerical value ) indicate better , usually simpler , regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights . Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong . An example of such empirical research is a paper on business regulation and poverty , published in Economics Letters . Empirical research is needed to establish the optimal level of business regulation - for example , what the duration of court procedures should be and what the optimal degree of social protection is . The indicators compiled in the Doing Business project allow such research to take place . Since the start of the project in November 2001 , more than 3,000 academic papers have used one or more indicators constructed in Doing Business and the related background papers by its authors .",

The latest report was released on 9 December 2019 and is based on data collected in 2018 . In the 2010 Human Development Report , a further Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index ( IHDI ) was introduced . It stated that while the HDI remains useful , the IHDI is the actual level of human development ( accounting for inequality ) and the HDI can be viewed as an index of potential human development ( or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality ) . The index does not take into account several factors , such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country . This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries , such as the G7 members and others .",
  "/wiki/Human_Development_Index": "The Human Development Index ( HDI ) is a statistic composite index of life expectancy , education , and per capita income indicators , which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development . A country scores a higher HDI when the lifespan is higher , the education level is higher , and the gross national income GNI ( PPP ) per capita is higher . It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian Economist Amartya Sen and was further used to measure a country 's development by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) 's Human Development Report Office . The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index ( IHDI ) . While the simple HDI remains useful , it stated that the IHDI is the actual level of human development ( accounting for inequality ) , and the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential ' human development ( or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality ) . The index does not take into account several factors , such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country . This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries , such as the G7 members and others . The index is based on the human development approach , developed by ul Haq , often framed in terms of whether people are able to be and do desirable things in life . Examples include - Being : well fed , sheltered , healthy ; Doing : work , education , voting , participating in community life . The freedom of choice is central - someone choosing to be hungry ( as during a religious fast ) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they can not afford to buy food , or because the country is in a famine .",
  "/wiki/Human_Poverty_Index": "The Human Poverty Index ( HPI ) was an indication of the poverty of community in a country , developed by the United Nations to complement the Human Development Index ( HDI ) and was first reported as part of the Human Deprivation Report in 1997 . It was considered to better reflect the extent of deprivation in deprived countries compared to the HDI . In 2010 it was supplanted by the UN 's Multidimensional Poverty Index . The HPI concentrates on the deprivation in the three essential elements of human life already reflected in the HDI : longevity , knowledge and a decent standard of living . The HPI is derived separately for developing countries ( HPI-1 ) and a group of select high-income OECD countries ( HPI-2 ) to better reflect socio-economic differences and also the widely different measures of deprivation in the two groups",
  "/wiki/Poverty": "Poverty is not having enough material possessions or income for a person 's needs . Poverty may include social , economic , and political elements . Absolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs , such as food , clothing and shelter . The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is always about the same , independent of the person 's permanent location or era . On the other hand , relative poverty occurs when a person can not meet a minimum level of living standards , compared to others in the same time and place . Therefore , the threshold at which relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another , or from one society to another . For example , a person who can not afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes , but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields ( for example , in a nomadic tribe ) . Governments and non-governmental organizations try to reduce poverty . Providing basic needs to people who are unable to earn a sufficient income can be hampered by constraints on government 's ability to deliver services , such as corruption , tax avoidance , debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals . Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare , economic freedoms and providing financial services .",
  "/wiki/National_wealth": "National net wealth , also known as national net worth , is the total sum of the value of a nation 's assets minus its liabilities . It refers to the total value of net wealth possessed by the citizens of a nation at a set point in time . This figure is an important indicator of a nation 's ability to take on debt and sustain spending and is influenced not only by real estate prices , equity market prices , exchange rates , liabilities and incidence in a country of the adult population , but also human resources , natural resources and capital and technological advancements , which may create new assets or render others worthless in the future . The most significant component by far among most developed nations is commonly reported as household net wealth or worth and reflects infrastructure investment . National wealth can fluctuate , as evidenced in the United States data following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent economic recovery . During periods when equity markets experienced strong growth , the relative national and per capita wealth of the countries where people are more exposed on those markets , such as the United States and United Kingdom , tend to rise . On the other hand , when equity markets are depressed , the relative wealth the countries where people invest more in real estate or bonds , such as France and Italy , tend to rise instead .",
  "/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality": "This is a list of countries or dependencies by income inequality metrics , including Gini coefficients . The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1 , where 0 corresponds with perfect equality ( where everyone has the same income ) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality ( where one person has all the income - and everyone else has no income ) . Income distribution can vary greatly from wealth distribution in a country ( see List of countries by distribution of wealth ) . Income from black market economic activity is not included and is the subject of current economic research .",
  "/wiki/Gini_coefficient": "In economics , the Gini coefficient ( /\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0ni/ JEE-nee ) , sometimes called the Gini index or Gini ratio , is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation 's residents , and is the most commonly used measurement of inequality . It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper Variability and Mutability ( Italian : Variabilit\u00e0 e mutabilit\u00e0 ) . The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution ( for example , levels of income ) . A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality , where all values are the same ( for example , where everyone has the same income ) . A Gini coefficient of one ( or 100% ) expresses maximal inequality among values ( e.g. , for a large number of people , where only one person has all the income or consumption , and all others have none , the Gini coefficient will be very nearly one ) . For larger groups , values close to one are very unlikely in practice . Given the normalization of both the cumulative population and the cumulative share of income used to calculate the Gini coefficient , the measure is not overly sensitive to the specifics of the income distribution , but rather only on how incomes vary relative to the other members of a population . The exception to this is in the redistribution of income resulting in a minimum income for all people . When the population is sorted , if their income distribution were to approximate a well-known function , then some representative values could be calculated . The Gini coefficient was proposed by Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth . For OECD countries , in the late 20th century , considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments , the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49 , with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest . African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008-2009 , with South Africa the world 's highest , variously estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7 , although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account , and drops again to 0.47 after taxation .",

Inflation rate is defined as the annual percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year 's consumer prices . The list is based on the CIA World Factbook data unless otherwise indicated , and is updated according to the statistical updates by respective cities .",
  "/wiki/Inflation": "In economics , inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . When the general price level rises , each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services ; consequently , inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money - a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy . The opposite of inflation is deflation , a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services . The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate , the annualized percentage change in a general price index , usually the consumer price index , over time . Economists generally believe that very high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply . Views on which factors determine low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied . Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services , or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities . However , the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth . Inflation affects economies in various positive and negative ways . The negative effects of inflation include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money , uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings , and if inflation were rapid enough , shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future . Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity , allowing the central bank more leeway in carrying out monetary policy , encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding , and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation . Today , most economists favor a low and steady rate of inflation ."
