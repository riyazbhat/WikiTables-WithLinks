Its population is approximately 800,000 people . Aden 's natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano , which now forms a peninsula joined to the mainland by a low isthmus . This harbour , Front Bay , was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC . The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula . Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden . Aden consists of a number of distinct sub-centres : Crater , the original port city ; Ma'alla , the modern port ; Tawahi , known as Steamer Point in the colonial period ; and the resorts of Gold Mohur . Khormaksar , located on the isthmus that connects Aden proper with the mainland , includes the city 's diplomatic missions , the main offices of Aden University , and Aden International Airport ( the former British Royal Air Force station RAF Khormaksar ) , Yemen 's second biggest airport . On the mainland are the sub-centres of Sheikh Othman , a former oasis area ; Al-Mansura , a town planned by the British ; and Madinat ash-Sha ' b ( formerly Madinat al-Itihad ) , the site designated as the capital of the South Arabian Federation and now home to a large power/desalinization facility and additional faculties of Aden University . Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast , natural harbour that comprises the modern port . This city is rather large , yet has no natural resources available in it .

It was also referred to as Democratic Yemen or Yemen ( Aden ) . South Yemen 's origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate , which consisted of two-thirds of the present-day Yemen . However , Aden became a province within the British Raj in 1937 . After the collapse of Aden Protectorate , a state of emergency was declared in 1963 when the National Liberation Front ( NLF ) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen ( FLOSY ) rebelled against British rule . The Federation of South Arabia and the Protectorate of South Arabia merged to become the People 's Republic of Southern Yemen on 30 November 1967 and became a Marxist-Leninist one-party state in 1970 supported by the Soviet Union . It was the only communist state to be established in the Arab world . Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region , it was involved in a brief civil war in 1986 . With the collapse of communism , South Yemen was unified with the Yemen Arab Republic ( commonly known as North Yemen ) on 22 May 1990 , to form the present-day Yemen . After four years , however , South Yemen declared its secession from the north , which resulted in the north occupying south Yemen and the 1994 civil war .

Remote areas of northern Burma were for many years controlled by an army of Kuomintang ( KMT ) forces after the Communist victory in China in 1949 . Burma accepted foreign assistance in rebuilding the country in these early years , but continued American support for the Chinese Nationalist military presence in Burma finally resulted in the country rejecting most foreign aid , refusing to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation ( SEATO ) and supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955 . Burma generally strove to be impartial in world affairs and was one of the first countries in the world to recognise Israel and the People 's Republic of China . By 1958 , the country was largely beginning to recover economically , but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the Anti-Fascist People 's Freedom League ( AFPFL ) into two factions , one led by Thakins Nu and Tin , the other by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein . And this despite the unexpected success of U Nu 's 'Arms for Democracy ' offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan , the Pa ' O , some Mon and Shan groups , but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms . The situation became very unstable in parliament , with U Nu surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front ( NUF ) , believed to have 'cryptocommunists ' amongst them . Army hardliners now saw the 'threat ' of the CPB coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF , and in the end U Nu 'invited ' Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over the country . Over 400 'communist sympathisers ' were arrested , of which 153 were deported to the Coco Islands in the Andaman Sea . Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than , older brother of Aung San . The Botataung , Kyemon and Rangoon Daily were also closed down . Ne Win 's caretaker government successfully stabilised the situation and paved the way for new general elections in 1960 that returned U Nu 's Union Party with a large majority .",

It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark . The islands have a total area of about 1,400 square kilometres ( 540 sq mi ) with a population of 51,783 as of June 2019 [ update ] . The terrain is rugged ; the climate is subpolar oceanic climate ( Cfc ) - windy , wet , cloudy , and cool . Temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream . As a result of the moderation and the northerly latitude , summers normally hover around 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) . Average temperatures are 5 \u00b0C ( 41 \u00b0F ) in winter . The northerly latitude location also results in perpetual civil twilight during summer nights and very short winter days . Between 1035 and 1814 the Faroes were part of the Kingdom of Norway , which was in a personal union with Denmark from 1450 . In 1814 the Treaty of Kiel transferred Norway to the king of Sweden , on the winning side of the Napoleonic wars , whereas the king of Denmark , on the losing side , retained the Faroes , along with the two other historical Norwegian island possessions in the North Atlantic : Greenland and Iceland . The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948 . The Faroese control most of their domestic affairs .",

  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves . Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature , with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary ( Itin . Marit . p. 518 ; Sil . Ital .",

It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark . Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America , Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe ( specifically Norway and Denmark , the colonial powers , as well as the nearby island of Iceland ) for more than a millennium . The majority of its residents are Inuit , whose ancestors migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada , gradually settling across the island by the 13th century . Nowadays , the population is largely concentrated on the southwest coast , while the rest of the island is sparsely populated . Greenland is divided into five municipalities - Sermersooq , Kujalleq , Qeqertalik , Qeqqata , and Avannaata . It has two unincorporated areas - the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Thule Air Base . The last one , even if under Danish control , is administered by the United States Air Force . Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica . With a population of about 56,480 ( 2013 ) , it is the least densely populated territory in the world . About a third of the population lives in Nuuk , the capital and largest city . The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland , connecting the various cities and settlements .",

Also , minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil , and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian . Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though regional variants of the standard language exist . The main differences in language are between generations , with youth language being particularly innovative .",

It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada , such as Inuktitut . The main variety , Kalaallisut , or West Greenlandic , has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009 ; this is a move by the Naalakkersuisut ( government of Greenland ) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language , Danish . The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat , or East Greenlandic . The Thule Inuit of Greenland , Inuktun or Polar Eskimo , is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut . Greenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes . Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative , meaning that it treats ( i.e . case-marks ) the argument ( subject ) of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb , but distinctly from the agent ( subject ) of a transitive verb .

Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders .

However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 .

The Federation was established on 1 August 1953 , with a Governor-General as the Queen 's representative at the centre . An interesting and novel feature was the African Affairs Board , set up to safeguard the interests of Africans and endowed with statutory powers for that purpose , particularly in regard to discriminatory legislation . The constitutional status of the three territories - a self-governing Colony and two Protectorates - was not affected , though certain enactments applied to the Federation as a whole as if it were part of Her Majesty 's dominions and a Colony . The economic advantages to the Federation were never seriously called into question , and the causes of the Federation 's failure were purely political : the strong and growing opposition of the African inhabitants . The rulers of the new black African states were united in wanting to end colonialism in Africa . With most of the world moving away from colonialism during the late 1950s and early 1960s , the United Kingdom was subjected to pressure to de-colonise from both the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) . These groups supported the aspirations of the black African nationalists and accepted their claims to speak on behalf of the people . The federation officially ended on 31 December 1963 .

With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometers ( 68,000 sq mi ) , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America , after Suriname . Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4,000 years before the Portuguese established Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento in 1680 ; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans relatively late compared with neighboring countries . Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain , and later Argentina and Brazil . It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government . Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy , peace , low perception of corruption , e-government , and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom , size of the middle class and prosperity .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_language": "Spanish ( /\u02c8sp\u00e6n\u026a\u0283/ ( listen ) ; espa\u00f1ol ( help\u00b7info ) ) , or Castilian ( /k\u00e6\u02c8st\u026ali\u0259n/ ( listen ) , castellano ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula and today has over 483 million native speakers , mainly in Spain and the Americas . It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",
  "/wiki/Southern_Rhodesia": "The Colony of Southern Rhodesia was a self-governing British Crown colony in southern Africa . It was the predecessor state of what is now Zimbabwe . The colony was established in 1923 , having earlier been administered by the British South Africa Company . In 1953 , it was merged into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland , which lasted until 1963 . Southern Rhodesia then remained a de jure British colony until 1980 . However , the white-minority government issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI ) in 1965 and established Rhodesia , an unrecognised state . In 1979 , it reconstituted itself under indigenous African rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia , which also failed to win overseas recognition . After a period of interim British control following the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979 , the country achieved internationally recognised independence as Zimbabwe in April 1980 ."
