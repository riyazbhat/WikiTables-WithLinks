Its range included the luxury variants , Holden Berlina ( VE ) and Holden Calais ( VE ) ; utility models were included as the Holden Ute ( VE ) . As opposed to the VZ and all models previous which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market , the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia . Despite its status as an all-new model , engines - comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8 - have been largely carried over from the VZ series . Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs , such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever , facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive . Internationally , the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina , Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8 . Holden implemented a staged roll-out of the VE variants , releasing the sedan first in July 2006 . Prior to this , Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores until the new station wagon and utility body styles were launched . Variants by Holden 's performance vehicle partner , Holden Special Vehicles ( HSV ) , were released soon after the sedan 's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models . The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept .
