He continued the social , economic and cultural reforms begun by his father , King Anawrahta . Pagan became an internationally recognized power during his 28-year reign . The Burmese language and culture continued to gain ground . In his early life , Kyansittha was a popular and successful general who led Anawrahta 's major military campaigns that founded the Pagan Empire . He was exiled twice in the 1070s and 1080s for his affair with Queen Manisanda . Kyansittha ascended to the Pagan throne in 1084 after suppressing a major Mon rebellion that killed King Saw Lu . His reign was largely peaceful . A great admirer of Mon culture , he pursued a conciliatory policy towards the Mon of the south , and continued the patronage of Mon language and culture at his court . It was in his reign that the synthesis of Burman , Mon , Pyu and Buddhist practices into a Burmese cultural tradition began to reach a level of maturity . The Burmese script began to be used alongside Pyu , Mon , and Pali . A peaceful Pagan grew wealthy from agriculture and trade , and large scale temple building began in earnest .",

The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people , the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant . The thousand-year period , often referred to as the Pyu millennium , linked the Bronze Age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Kingdom emerged in the late 9th century . The city-states - five major walled cities and several smaller towns have been excavated - were all located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma : the Mu River Valley , the Kyaukse plains and Minbu region , around the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers . Part of an overland trade route between China and India , the Pyu realm gradually expanded south . Halin , founded in the 1st century AD at the northern edge of Upper Burma , was the largest and most important city until around the 7th or 8th century when it was superseded by Sri Ksetra ( near modern Pyay ) at the southern edge . Twice as large as Halin , Sri Ksetra was the largest and most influential Pyu centre . The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India , importing Buddhism as well as other cultural , architectural and political concepts , which would have an enduring influence on the Culture of Burma and political organisation . The Pyu calendar , based on the Buddhist calendar , later became the Burmese calendar . Recent scholarship , though yet not settled , suggests that the Pyu script , based on the Indian Tamil language Brahmi script , may have been the source of the Burmese script used to write the Burmese language . The millennium-old civilisation came crashing down in the 9th century when the city-states were destroyed by repeated invasions from the Kingdom of Nanzhao . The Bamar people , who came from Nanzhao , set up a garrison town at Bagan at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers .",

Considered the father of the Burmese nation , Anawrahta turned a small principality in the dry zone of Upper Burma into the first Burmese Empire that formed the basis of modern-day Burma ( Myanmar ) . Historically verifiable Burmese history begins with his accession to the Pagan throne in 1044 . Anawrahta unified the entire Irrawaddy valley for the first time in history , and placed peripheral regions such as the Shan States and Arakan ( Rakhine ) under Pagan 's suzerainty . He successfully stopped the advance of Khmer Empire into Tenasserim coastline and into Upper Menam valley , making Pagan one of two main kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia . A strict disciplinarian , Anawrahta implemented a series of key social , religious and economic reforms that would have a lasting impact in Burmese history . His social and religious reforms later developed into the modern-day Burmese culture . By building a series of weirs , he turned parched , arid regions around Pagan into the main rice granaries of Upper Burma , giving Upper Burma an enduring economic base from which to dominate the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery in the following centuries . He bequeathed a strong administrative system that all later Pagan kings followed until the dynasty 's fall in 1287 . The success and longevity of Pagan 's dominance over the Irrawaddy valley laid the foundation for the ascent of Burmese language and culture , the spread of Burman ethnicity in Upper Burma . Anawrahta 's legacy went far beyond the borders of modern Burma . His embrace of Theravada Buddhism and his success in stopping the advance of Khmer Empire , a Hindu state , provided the Buddhist school , which had been in retreat elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia , a much needed reprieve and a safe shelter .",

Manuha ruled Thaton from 1030s until 1057 when he was defeated by King Anawrahta of Pagan Kingdom . :150 According to the Mon tradition , Manuha was the 59th in the line of kings who supposedly founded Thaton during the time of the Buddha in the 6th century BCE . Traditional Burmese and Mon reconstructions also hold that Anawrahta , a recent convert to Theravada Buddhism , asked for the Theravada Buddhist canon from Manuha . The Mon king reputedly rejected Anawrahta 's request , saying that the uncultured Burmans of the north were not worthy of the religion . This refusal was used by Anawrahta as pretense to invade and conquer the Mon kingdom . Despite this account , it is more likely Anawrahta conquered Thaton in order to check the westward advance of Khmer Empire in the Tenasserim coast . Still according to traditional belief , Manuha and his family along with some 30,000 monks and artisans , were brought back to Pagan ( Bagan ) . Between 1050 and about 1085 , Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan , the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat . However , recent research - still a minority view - argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta 's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend , and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan 's expansion .

This movement added a further set of discourses , and although it was initially small in India , it had long-term historical significance . The Buddhist tradition of Vajrayana is sometimes classified as a part of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism , but some scholars consider it to be a different branch altogether . Mah\u0101y\u0101na also refers to the path of the Bodhisattva seeking complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings , also called Bodhisattvay\u0101na , or the Bodhisattva Vehicle . [ note 1 ] A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksa\u1e43buddha ( \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 ) , or fully enlightened Buddha . A samyaksa\u1e43buddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment . Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists teach that enlightenment can be attained in a single lifetime , and this can be accomplished even by a layperson . The Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today , with 53% of practitioners , compared to 36% for Theravada and 6% for Vajrayana in 2010 . In the course of its history , Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism spread from India to various other South , East and Southeast Asian countries such as Bangladesh , Nepal , Bhutan , China , Taiwan , Mongolia , Korea , Japan , Vietnam , Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore . Mahayana Buddhism also spread to other South and Southeast Asian countries , such as Afghanistan , Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , the Maldives , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Burma , Iran and other Central Asian countries before being replaced by Theravada Buddhism , Islam , or other religions . Large Mah\u0101y\u0101na scholastic centers such as Nalanda thrived during the latter period of Buddhism in India , between the seventh and twelfth centuries .
