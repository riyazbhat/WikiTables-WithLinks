  "/wiki/Unchained_Melody": "Unchained Melody is a 1955 song with music by Alex North and lyrics by Hy Zaret . North wrote the music as a theme for the little-known prison film Unchained ( January 1955 ) , hence the song title . Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack . It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century , most notably by the Righteous Brothers . According to the song 's publishing administrator , over 1,500 recordings of Unchained Melody have been made by more than 670 artists , in multiple languages . In 1955 , three versions of the song ( by Les Baxter , Al Hibbler , and Roy Hamilton ) charted in the Billboard Top 10 in the United States , and four versions ( by Al Hibbler , Les Baxter , Jimmy Young , and Liberace ) appeared in the Top 20 in the United Kingdom simultaneously , an unbeaten record for any song . The song continued to chart in the 21st century , and it was the only song to reach number one with four different recordings in the UK until it was joined by Band Aid 30 's Do They Know It 's Christmas ? in 2014 . Of the hundreds of recordings made , the Righteous Brothers ' version in July 1965 , with a solo by Bobby Hatfield , became the jukebox standard after its release . Hatfield changed the melody in the final verse and many subsequent covers of the song are based on his version . The Righteous Brothers recording achieved a second round of great popularity when featured in the film Ghost in 1990 . In 2004 , it was Number 27 on AFI 's 100 Years.100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema .",
  "/wiki/The_Righteous_Brothers": "The Righteous Brothers were originally an American musical duo of Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield . They began performing together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours , but adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they embarked on their recording career as a duo . Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and 70s , and although the duo was inactive for some years , Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield 's death in 2003 . Their emotive vocal style is sometimes dubbed blue-eyed soul . Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges , which helped them to create a distinctive sound as a duet , but also strong vocal talent individually that allowed them to perform as soloists . Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice , with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his tenor voice . They had their first major hit with the 1964 song You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' , produced by Phil Spector and often considered one of his finest works . Other notable hits include Ebb Tide , Soul and Inspiration , Rock and Roll Heaven , and in particular , their version of Unchained Melody . Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers . In 2016 , Medley re-formed The Righteous Brothers with Bucky Heard and they continue to perform as a duo .",
