It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Wesleyanism": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",

Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",

The name derives from the north Indian town of Bareilly , the hometown of its founder and main leader Ahmed Raza Khan ( 1856-1921 ) . Although Barelvi is the commonly used term , the followers of the movement often prefer to be known by the title of Ahle Sunnat wa Jama'at , ( Urdu : \u0627\u06c1\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u062a ) or as Sunnis , a reference to their perception as forming an international majority movement .

Its name comes from the word sunnah , referring to the behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance , as well as theological and juridical dimensions . According to Sunni traditions , Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph . This contrasts with the Shia view , which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor , most notably at Ghadir Khumm . Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism . The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jam\u0101\u02bbah ( the people of the sunnah and the community ) or ahl as-sunnah for short . In English , its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism , while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims , Sunnis , Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah . Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as orthodox Islam , though some scholars view this translation as inappropriate . The Quran , together with hadith ( especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah ) and binding juristic consensus , form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam . Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources , in conjunction with analogical reasoning , consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion , using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools .

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Crossing_(architecture)": "A crossing , in ecclesiastical architecture , is the junction of the four arms of a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) church . In a typically oriented church ( especially of Romanesque and Gothic styles ) , the crossing gives access to the nave on the west , the transept arms on the north and south , and the choir , as the first part of the chancel , on the east . The crossing is sometimes surmounted by a tower or dome . A large crossing tower is particularly common on English Gothic cathedrals . With the Renaissance , building a dome above the crossing became popular . Because the crossing is open on four sides , the weight of the tower or dome rests heavily on the corners ; a stable construction thus required great skill on the part of the builders . In centuries past , it was not uncommon for overambitious crossing towers to collapse . Sacrist Alan of Walsingham 's octagon , built between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of Ely 's nave crossing on 22 February 1322 , is the . greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral according to architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner . A tower over the crossing may be called a lantern tower if it has openings through which light from outside can shine down to the crossing . In Early Medieval churches , the crossing square was often used as a module , or a unit of measurement . The nave and transept would have lengths that were a certain multiple of the length of the crossing square .",

  "/wiki/Edward_Banks_(builder)": "Sir Edward Banks ( 4 January 1770 - 5 July 1835 ) was an English civil engineer and pioneer of steam ships . Born at Hutton Hang near Richmond , North Yorkshire . After spending two years at sea , Banks began as a day labourer in 1789 . He worked under the engineer John Rennie the Elder on the Lancaster Canal and Ulverston Canal and rose to the chief control in his partnership Jolliffe & Banks , contractors for public works . Banks and Jolliffe were responsible for building bridges , dockyards , lighthouses and prisons . Among his undertakings were Staines bridge , the naval works at Sheerness dockyard , and the new channels for the rivers Ouse , Nene , and Witham in Norfolk and Lincolnshire . They were the builders of the Waterloo , Southwark , and London bridges . He owed his fortune principally to these contracts , which he took under the nominal superintendence of the Rennies . Edward Banks first married in 1793 to Nancy Franklin with whom he had five sons and three daughters . She died in 1815 and Banks married again in 1821 to Amalia Pytches , William John Joliffe 's sister in law . Banks lived in Adelphi Terrace , Westminster . He also owned rural estates centred on Oxney Court , Dover and Sheppey Court , Kent .",

  "/wiki/River_Mole": "The River Mole is a tributary of the River Thames in southern England . It rises in West Sussex near Horsham and flows northwest through Surrey for 80 km ( 50 miles ) to the Thames at East Molesey , opposite Hampton Court Palace . The river gives its name to the Surrey district of Mole Valley . The Mole crosses the North Downs between Dorking and Leatherhead , where it cuts a steep-sided valley , known as the Mole Gap , through the chalk . Much of the catchment area lies on impermeable rock ( including Wealden Clay and London Clay ) , meaning that the river level responds rapidly to heavy rainfall . During the second half of the 20th century pollution levels in the river were high ; however , since 1995 the water quality has improved dramatically and the Mole now boasts the greatest diversity of fish species of any river in England . Twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) that include wetland habitats are located within the Mole catchment area , and the stretch of river through Leatherhead has been designated a Local Nature Reserve . The Mole Gap forms part of a Special Area of Conservation and is an SSSI of European importance . The river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets , particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between Dorking and Leatherhead ( most recently during the 1976 drought ) . In John Speed 's 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend The river runneth under . However the river 's name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour : The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names suggests that Mole either comes from the Latin mola ( a mill ) or is a back-formation from Molesey ( Mul 's island ) . Domesday Book lists twenty mills on the river in 1086 , of which Sidlow Mill was the oldest , dating from Saxon times .",
  "/wiki/English_Reformation": "The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th-century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church . These events were , in part , associated with the wider European Protestant Reformation , a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across western and central Europe . Causes included the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible , and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars , the upper and middle classes and readers in general . However , the various phases of the English Reformation , which also covered Wales and Ireland , were largely driven by changes in government policy , to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself . Based on Henry VIII 's desire for an annulment of his marriage ( first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527 ) , the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute . The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes to come to the fore . Until the break with Rome , it was the Pope and general councils of the church that decided doctrine . Church law was governed by canon law with final jurisdiction in Rome . Church taxes were paid straight to Rome , and the Pope had the final word in the appointment of bishops . The break with Rome was effected by a series of acts of Parliament passed between 1532 and 1534 , among them the 1534 Act of Supremacy , which declared that Henry was the Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England . ( This title was renounced by Mary I in 1553 in the process of restoring papal jurisdiction ; when Elizabeth I reasserted the royal supremacy in 1559 , her title was Supreme Governor . ) Final authority in doctrinal and legal disputes now rested with the monarch , and the papacy was deprived of revenue and the final say on the appointment of bishops .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",

  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Portal_frame": "Portal frame structures are designed to span between supports and rely on fixed joints with moment resisting capacity where vertical supports connect to horizontal beams or trusses . Portal frame structures can be constructed using a variety of materials and methods . These include steel , reinforced concrete and laminated timber such as glulam . The connections between the columns and the rafters are designed to be moment-resistant , i.e . they can carry bending forces . They were first developed in the 1960s , and have now become the most common form of enclosure for spans of 20 to 60 m Because of these very strong and rigid joints , some of the bending moment in the rafters is transferred to the columns . This means that the size of the rafters can be reduced or the span can be increased for the same size rafters . This makes portal frames a very efficient construction technique to use for wide span buildings . Portal frame construction is therefore typically seen in warehouses , barns and other places where large , open spaces are required at low cost and a pitched roof is acceptable . Generally portal frames are used for single-story buildings but they can be used for low-rise buildings with several floors where they can be economic if the floors do not span right across the building ( in these circumstances a skeleton frame , with internal columns , would be a more economic choice ) . A typical configuration might be where there is office space built against one wall of a warehouse . Portal frames can be clad with all sorts of material but the most popular solution , for reasons of economy and speed , is some form of lightweight insulated metal cladding with cavity masonry work to the bottom 2m of the wall to provide security and impact resistance .",

  "/wiki/Muslim": "Muslims or Islamic people are people who follow or practice Islam , a monotheistic Abrahamic religion . Muslims consider the Quran , their holy book , to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad .

The beliefs of Muslims include : that God ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 All\u0101h ) is eternal , transcendent and absolutely one ( tawhid ) ; that God is incomparable , self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten ; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Moses , and Jesus ; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time ( tahrif ) and that the Quran is the final unaltered revelation from God ( Final Testament ) . ( Rao Muhammad Yousaf ) As of 2019 , 1.9 billion or about 24.4% of the world population are Muslims .
