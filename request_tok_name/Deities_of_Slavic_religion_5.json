  "/wiki/Rus'_(name)": "Originally , the name Rus ' ( ) referred to the people , regions , and medieval states ( 9th to 12th centuries ) of the Kievan Rus ' . In Western culture , it was better known as Ruthenia from the 11th century onwards , Its territories are today distributed among Belarus , Northern Ukraine , Eastern Poland , and the European section of Russia . The term \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f ( Rossija ) , comes from the Byzantine Greek designation of the Rus ' , \u03a1\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 Ross\u00eda - spelled \u03a1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ( Ros\u00eda ] ) in Modern Greek . One of the earliest written sources mentioning the people called Rus ' ( as Rhos ) dates to 839 in the Annales Bertiniani . This chronicle identifies them as a Germanic tribe called the Swedes . According to the Kievan Rus ' Primary Chronicle , compiled in about 1113 , the Rus ' were a group of Varangians , Norsemen who had relocated somewhere from the Baltic region ( literally from beyond the sea ) , first to Northeastern Europe , then to the south where they created the medieval Kievan state . In the 11th century , the dominant term in the Latin tradition was Ruscia . It was used , among others , by Thietmar of Merseburg , Adam of Bremen , Cosmas of Prague and Pope Gregory VII in his letter to Izyaslav I. Rucia , Ruzzia , Ruzsia were alternative spellings . During the 12th century , Ruscia gradually made way for two other Latin terms , Russia and Ruthenia . Russia ( also spelled Rossia and Russie ) was the dominant Romance-language form , first used by Liutprand of Cremona in the 960s and then by Peter Damian in the 1030s . It became ubiquitous in English and French documents in the 12th century . Ruthenia , first documented in the early 12th century Augsburg annals , was a Latin form preferred by the Apostolic Chancery of the Latin Church .",

  "/wiki/Ursa_Major": "Ursa Major ( ; also known as the Great Bear ) is a constellation in the northern sky , whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory . Its Latin name means greater ( or larger ) she-bear , referring to and contrasting it with nearby Ursa Minor , the lesser bear . In antiquity , it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD . Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations . Ursa Major is primarily known from the asterism of its main seven stars , which has been called the Big Dipper , the Wagon , Charles 's Wain , or the Plough , among other names . In particular , the Big Dipper 's stellar configuration mimics the shape of the Little Dipper . Two of its stars , named Dubhe and Merak ( \u03b1 Ursae Majoris and \u03b2 Ursae Majoris ) , can be used as the navigational pointer towards the place of the current northern pole star , Polaris in Ursa Minor . Ursa Major , along with asterisms that incorporate or comprise it , is significant to numerous world cultures , often as a symbol of the north . Its depiction on the flag of Alaska is a modern example of such symbolism . Ursa Major is visible throughout the year from most of the northern hemisphere , and appears circumpolar above the mid-northern latitudes . From southern temperate latitudes , the main asterism is invisible , but the southern parts of the constellation can still be viewed .",
  "/wiki/Vesta_(mythology)": "Vesta ( ) is the virgin goddess of the hearth , home , and family in Roman religion . She was rarely depicted in human form , and was often represented by the fire of her temple in the Forum Romanum . Entry to her temple was permitted only to her priestesses , the Vestals , who tended the sacred fire at the hearth in her temple . As she was considered a guardian of the Roman people , her festival , the Vestalia ( 7-15 June ) , was regarded as one of the most important Roman holidays . During the Vestalia matrons walked barefoot through the city to the sanctuary of the goddess , where they presented offerings of food . Such was Vesta 's importance to Roman religion that hers was one of the last republican pagan cults still active following the rise of Christianity until it was forcibly disbanded by the Christian emperor Theodosius I in AD 391 . The myths depicting Vesta and her priestesses were few , and were limited to tales of miraculous impregnation by a phallus appearing in the flames of the hearth - the manifestation of the goddess . Vesta was among the Dii Consentes , twelve of the most honored gods in the Roman pantheon . She was the daughter of Saturn and Ops , and sister of Jupiter , Neptune , Pluto , Juno , and Ceres . Her Greek equivalent is Hestia .",

People would feed Gabija by offering bread and salt . Fire had to be laid to bed - women would cover charcoal with ashes every evening so that fire would not wander around . Just as Gabija was the protector of the house , mother of the household was the protector of fire . Sometimes a bowl of clean water would be left near the hearth so that Gabija could wash herself . If angered , Gabija would go for a walk burning the house .",

From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central , Eastern and Southeastern Europe . Today , there is a large Slavic diaspora throughout North America , particularly in the United States and Canada as a result of immigration . Slavs are the largest ethno-linguistic group in Europe , followed by Germanic peoples and Romance peoples .

  "/wiki/Echo": "In audio signal processing and acoustics , echo is a reflection of sound that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound . The delay is directly proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener . Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well , by a building , or by the walls of an enclosed room and an empty room . A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source . The word echo derives from the Greek \u1f20\u03c7\u03ce ( \u0113ch\u014d ) , itself from \u1f26\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ( \u0113chos ) , sound .

However Fletcher sees this as a myth . He further writes that in Obdoria , near the mouth of Ob River there is a rock of shape resembling a ragged woman bearing a child in her hands , and Obdorian Samoyeds use it in their pagan sorcery .

The place of origin of her following is uncertain , but it is thought that she had popular followings in Thrace . Hecate was one of the main deities worshipped in Athenian households as a protective goddess and one who bestowed prosperity and daily blessings on the family . In the post-Christian writings of the Chaldean Oracles ( 2nd-3rd century CE ) she was regarded with ( some ) rulership over earth , sea , and sky , as well as a more universal role as Saviour ( Soteira ) , Mother of Angels and the Cosmic World Soul .

  "/wiki/Agriculture": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber ) .",

Along with her male companion Vesnik , she was associated with rituals conducted in rural areas during springtime . In the nineteenth century , Russian peasants celebrated the return of spring on March 1 by going out to the fields , carrying a clay figure of a lark on a pivot which had been decorated with flowers . They sang songs naming the spring season Vesna . The word vesna is still the poetic word for spring in the Slovene language , as well as Czech and Slovak . In Russian , Polish , Ukrainian and Belarusian languages vesna/wiosna is the actual word for spring . The month February is sometimes named vesnar in Slovene language . In Serbian , the word vesnik is used to denote someone who heralds or brings about springtime . In Slovene mythology , beautiful women called vesnas lived in palaces atop mountains where they discussed the fate of crops and of human inhabitants . A magical circle around their palaces kept them from leaving the mountain top except during February , when they would travel in wooden carts down to the valley below . Only certain people were capable of hearing them singing . People who snuck up to their mountain palaces might learn their fates , but risked an unpleasant end if they were caught by the vesnas ."
