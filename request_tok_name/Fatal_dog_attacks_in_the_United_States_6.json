  "/wiki/Pit_bull": "Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers . The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous , as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds , informal types and appearances that can not be reliably identified . Formal breeds often considered to be of the pit bull-type include the American Pit Bull Terrier , American Staffordshire Terrier , American Bully , and Staffordshire Bull Terrier . The American Bulldog is also sometimes included . Mixed-breed dogs which physically resemble these breeds often get labelled as pit bulls by shelters . Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from crossbreeding bull-baiting dogs ( used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls ) and terriers . After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned , such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs , to hunt and drive livestock , and as family companions . Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States , it still exists as an underground activity , and pit bulls are a common type used . According to the American Veterinary Medical Association , owners of pit bull-type dogs deal with a strong breed stigma ; however , controlled studies have not identified this breed group as disproportionately dangerous . Because owners of stigmatized breeds are more likely to have involvement in criminal or violent acts , breed correlations may have the owner 's behavior as the underlying causal factor . Some jurisdictions have enacted legislation banning the group of breeds , and some insurance companies do not cover liability from pit bull bites . Among other roles , pit bulls have served as police dogs , search and rescue dogs , and several have appeared on film .",

  "/wiki/Mongrel": "A mongrel , mixed-breed dog , or mutt or is a dog that does not belong to one officially recognized breed and is not the result of intentional breeding . Estimates place their numbers at 150 million animals worldwide . Although the term mixed-breed dog is preferred by some , many mongrels have no known purebred ancestors . Technically , crossbreed dogs , and designer dogs while also a mix of breeds , differ from mongrels in being intentionally bred . Although mongrels are viewed as of less commercial value than intentionally bred dogs , they are thought to be less susceptible to genetic health problems associated with inbreeding ( based on the theory of heterosis ) , and have enthusiasts and defenders who prefer them to intentionally bred dogs . Although mongrels exhibit great variation , generations of uncontrolled breeding and environmental pressures may tend to shape them toward certain general average body types and characteristics known as landraces , some of which may be developed by people into new standardized breeds . [ citation needed ] At other times , the word mongrel has been applied to informally purpose-bred dogs such as curs which were created at least in part from mongrels , especially if the breed is not officially recognized .",

  "/wiki/Shar_Pei": "The Shar-Pei is a breed of dog known for its deep wrinkles and blue-black tongue . The breed originates from southern China .

As puppies , Shar-Pei have numerous wrinkles , but as they mature , these loosen and spread out as they grow into their skin . The Shar-Pei was named in 1978 as one of the world 's rarest dog breeds by TIME magazine and Guinness World Records .

  "/wiki/Pitbulls": "Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers . The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous , as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds , informal types and appearances that can not be reliably identified . Formal breeds often considered to be of the pit bull-type include the American Pit Bull Terrier , American Staffordshire Terrier , American Bully , and Staffordshire Bull Terrier . The American Bulldog is also sometimes included . Mixed-breed dogs which physically resemble these breeds often get labelled as pit bulls by shelters . Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from crossbreeding bull-baiting dogs ( used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls ) and terriers . After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned , such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs , to hunt and drive livestock , and as family companions . Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States , it still exists as an underground activity , and pit bulls are a common type used . According to the American Veterinary Medical Association , owners of pit bull-type dogs deal with a strong breed stigma ; however , controlled studies have not identified this breed group as disproportionately dangerous . Because owners of stigmatized breeds are more likely to have involvement in criminal or violent acts , breed correlations may have the owner 's behavior as the underlying causal factor . Some jurisdictions have enacted legislation banning the group of breeds , and some insurance companies do not cover liability from pit bull bites . Among other roles , pit bulls have served as police dogs , search and rescue dogs , and several have appeared on film .",
