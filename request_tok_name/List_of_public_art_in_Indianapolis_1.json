  "/wiki/John_Spaulding_(artist)": "John A. Spaulding ( October 18 , 1942 - July 10 , 2004 ) was an American artist and sculptor from Indianapolis , Indiana . He was born in Lockefield Gardens , an Indianapolis public housing project on Indiana Avenue , which was known for its jazz clubs . Two of Spaulding 's sculptures , Jammin ' on the Avenue and Untitled ( Jazz Musicians ) , are located near his birthplace and celebrate the area 's musical heritage . Spaulding was the fifth of seven children . He attended Indianapolis Public Schools 24 and 26 and Arsenal Technical High School . He was a self-taught welder . Spaulding worked part-time on his art , while working as a metal-joining specialist in the aerospace industry in California in the 1960s . He relocated to New York City in 1978 and continued to work on his art . Spaulding 's work is internationally recognized , with pieces on display in several countries including Brazil , Japan , France , and England . He had studios for creating his works in California , New York , Rio de Janeiro , and Indianapolis . His sculptures have been inspired by nature and his African American heritage . He also created several large abstracts .",
  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",

  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",
  "/wiki/Aluminum": "Aluminium ( aluminum in American and Canadian English ) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13 . It is a silvery-white , soft , non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group . By mass , aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth 's crust , where it is the third most abundant element ( after oxygen and silicon ) and also the most abundant metal . Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth 's mantle below , however . The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium metal is highly reactive , such that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments . Instead , it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation . Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries , such as building facades and window frames . The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium . Despite its prevalence in the environment , no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals . Because of these salts ' abundance , the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest , and studies continue .",
  "/wiki/Siding": "Siding or wall cladding is the protective material attached to the exterior side of a wall of a house or other building . Along with the roof , it forms the first line of defense against the elements , most importantly sun , rain/snow , heat and cold , thus creating a stable , more comfortable environment on the interior side . The siding material and style also can enhance or detract from the building 's beauty . There is a wide and expanding variety of materials to side with , both natural and artificial , each with its own benefits and drawbacks . Masonry walls as such do not require siding , but any wall can be sided . Walls that are internally framed , whether with wood , or steel I-beams , however , must always be sided . Most siding consists of pieces of weather-resistant material that are smaller than the wall they cover , to allow for expansion and contraction of the materials due to moisture and temperature changes . There are various styles of joining the pieces , from board and batton , where the butt joints between panels is covered with a thin strip ( usually 1 to 2 inches wide ) of wood , to a variety of clapboard , also called lap siding , in which planks are laid horizontally across the wall starting from the bottom , and building up , the board below overlapped by the board above it . These techniques of joinery are designed to prevent water from entering the walls . Siding that does not consist of pieces joined together would include stucco , which is widely used in the Southwest . It is a plaster-like siding and is applied over a lattice , just like plaster . However , because of the lack of joints , it eventually cracks and is susceptible to water damage .",
  "/wiki/Roof_shingle": "Roof shingles are a roof covering consisting of individual overlapping elements . These elements are typically flat , rectangular shapes laid in courses from the bottom edge of the roof up , with each successive course overlapping the joints below . Shingles are made of various materials such as wood , slate , flagstone , metal , plastic , and composite materials such as fibre cement and asphalt shingles . Ceramic roof tiles , which still dominate in Europe and some parts of Asia , are still usually called tiles . Roof shingles may deteriorate faster and need to repel more water than wall shingles . They are a very common roofing material in the United States .",

  "/wiki/Stainless_steel": "In metallurgy , stainless steel , also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable ( inoxidizable ) , is a steel alloy , with a minimum of 11% chromium content by mass and a maximum of 1.2% carbon by mass . Stainless steels are most notable for their corrosion resistance , which increases with increasing chromium content . Additions of molybdenum increases corrosion resistance in reducing acids and against pitting attack in chloride solutions . Thus , there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure . Resistance to corrosion and staining , low maintenance , and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required . Stainless steel is rolled into sheets , plates , bars , wire , and tubing to be used in : cookware , cutlery , surgical instruments , major appliances ; construction material in large buildings , such as the Chrysler Building ; industrial equipment ( for example , in paper mills , chemical plants , water treatment ) ; and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products ( for example , chemical tankers and road tankers ) . Corrosion resistance , the ease with which it can be steam cleaned and sterilized , and lack of need for surface coatings has also influenced the use of stainless steel in commercial kitchens and food processing plants .",

  "/wiki/Aircraft_aluminum": "Aluminium alloys ( or aluminum alloys ; see spelling differences ) are alloys in which aluminium ( Al ) is the predominant metal . The typical alloying elements are copper , magnesium , manganese , silicon , tin and zinc . There are two principal classifications , namely casting alloys and wrought alloys , both of which are further subdivided into the categories heat-treatable and non-heat-treatable . About 85% of aluminium is used for wrought products , for example rolled plate , foils and extrusions . Cast aluminium alloys yield cost-effective products due to the low melting point , although they generally have lower tensile strengths than wrought alloys . The most important cast aluminium alloy system is Al-Si , where the high levels of silicon ( 4.0-13% ) contribute to give good casting characteristics . Aluminium alloys are widely used in engineering structures and components where light weight or corrosion resistance is required . Alloys composed mostly of aluminium have been very important in aerospace manufacturing since the introduction of metal-skinned aircraft . Aluminium-magnesium alloys are both lighter than other aluminium alloys and much less flammable than alloys that contain a very high percentage of magnesium . Aluminium alloy surfaces will develop a white , protective layer of aluminium oxide if left unprotected by anodizing and/or correct painting procedures . In a wet environment , galvanic corrosion can occur when an aluminium alloy is placed in electrical contact with other metals with more positive corrosion potentials than aluminium , and an electrolyte is present that allows ion exchange . Referred to as dissimilar-metal corrosion , this process can occur as exfoliation or as intergranular corrosion .",

  "/wiki/Concrete": "Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that hardens ( cures ) over time . In the past limebased cement binders were often used , such as lime putty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cements , such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to Portland stone ) . Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with different methods of binding aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder . When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape . The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses . Often , additives ( such as pozzolans or superplasticizers ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials ( such as rebar ) embedded to provide tensile strength , yielding reinforced concrete . Because concrete cures ( which is not the same as drying such as with paint ) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before . Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials . Its usage worldwide , ton for ton , is twice that of steel , wood , plastics , and aluminum combined . Globally , the ready-mix concrete industry , the largest segment of the concrete market , is projected to exceed $ 600 billion in revenue by 2025 . Concrete is distinct from mortar .",
  "/wiki/Metal": "A metal ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd m\u00e9tallon , mine , quarry , metal ) is a material that , when freshly prepared , polished , or fractured , shows a lustrous appearance , and conducts electricity and heat relatively well . Metals are typically malleable ( they can be hammered into thin sheets ) or ductile ( can be drawn into wires ) . A metal may be a chemical element such as iron ; an alloy such as stainless steel ; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride . In physics , a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero . Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures . For example , the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure . Equally , some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals . Sodium , for example , becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure . In chemistry , two elements that would otherwise qualify ( in physics ) as brittle metals - arsenic and antimony - are commonly instead recognised as metalloids , on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry . Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ( or are likely to be such ) . The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals , nonmetals , and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved . In astrophysics the term metal is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two , hydrogen and helium , and not just traditional metals .",
