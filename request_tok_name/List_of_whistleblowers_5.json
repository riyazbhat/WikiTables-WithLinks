As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .

  "/wiki/Military_intelligence": "Military intelligence is a military discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to assist commanders in their decisions . This aim is achieved by providing an assessment of data from a range of sources , directed towards the commanders ' mission requirements or responding to questions as part of operational or campaign planning . To provide an analysis , the commander 's information requirements are first identified , which are then incorporated into intelligence collection , analysis , and dissemination . Areas of study may include the operational environment , hostile , friendly and neutral forces , the civilian population in an area of combat operations , and other broader areas of interest . Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels , from tactical to strategic , in peacetime , the period of transition to war , and during a war itself . Most governments maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services . The military and civilian intelligence capabilities collaborate to inform the spectrum of political and military activities .

On April 5 , 2010 , the attacks received worldwide coverage and controversy following the release of 39 minutes of gunsight footage by the Internet whistleblower website WikiLeaks . The footage was portrayed as classified , but its confessed leaker , U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning , testified in 2013 that the video was not classified . The video , which WikiLeaks titled Collateral Murder , showed that the crew fired on a group of men and laughed at some of the casualties , some of whom were civilians and reporters . An anonymous U.S. military official confirmed the authenticity of the footage , which provoked global discussion on the legality and morality of the attacks . In the first strike , the crews of two Apaches directed 30 mm cannon fire at a group of ten Iraqi men , including some armed men , standing where insurgents earlier that day had shot at an American Humvee with small arms fire . Among the group were two Iraqi war correspondents working for Reuters , Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen . Seven men ( including Noor-Eldeen ) were killed during this first strike ; Saeed Chmagh , who was injured , later died in a hospital . The second strike , also using 30 mm rounds , was directed at a van whose driver , Saleh Matasher Tomal , appeared to happen to drive by and who proceeded to help the wounded Chmagh . However , in the long version of the video this van was targeted prior to the first engagement by one Apache ( Crazyhorse 1/8 ) as it traveled south toward the Reuters employees who were , simultaneously , targeted by the other Apache ( Crazyhorse 1/9 ) as they walked north on the same road toward the van . Minutes after the first engagement ended the van returned traveling in an opposite direction ( north ) once again on this same road . Two men assisting in the rescue effort were from a group of five standing at an intersection - seen in the upper right corner of the video when the Reuters employees arrive in the courtyard - reported to Apaches as being a second position combatants were using to attack the Humvee .",

The scandal rocked Japanese corporate governance , led to the resignation of the entire Olympus board and several arrests of senior executives , including the previous CEO and chairman , and the company 's former auditor and bankers among others , and made Woodford one of the most highly placed executives to turn whistleblower . By 2012 the scandal he exposed had developed into one of the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan .

  "/wiki/1Malaysia_Development_Berhad_scandal": "The 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal or 1MDB scandal is an ongoing political scandal occurring in Malaysia . In 2015 , Malaysia 's then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of channelling over RM 2.67 billion ( \u2248 US $ 700 million ) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad ( 1MDB ) , a government-run strategic development company , to his personal bank accounts . The event triggered widespread criticism among Malaysians , with many calling for Najib Razak 's resignation - including Dr. Mahathir Mohamad , one of Najib 's predecessors as Prime Minister , who eventually defeated Najib to return to power after the 2018 general election . Political leader Anwar Ibrahim has openly questioned the credentials of 1MDB . He told Parliament that according to the records held by the companies commission , the company has no business address and no appointed auditor . According to its publicly filed accounts , 1MDB has nearly RM 42 billion ( US $ 11.73 billion ) in debt . Some of this debt resulted from a $ 3 billion state-guaranteed 2013 bond issue led by Goldman Sachs , who is believed to have made as much as $ 300 million in fees from that deal alone , although it disputes this figure . Conference of Rulers in Malaysia has called for the investigations by the government to be completed as soon as possible , saying that the issue is causing a crisis of confidence in Malaysia . After the 2018 election , the newly elected Prime Minister , Mahathir Mohamad , said there was enough evidence to reopen a probe into the 1MDB scandal . In the months after the election , Malaysian authorities barred Najib Razak from leaving the country , seized a huge haul of cash and valuable items from premises linked to him , and charged him with criminal breach of trust , money laundering and abuse of power , while Jho Low was charged with money laundering . Having filed complaints alleging that more than US $ 4.5 billion was diverted from 1MDB by Jho Low and other conspirators including officials from Malaysia , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , the U.S. Department of Justice said it would continue to pursue investigations into 1MDB and looked forward to working with Malaysian authorities . The whistle-blower was the Swiss banker and former director of PetroSaudi Xavier Justo .",

His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs , many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments , and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy . In 2013 , Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor , Booz Allen Hamilton , after previous employment with Dell and the CIA . Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored . On May 20 , 2013 , Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii , and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald , Laura Poitras , and Ewen MacAskill . Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post . Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times . On June 21 , 2013 , the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property , following which the Department of State revoked his passport . Two days later , he flew into Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport , where Russian authorities noted that his U.S. passport had been cancelled , and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month .

A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation .

Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies .

Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates .

  "/wiki/Whistleblower": "A whistleblower ( also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower ) is a person who exposes secretive information or activity that is deemed illegal , unethical , or not correct within a private or public organization .

Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally . Internally , a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor . Externally , a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media , government , law enforcement , or those who are concerned . Whistleblowers , however , take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing . Because of this , a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers . Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers , but that protection can only go so far . Whistleblowers face legal action , criminal charges , social stigma , and termination from any position , office , or job . Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public .

  "/wiki/Tax_avoidance": "Tax avoidance is the legal usage of the tax regime in a single territory to one 's own advantage to reduce the amount of tax that is payable by means that are within the law . Tax sheltering is very similar , although unlike tax avoidance tax sheltering is not necessarily legal . Tax havens are jurisdictions which facilitate reduced taxes . While forms of tax avoidance which use tax laws in ways not intended by governments may be considered legal , it is almost never considered moral in the court of public opinion and rarely in journalism . Many corporations and businesses which take part in the practice experience a backlash , either from their active customers or online . Conversely , benefiting from tax laws in ways which were intended by governments is sometimes referred to as tax planning . The World Bank 's World Development Report 2019 on the future of work supports increased government efforts to curb tax avoidance as part of a new social contract focused on human capital investments and expanded social protection . Tax mitigation , tax aggressive , aggressive tax avoidance or tax neutral schemes generally refer to multi-territory schemes that fall into the grey area between commonplace and well-accepted tax avoidance ( such as purchasing municipal bonds in the United States ) and evasion , but are widely viewed as unethical , especially if they are involved in profit-shifting from high-tax to low-tax territories and territories recognised as tax havens . Since 1995 , trillions of dollars have been transferred from OECD and developing countries into tax havens using these schemes . Laws known as a General Anti-Avoidance Rule ( GAAR ) statutes which prohibit tax aggressive avoidance have been passed in several countries and regions including Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Norway , Hong Kong and the United Kingdom . In addition , judicial doctrines have accomplished the similar purpose , notably in the United States through the business purpose and economic substance doctrines established in Gregory v. Helvering and in the UK through the Ramsay case . Though the specifics may vary according to jurisdiction , these rules invalidate tax avoidance which is technically legal but not for a business purpose or in violation of the spirit of the tax code .",

The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems . The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission , the majority of which are clandestine . Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II , it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 . Since then , it has become the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget . The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end . The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet , which severely damaged Iran 's nuclear program . The NSA , alongside the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe ; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service ( a highly classified intelligence team ) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets ( such as Presidential palaces or embassies ) . SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass close surveillance , burglary , wiretapping , [ and ] breaking and entering .

  "/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013\u2013present)": "Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the United States National Security Agency ( NSA ) and its international partners ' global surveillance of both foreign nationals and U.S. citizens . The reports mostly emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden , which he obtained whilst working for Booz Allen Hamilton , one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States . In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents , Snowden 's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian , British and Canadian intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive Five Eyes network . In June 2013 , the first of Snowden 's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian , attracting considerable public attention . The disclosure continued throughout 2013 , and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide , most notably The New York Times ( United States ) , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Der Spiegel ( Germany ) , O Globo ( Brazil ) , Le Monde ( France ) , L'espresso ( Italy ) , NRC Handelsblad ( the Netherlands ) , Dagbladet ( Norway ) , El Pa\u00eds ( Spain ) , and Sveriges Television ( Sweden ) . These media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance . For example , Der Spiegel revealed how the German Foreign Intelligence Service ( German : Bundesnachrichtendienst ; BND ) transfers massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA , while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment ( FRA ) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection , under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance . Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia ( ASD ) , Britain ( GCHQ ) , Canada ( CSEC ) , Denmark ( PET ) , France ( DGSE ) , Germany ( BND ) , Italy ( AISE ) , the Netherlands ( AIVD ) , Norway ( NIS ) , Spain ( CNI ) , Switzerland ( NDB ) , Singapore ( SID ) as well as Israel ( ISNU ) , which receives raw , unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA .

  "/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)": "PRISM is a code name for a program under which the United States National Security Agency ( NSA ) collects internet communications from various U.S. internet companies . The program is also known by the SIGAD US-984XN . PRISM collects stored internet communications based on demands made to internet companies such as Google LLC under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to turn over any data that match court-approved search terms . The NSA can use these PRISM requests to target communications that were encrypted when they traveled across the internet backbone , to focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded earlier , and to get data that is easier to handle , among other things . PRISM began in 2007 in the wake of the passage of the Protect America Act under the Bush Administration . The program is operated under the supervision of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISA Court , or FISC ) pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) . Its existence was leaked six years later by NSA contractor Edward Snowden , who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as dangerous and criminal activities . The disclosures were published by The Guardian and The Washington Post on June 6 , 2013 . Subsequent documents have demonstrated a financial arrangement between the NSA 's Special Source Operations division ( SSO ) and PRISM partners in the millions of dollars . Documents indicate that PRISM is the number one source of raw intelligence used for NSA analytic reports , and it accounts for 91% of the NSA 's internet traffic acquired under FISA section 702 authority . The leaked information came after the revelation that the FISA Court had been ordering a subsidiary of telecommunications company Verizon Communications to turn over to the NSA logs tracking all of its customers ' telephone calls . U.S. government officials have disputed criticisms of PRISM in the Guardian and Washington Post articles and have defended the program , asserting that it can not be used on domestic targets without a warrant , that it has helped to prevent acts of terrorism , and that it receives independent oversight from the federal government 's executive , judicial and legislative branches .",
