It consists of a concrete buttress dam 1 km wide with a maximum height of 68m , and an earth dam on either side . The earth dam on the eastern bank is 4 km long , and that on the western bank is 8.5 km long . The reservoir is about 290 km2 .",
  "/wiki/Reservoir": "A reservoir ( from French r\u00e9servoir - a tank ) is , most commonly , an enlarged natural or artificial lake , pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water . Reservoirs can be created in a number of ways , including controlling a watercourse that drains an existing body of water , interrupting a watercourse to form an embayment within it , through excavation , or building any number of retaining walls or levees . Defined as a storage space for fluids , reservoirs may hold water or gasses , including hydrocarbons . Tank reservoirs store these in ground-level , elevated , or buried tanks . Tank reservoirs for water are also called cisterns . Most underground reservoirs are used to store liquids , principally either water or petroleum , below ground .",

With the White Nile , it is one of the two major tributaries of the Nile . The Blue Nile supplies about 80% of the water in the Nile during the rainy season .",
  "/wiki/Merowe_Dam": "The Merowe Dam , also known as Merowe High Dam , Merowe Multi-Purpose Hydro Project or Hamdab Dam , is a large dam near Merowe Town in northern Sudan , about 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) north of the capital Khartoum . Its dimensions make it the largest contemporary hydropower project in Africa . It is situated on the river Nile , close to and inundating the 4th Cataract where the river divides into multiple smaller branches with large islands in between . Merowe is a city about 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) downstream from the construction site at Hamdab . The main purpose for building the dam was the generation of electricity .",
  "/wiki/Nile": "The Nile ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 , romanized : an-N\u012bl , Arabic pronunciation : [ an'ni\u02d0l ] ) is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa , and is the longest river in Africa and the disputed longest river in the world , as the Brazilian government says that the Amazon River is longer than the Nile . The Nile , which is about 6,650 km ( 4,130 mi ) [ n 1 ] long , is an international river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries : Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Kenya , Ethiopia , Eritrea , South Sudan , Republic of the Sudan , and Egypt . In particular , the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan . The Nile has two major tributaries - the White Nile and the Blue Nile . The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself . The Blue Nile , however , is the source of most of the water and silt . The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa , with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi . It flows north through Tanzania , Lake Victoria , Uganda and South Sudan . The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast . The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum . The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt , then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea . Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times .",

  "/wiki/Jebel_Aulia_Dam": "The Jebal Aulia Dam is a dam on the White Nile near Khartoum , Sudan . Its construction began 1933 and was completed in 1937 . When completed it was the largest dam in the World . The dam was built by Gibson and Pauling ( Foreign ) Ltd , which was a partnership between the British civil engineering company Pauling & Co. and the civil engineer John Watson Gibson . In 2003 a hydroelectricity project with a 30-megawatt ( 40,000 hp ) maximum capacity was completed on the dam . This increased the structure 's strategic value , so it is now continually guarded by the Sudanese Army . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Khashm_el-Girba_Dam": "The Khashm el-Girba Dam is a gravity and embankment composite dam on the Atbarah River about 4 km ( 2 mi ) south of Khashm El Girba in Eastern Sudan . The primary purpose of the dam is irrigation . The dam is equipped with canal headworks , located on its left bank , which divert water into a canal . When water levels in the reservoir are low , three pumps move water into the canal . The main portion of the dam is an earthen embankment ; the spillway and irrigation headworks sections are concrete gravity . The dam has a small hydroelectric power station , which was upgraded during the period 2002-04 to its current installed capacity of 10 megawatts ( 13,000 hp ) ."
