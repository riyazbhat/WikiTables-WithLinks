It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

It covered an area of 7,700 square kilometres ( 3,000 sq mi ) , almost entirely surrounded by what was then the Cape Province , and possessed a small coastline along the shore of the Indian Ocean . Under South Africa 's policy of apartheid , land was set aside for black peoples in self-governing territories . Ciskei was designated as one of two homelands or Bantustans for Xhosa-speaking people . Ngqika ( Rharhabe ) Xhosa people were forcibly resettled in the Ciskei , and Gcaleka Xhosa were settled in the Transkei , the other Xhosa homeland . Unlike the other Bantustans , including Transkei , which saw itself as a Xhosa homeland , Ciskei has been described as having absolutely no basis in any ethnic , cultural or linguistic fact whatsoever despite efforts by the Ciskei authorities to create a distinctive Ciskeian identity . In contrast to the Transkei , which was largely contiguous and deeply rural , and governed by hereditary chiefs , the area that became the Ciskei had been made up of a patchwork of reserves interspersed with pockets of white-owned farms . There were elected headmen , it had a relatively educated working class populace and there was a tendency of the region 's black residents , who often worked in East London , Queenstown and King Williams Town , to oppose traditional methods of control . These differences have been posited as the reason for two separate homelands for the Xhosa people being developed , as well as the later nominal independence of Ciskei from South Africa , than Transkei . After its creation , large numbers of blacks were expelled from designed white areas in the Cape Province by the Apartheid government to Ciskei , in particular , non-productive Bantus-women with dependent children , the elderly , and the infirm , and it was also treated as a reservoir of cheap black labour .

After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 .
