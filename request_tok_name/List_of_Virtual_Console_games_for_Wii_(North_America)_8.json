  "/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) is an American self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games . The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association ( ESA , formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association ( IDSA ) ) , in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content , particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings following the releases of Mortal Kombat and Night Trap for home consoles . The industry , pressured with potential government oversight of video game ratings from these hearings , established both the IDSA and the ESRB within it to create a voluntary ratings system based on the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system with additional considerations for video game interactivity . The board assigns ratings to games based on their content , using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries , using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game 's content and suitability , along with a system of content descriptors which detail specific types of content present in a particular game . More recently , the ratings also include descriptors for games with online interactivity or in-game monetization . The ratings are determined by a combination of material provided by the game 's publisher in both questionnaires and video footage of the game , and a review of this material by a panel of reviewers who assign it a rating . The ratings are designed towards parents so they can make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children . Once a game is rated , the ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games - ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences . The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries for physical releases ; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB 's highest age ratings , and do not stock games which have not been rated . Additionally , major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings , while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only . More recently , the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps , which utilizes a survey answered by the product 's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff , allowing online storefronts to filter and restrict titles based on the ESRB . Through the International Age Rating Coalition ( IARC ) , this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories .",

  "/wiki/Namco": "Namco Ltd. [ a ] ( stylized as NAMCO ) [ b ] is a former Japanese developer and publisher of arcade and home console video games , originally headquartered in \u014cta , Tokyo . Several international divisions were established , including Namco America in Santa Clara , California , Shanghai Namco in mainland China , and Namco Enterprises Asia in Hong Kong . Namco was founded by Masaya Nakamura as Nakamura Seisakusho [ c ] on June 1 , 1955 , beginning as a producer of coin-operated amusement rides for Japanese department store roof gardens , seeing success with making children 's rides for the Mitsukoshi chain . Renamed Nakamura Manufacturing in 1959 , the company purchased the struggling Japanese division of Atari from Nolan Bushnell in 1974 and began releasing their games in Japan , where they quickly became one of the leading game companies in Asia . The acquisition inspired Namco to produce their own video games in-house , beginning with Gee Bee in 1978 . Namco released their first major hit Galaxian a year later , followed by Pac-Man in 1980 - the latter has since become the most successful arcade game of all time and one of the highest-grossing video games of all time . In February 2005 , Namco announced they would merge with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings . The merge was finalized on September 25 , creating Japan 's third-largest video game entity by revenue and the seventh largest by revenue in the world . Both operated independently under the new holdings company until March 31 , 2006 , where their video game operations were merged to form Namco Bandai Games . The original Namco name was spun-off into a new company the same day , which handled the amusement park and arcade center operations of Bandai Namco Holdings . It was renamed to Bandai Namco Amusement during a corporate restructuring on April 1 , 2018 . Namco produced several critically and commercially successful franchises , including Pac-Man , Galaxian , Tekken , Ace Combat , Dig Dug , Soulcalibur , Xevious , Ridge Racer and Tales , and was one of the world 's most prolific video game companies .",

  "/wiki/The_Tower_of_Druaga": "The Tower of Druaga [ a ] is a 1984 action role-playing maze arcade game developed and published in Japan by Namco . Controlling the golden-armored knight Gilgamesh , the player is tasked with scaling 60 floors of the titular tower in an effort to rescue the maiden Ki from Druaga , a demon with eight arms and four legs , who plans to use an artifact known as the Blue Crystal Rod to enslave all of mankind . It ran on the Namco Super Pac-Man arcade hardware , modified with a horizontal-scrolling video system used in Mappy . Druaga was designed by Masanobu Endo , best known for creating Xevious ( 1983 ) . Inspired by games such as Wizardry and Dungeons & Dragons , it was conceived as a fantasy Pac-Man with combat and puzzle solving , taking inspiration from Sumerian , Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology . It began as a prototype game called Quest with interlocking mazes , revised to run on an arcade system ; the original concept was scrapped due to Endo disliking the heavy use of role-playing elements , instead becoming a more action-oriented game . In Japan , The Tower of Druaga was widely successful , attracting millions of fans for its use of secrets and hidden items . It is cited as an important game of its genre for laying down the foundation for future games , as well as inspiring the idea of sharing tips with friends and guidebooks . Druaga is noted as being influential for many games to follow , including Ys , Hydlide , Dragon Slayer and The Legend of Zelda . In North America , the game was met with a more negative reception for its obtuse design , which many said was near-impossible to finish without a guidebook , alongside its high difficulty and controls . The success of the game in Japan inspired several ports for multiple platforms , as well as spawning a massive franchise known as the Babylonian Castle Saga , including multiple sequels , spin-offs , literature and an anime series produced by Gonzo .",

Originally conceived as a realistic military-themed game played in the third-person perspective and featuring a player-controlled fighter jet , technical and memory restrictions resulted in Sega developer Yu Suzuki redesigning it around a jet-propelled human character in a fantasy setting . With an analog flight stick and a cockpit-style cabinet that tilted and rolled during play , it was advertised by Sega as a taikan ( body sensation ) arcade game . Critically praised for its innovative graphics and gameplay , Space Harrier is often ranked among Suzuki 's best works . It has made several crossover appearances in other Sega titles , while PlatinumGames director Hideki Kamiya cited it as an inspiration for his entering the video game industry . Space Harrier has been ported to over twenty different home computer and gaming platforms , either by Sega or outside developers such as Dempa in Japan and Elite Systems in North America and Europe .
