  "/wiki/Agr\u00e9ment": "Agr\u00e9ment is a specialized term in the field of international affairs that refers to the agreement by a state to receive members of a diplomatic mission from a foreign country . In this procedure , diplomatic connections consent by the demande d ' agr\u00e9ation obtained prior to the appointment of a diplomat of the posting state . The posting state showcases an accreditation letter which is presented to the appointed diplomat by the head of state on the diplomat 's arrival . They are thereby accepted as a member of the diplomatic corps of the receiving state and added to a diplomatic list . The designated personage enjoys diplomatic immunity in the receiving state . The state receiving the designated diplomat may refuse the agr\u00e9ment without giving a reason , making the designated diplomat persona non grata . The absence of a timely agr\u00e9ment is often seen as a signal to designate a different individual .",

  "/wiki/Ambassador": "An ambassador is an official envoy , especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment . The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known , without national appointment , to represent certain professions , activities and fields of endeavor such as sales . An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital . The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy , whose territory , staff , and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country . Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank . Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a charg\u00e9 d'affaires in place of an ambassador . The equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the Commonwealth of Nations are known as High Commissioners . The ambassadors of the Holy See are known as Papal or Apostolic Nuncios .",
  "/wiki/Chinese_language": "Chinese ( simplified Chinese : \u6c49\u8bed ; traditional Chinese : \u6f22\u8a9e ; pinyin : H\u00e0ny\u01d4 ; literally : 'Han language ' ; or especially though not exclusively for written Chinese : \u4e2d\u6587 ; Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n ; 'Chinese writing ' ) is a group of languages that forms the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages . Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China . About 1.2 billion people ( around 16% of the world 's population ) speak some form of Chinese as their first language . The varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech , without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible . Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility , linguists generally describe them as distinct languages , perhaps hundreds , sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages . [ b ] Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started . Currently , most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups , based on often superficial phonetic developments , of which the most populous by far is Mandarin ( about 800 million speakers , e.g . Southwestern Mandarin ) , followed by Min ( 75 million , e.g . Southern Min ) , Wu ( 74 million , e.g . Shanghainese ) , Yue ( 68 million , e.g . Cantonese ) . These groups are unintelligible to each other , and generally many of their subgroups are mutually unintelligible as well ( e.g. , not only is Min Chinese a family of mutually unintelligible languages , but Southern Min itself is not a single language ) .",

Li trained to be an engineer in the USSR and worked at an important national power company after returning to China . He escaped the political turmoil of the 1950s , '60s and '70s due to his political connections and his employment in the company . After Deng Xiaoping became China 's leader in the late 1970s , Li took a number of increasingly important and powerful political positions , eventually becoming premier in 1987 . As Premier , Li was the most visible representative of China 's government who backed the use of force to quell the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . During the protests Li used his authority as premier to declare martial law and , in cooperation with Deng Xiaoping , who was the Chairman of the Central Military Commission , ordered the June 1989 military crackdown against student pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square . Li advocated a largely conservative approach to Chinese economic reform , which placed him at odds with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang , who fell out of favour in 1989 .",

A tough administrator , his time in office saw continued double-digit growth of the Chinese economy and China 's increased assertiveness in international affairs .
