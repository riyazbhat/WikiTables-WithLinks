The asylum is next to the village of Hanwell but parochially was in Southall ( officially in the 1830s the northern precinct ( chapelry ) of Norwood ) . It is about 8 miles or 13 km west of Central London and 6 miles ( 10 km ) south-east of Uxbridge . The building lies on a gently sloping river gravel terrace , a common feature of the Thames Valley .
