Krak\u00f3w was the official capital of Poland until 1596 and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic , economic , cultural and artistic life . Cited as one of Europe 's most beautiful cities , its Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland 's second most important city . It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading centre of Central Europe in 965 . With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century , Krak\u00f3w reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre . The city has a population of about 770,000 , with approximately 8 million additional people living within a 100 km ( 62 mi ) radius of its main square . After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany at the start of World War II , the newly defined Distrikt Krakau ( Krak\u00f3w District ) became the capital of Germany 's General Government . The Jewish population of the city was forced into a walled zone known as the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto , from which they were sent to German extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz never to return , and the Nazi concentration camps like P\u0142asz\u00f3w . However , the city was spared from destruction and major bombing .

It was the property of Kuyavian bishops and clergy until the end of the 18th century , when \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by Prussia as a result of the second partition of Poland . Following the collapse of the independent Duchy of Warsaw , the city became part of Congress Poland , a client state of the Russian Empire . It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced rapid growth in the cloth industry and in population due to the inflow of migrants , most notably Germans and Jews . Ever since the industrialization of the area , the city has struggled with many difficulties such as multinationalism and social inequality , which were vividly documented in the novel The Promised Land written by Polish Nobel Prize-winning author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont . The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city , where luxurious mansions coexisted with redbrick factories and dilapidated tenement houses .

Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the Vistula River and is about 170 km ( 106 mi ) to the southeast of Warsaw by road . One of the events that greatly contributed to the city 's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385 . Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Krak\u00f3w ; the inhabitants had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . Lublin witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century . A Calvinist congregation was founded and groups of radical Arians appeared in the city , making it an important global centre of Arianism . At the turn of the century , Lublin was recognized for hosting a number of outstanding poets , writers , and historians of the epoch . Until the partitions at the end of the 18th century , Lublin was a royal city of the Crown Kingdom of Poland . Its delegates and nobles had the right to participate in the royal election . In 1578 , Lublin was chosen as the seat of the Crown Tribunal , the highest appeal court in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , and for centuries , the city has been flourishing as a centre of culture and higher learning , with Krak\u00f3w , Warsaw , Pozna\u0144 , and Lw\u00f3w .",

The metropolis stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland and its population is officially estimated at 1.8 million residents . With a greater metropolitan area of 3.1 million residents , Warsaw is the 5th most-populous urban area in the European Union . The city limits cover 517.24 square kilometres ( 199.71 sq mi ) , while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres ( 2,355.39 sq mi ) . Warsaw is an alpha global city , a major international tourist destination , and a significant cultural , political and economic hub . Its historical old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Once described as the Paris of the North , Warsaw was believed to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world until World War II . Bombed at the start of the German invasion in 1939 , the city withstood a siege for which it was later awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for heroism , the Virtuti Militari . Deportations of the Jewish population to concentration camps led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the destruction of the Ghetto after a month of combat . A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive . Warsaw gained the new title of Phoenix City because of its extensive history and complete reconstruction after World War II , which had left over 85% of its buildings in ruins . Warsaw is one of Europe 's most dynamic metropolitan cities .",

With a population of approximately 128,137 ( December 2018 ) , it is the capital of Opole Voivodeship and the seat of Opole County . With its long history dating back to the 8th century , Opole is one of the oldest cities in Poland . It is also the smallest city in Poland to be the largest city in a voivodeship . The origins of the first settlement are connected with the town being granted Magdeburg Rights in 1217 by Casimir I of Opole , the great-grandson of Polish Duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth . During the Medieval Period and the Renaissance the city was known as a centre of commerce due to its position on the intersection of several main trade routes , which helped to generate steady profits from transit trade . The rapid development of the town was also caused by the establishment of a seat of regency in Opole in 1816 . The first railway connection between Oppeln , Brieg and Breslau was opened in 1843 and the first manufacturing plants were constructed in 1859 , which greatly contributed to the city 's regional significance . The city 's extensive heritage entails almost all cultures of Central Europe including years of Polish , Bohemian , Prussian and German rule . Opole formally became part of Poland again in 1945 under the Potsdam Agreement . Many German Upper Silesians and Poles of German ancestry still reside in the Opole region ; in the city itself , however , ethnic Germans today make up less than 3% of the population following the 1945-6 expulsions . Today there are four higher education establishments in the city : The Opole University , Opole University of Technology , a Medical College and the private Higher College of Management and Administration .",

For centuries , Gdynia remained a small farming and fishing village on the Baltic coast . At the beginning of the 20th-century Gdynia became a seaside resort town and experienced an inflow of tourists . This triggered an increase in local population . After Poland regained its independence in 1918 , a decision was made to construct a Polish seaport in Gdynia , between the Free City of Danzig ( a semi-autonomous city-state under joint League of Nations and Polish administration ) and German Pomerania , making Gdynia the primary economic hub of the Polish Corridor . It was then that the town was given a more cosmopolitan character with modernism being the dominant architectural style and emerged as a city in 1926 . The rapid development of Gdynia was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II . The German troops refrained from deliberate bombing . The newly built port and shipyard were completely destroyed during the war . The population of the city suffered much heavier losses as most of the inhabitants were evicted and expelled .",

With the population of 294,510 ( as of 2018 ) , it is the eleventh-largest city in Poland . The wider Katowice urban area has the population of approximately 2 to 3 million people . Throughout the mid-18th century , Katowice had developed into a village upon the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area . In 1742 the First Silesian War transferred Upper Silesia , including Katowice , to Prussia . Subsequently , from the second half of the 18th century , many German or Prussian craftsmen , merchants and artists began to settle in the region , which had been inhabited mostly by Poles over the past hundreds of years . Simultaneously Silesia experienced the influx of the first Jewish settlers . In the first half of the 19th century , intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks , mines , foundries and artisan workshops . This also contributed to the establishment of companies and eventual rapid growth of the city . At the same time , Katowice became linked to the railway system with the first train arriving at the main station in 1847 . The outbreak of World War I was favourable for Katowice due to the prospering steel industry . Following Germany 's defeat and the Silesian Uprisings , Katowice and parts of Upper Silesia were annexed by the Second Polish Republic .",

Located near the Baltic Sea and the German border , it is a major seaport and Poland 's seventh-largest city . As of December 2018 , the population was 402,465 . Szczecin is located on the Oder , south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania . The city is situated along the southwestern shore of D\u0105bie Lake , on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river . Szczecin is adjacent to the town of Police and is the urban centre of the Szczecin agglomeration , an extended metropolitan area that includes communities in the German states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern . The city 's recorded history began in the 8th century as a Slavic Pomeranian stronghold , built at the site of the Ducal castle . In the 12th century , when Szczecin had become one of Pomerania 's main urban centres , it lost its independence to Piast Poland , the Duchy of Saxony , the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark , and became completely German speaking by the 14th century . At the same time , the House of Griffins established themselves as local rulers and the population was Christianized . After the Treaty of Stettin in 1630 , the town came under the control of the Swedish Empire and became in 1648 the Capital of Swedish Pomerania until 1720 , when it was acquired by the Kingdom of Prussia and then the German Empire . Following World War II Stettin became part of Poland in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement , resulting in the almost complete expulsion of the pre-war population . Szczecin is the administrative and industrial centre of West Pomeranian Voivodeship and is the site of the University of Szczecin , Pomeranian Medical University , Maritime University , West Pomeranian University of Technology , Szczecin Art Academy , and the see of the Szczecin-Kamie\u0144 Catholic Archdiocese ."
