Impulsive aggression is not premeditated , and is defined by a disproportionate reaction to any provocation , real or perceived . Some individuals have reported affective changes prior to an outburst ( e.g. , tension , mood changes , energy changes , etc. ) . The disorder is currently categorized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) under the Disruptive , Impulse-Control , and Conduct Disorders category . The disorder itself is not easily characterized and often exhibits comorbidity with other mood disorders , particularly bipolar disorder . Individuals diagnosed with IED report their outbursts as being brief ( lasting less than an hour ) , with a variety of bodily symptoms ( sweating , stuttering , chest tightness , twitching , palpitations ) reported by a third of one sample . Aggressive acts are frequently reported accompanied by a sensation of relief and in some cases pleasure , but often followed by later remorse .",

  "/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_Personality_Disorder": "Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder ( OCPD ) is a personality disorder characterized by excessive concern with orderliness , perfectionism , attention to details , mental and interpersonal control , and a need for control over one 's environment , which interferes with flexibility , openness to experience , and efficiency , as well as interpersonal relationships . Workaholism and miserliness are also seen often in those with this personality disorder . Persons affected with this disorder may find it hard to relax , always feeling that time is running out for their activities , and that more effort is needed to achieve their goals . They may plan their activities down to the minutea manifestation of the compulsive tendency to keep control over their environment and to dislike unpredictable events as elements beyond their control . The cause of OCPD is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors . This is a distinctly different disorder from obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , and the relation between the two is contentious . Some ( but not all ) studies have found high comorbidity rates between the two disorders , and both may share outside similaritiesrigid and ritual-like behaviors , for example . Hoarding , orderliness , and a need for symmetry and organization are often seen in people with either disorder . Attitudes toward these behaviors differ between people affected with either of the disorders : for people with OCD , these behaviors are unwanted and seen as unhealthy , being the product of anxiety-inducing and involuntary thoughts , while for people with OCPD they are egosyntonic ( that is , they are perceived by the subject as rational and desirable ) , being the result of , for example , a strong adherence to routines , a natural inclination towards cautiousness , or a desire to achieve perfection . The disorder occurs more often in men .",

  "/wiki/Swaraj": "Swar\u0101j ( swa- self , raj rule ) can mean generally self-governance or self-rule , and was used synonymously with home-rule by Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati and later on by Mohandas Gandhi , but the word usually refers to Gandhi 's concept for Indian independence from foreign domination . Swaraj lays stress on governance , not by a hierarchical government , but by self governance through individuals and community building . The focus is on political decentralisation . Since this is against the political and social systems followed by Britain , Gandhi 's concept of Swaraj advocated India 's discarding British political , economic , bureaucratic , legal , military , and educational institutions . S. Satyamurti , Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru were among a contrasting group of Swarajists who laid the foundation for parliamentary democracy in India . Although Gandhi 's aim of totally implementing the concepts of Swaraj in India was not achieved , the voluntary work organisations which he founded for this purpose did serve as precursors and role models for people 's movements , voluntary organisations , and some of the non-governmental organisations that were subsequently launched in various parts of India . The student movement against oppressive local and central governments , led by Jayaprakash Narayan , and the Bhoodan movement , which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India , and which ultimately led to India 's discarding of the Zamindari system of land tenure and social organisation , were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj . However , Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , Indian Maratha ruler also fought for Swaraj in India as Deccan sultans and Mughal emperor were Firangi , Outsiders etc . His ideas of Swaraj are remembered by many Indians today as well .",
