  "/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights": "The European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR or ECtHR ; French : Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de lhomme ) , frequently referred to as the Strasbourg Court , is a supranational or international court established by the European Convention on Human Rights . The court hears applications alleging that a contracting state has breached one or more of the human rights provisions concerning civil and political rights set out in the convention and its protocols . An application can be lodged by an individual , a group of individuals , or one or more of the other contracting states . Aside from judgments , the court can also issue advisory opinions . The convention was adopted within the context of the Council of Europe , and all of its 47 member states are contracting parties to the convention . The court is based in Strasbourg , France .",
  "/wiki/Insurance_law": "Insurance law is the practice of law surrounding insurance , including insurance policies and claims . It can be broadly broken into three categories - regulation of the business of insurance ; regulation of the content of insurance policies , especially with regard to consumer policies ; and regulation of claim handling .",
  "/wiki/Tort_law": "A tort , in common law jurisdictions , is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm , resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act . It can include the intentional infliction of emotional distress , negligence , financial losses , injuries , invasion of privacy and many other things . Tort law , a suit where the purpose of a legal action is to obtain a private civil remedy such as damages , may be compared to criminal law , which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state . Tort law may also be contrasted with contract law , which also provides a civil remedy after breach of duty ; but whereas the contractual obligation is one chosen by the parties , the obligation in both tort and crime is imposed by the state . In both contract and tort , successful claimants must show that they have suffered foreseeable loss or harm as a direct result of the breach of duty .",
  "/wiki/Probate_law": "Probate is the judicial process whereby a will is proved in a court of law and accepted as a valid public document that is the true last testament of the deceased , or whereby the estate is settled according to the laws of intestacy in the state of residence [ or real property ] of the deceased at time of death in the absence of a legal will . The granting of probate is the first step in the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased person , resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person 's property under a will . A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator 's ( deceased person 's ) will and grants its approval , also known as granting probate , to the executor . The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary . A probate also officially appoints the executor ( or personal representative ) , generally named in the will , as having legal power to dispose of the testator 's assets in the manner specified in the testator 's will . However , through the probate process , a will may be contested .",
  "/wiki/Bankruptcy_law": "Bankruptcy is a legal process through which people or other entities who can not repay debts to creditors may seek relief from some or all of their debts . In most jurisdictions , bankruptcy is imposed by a court order , often initiated by the debtor . Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have , and the term bankruptcy is therefore not a synonym for insolvency .",
  "/wiki/Civil_procedure": "Civil procedure is the body of law that sets out the rules and standards that courts follow when adjudicating civil lawsuits ( as opposed to procedures in criminal law matters ) . These rules govern how a lawsuit or case may be commenced ; what kind of service of process ( if any ) is required ; the types of pleadings or statements of case , motions or applications , and orders allowed in civil cases ; the timing and manner of depositions and discovery or disclosure ; the conduct of trials ; the process for judgment ; the process for post-trial procedures ; various available remedies ; and how the courts and clerks must function .",
  "/wiki/Real_estate_law": "Real estate is property consisting of land and the buildings on it , along with its natural resources such as crops , minerals or water ; immovable property of this nature ; an interest vested in this ( also ) an item of real property , ( more generally ) buildings or housing in general .",
  "/wiki/Land_law": "Land law is the form of law that deals with the rights to use , alienate , or exclude others from land . In many jurisdictions , these kinds of property are referred to as real estate or real property , as distinct from personal property . Land use agreements , including renting , are an important intersection of property and contract law . Encumbrance on the land rights of one , such as an easement , may constitute the land rights of another . Mineral rights and water rights are closely linked , and often interrelated concepts . Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them ; for example , the claim clubs of the American West were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining . Squatting , the occupation of land without ownership , is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon .",
  "/wiki/Environmental_law": "Environmental law , also known as environmental and natural resources law , is a collective address environmental pollution . A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes , now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles , focus on the management of specific natural resources , such as forests , minerals , or fisheries . Other areas , such as environmental impact assessment , may not fit neatly into either category , but are nonetheless important components of environmental law .",

Most criminal law is established by statute , which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature . Criminal law includes the punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate such laws . Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction , and differs from civil law , where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation , rather than on punishment or rehabilitation .

Agricultural exceptionalism , i.e. , the use of legal exceptions to protect the agricultural industry , is pervasive , worldwide . American law schools and legal scholars first recognized agricultural law as a discipline in the 1940s when law schools at Yale , Harvard , Texas , and Iowa explored and initiated agricultural law courses . These early efforts were short-lived , however , and agricultural law as a distinct discipline did not resurface for three decades . In 1979 , a scholarly journal , The Agricultural Law Journal was initiated . In 1980 , the American Agricultural Law Association was formed and an advanced law degree program , the LL.M . Program in Agricultural Law was founded at the University of Arkansas School of Law . In 1981 , a fifteen volume Agricultural Law Treatise was published and in 1985 , the first law school casebook , Agricultural Law : Cases and Materials was published by West Publishing . In recent years , agricultural law studies have expanded to incorporate a wider consideration of the impact of agricultural production , including issues of environmental law , sustainability , animal welfare , and food law and policy .
