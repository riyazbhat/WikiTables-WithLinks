The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 .

However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

Labor is in government in the states of Victoria , Queensland , Western Australia , and in both the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory . The party competes against the Liberal/National Coalition for political office at the federal , state and sometimes local levels . It is the oldest political party in Australia . Labor 's constitution has long stated : The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry , production , distribution and exchange , to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields . This socialist objective was introduced in 1921 , but was later qualified by two further objectives : maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector and the right to own private property . Labor governments have not attempted the democratic socialisation of any industry since the 1940s , when the Chifley Government failed to nationalise the private banks , and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking . Labor 's current National Platform describes the party as a modern social democratic party .

Its main opponent is the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) ; the two forces are often regarded as operating in a two-party system . The Coalition has been in government since the 2013 federal election , most recently being re-elected in the 2019 Australian federal election . The group is led by Scott Morrison as Prime Minister of Australia since August 2018 . The two partners in the Coalition are the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia ( the latter previously known as the Country Party and the National Country Party ) . The parties have different voter bases , with the Liberals - the larger party - drawing most of their vote from urban areas and the Nationals operating almost exclusively in rural and regional areas . They occupy a broadly similar place on the political spectrum , although certain ideologies are more prevalent in each party . The partnership between the two current parties dates back to 1946 , shortly after the Liberal Party was formed , and has continued almost uninterrupted since then . The Country Party also maintained similar alliances with the Liberal Party 's predecessors , the United Australia Party and Nationalist Party , and similar parties at state level . The first such federal arrangement was formed in 1923 , as a solution to the hung parliament that resulted from the 1922 federal election . The Liberals and Nationals maintain separate organisational wings and separate parliamentary parties , but co-operate in various ways determined by a mixture of formal agreements and informal conventions . There is a single Coalition frontbench , both in government and in opposition , with each party receiving a proportionate number of positions .",
  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia": "The Liberal Party of Australia is a major centre-right political party in Australia , one of the two major parties in Australian politics , along with the centre-left Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) . It was founded in 1944 as the successor to the United Australia Party ( UAP ) . The Liberal Party is the largest and dominant party in the Coalition with the National Party of Australia . In two states and territories of Australia the parties have merged , forming the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Territory and the Liberal National Party of Queensland . Except for a few short periods , the Liberal Party and its predecessors have operated in similar coalitions since the 1920s . The party 's leader is Scott Morrison and its deputy leader is Josh Frydenberg . The pair were elected to their positions at the August 2018 Liberal leadership ballot , with Frydenberg and Morrison as replacements for Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull respectively , the latter of whom Morrison consequently succeeded as Prime Minister of Australia . Now the Morrison Government , the party had been elected at the 2013 federal election as the Abbott Government which took office on 18 September 2013 . At state and territory level , the Liberal Party is in office in three states : Peter Gutwein , Premier of Tasmania since 2020 , Gladys Berejiklian , Premier of New South Wales since 2017 and Steven Marshall , Premier of South Australia since 2018 . The party is in opposition in the states of Victoria , Queensland and Western Australia , and in both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory . The party 's ideology has been referred to as conservative , liberal-conservative , conservative-liberal , and classical liberal . The Liberal Party tends to promote economic liberalism ( which in the Australian usage refers to free markets and small government ) .",
  "/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia": "The National Party of Australia , also known as The Nationals or simply The Nats , is an Australian political party . Traditionally representing graziers , farmers , and rural voters generally , it began as the Australian Country Party in 1920 at a federal level . It would later briefly adopt the name National Country Party in 1975 , before adopting its current name in 1982 . Federally , and in New South Wales , and to an extent in Victoria and historically in Western Australia , it has in government been the minor party in a centre-right Coalition with the Liberal Party of Australia , and its leader has usually served as Deputy Prime Minister . In Opposition the Coalition was usually maintained , but otherwise still generally continued to work in co-operation with the Liberal Party of Australia ( and their predecessors the Nationalist Party of Australia and United Australia Party ) . In Queensland however , they were the senior coalition party between 1925 and 2008 , after which they merged with the junior Liberal Party of Australia to form the Liberal National Party ( LNP ) . Despite taking a conservative position politically , the National Party has long pursued agrarian socialist economic policies . Ensuring support for farmers either through government grants and subsidies or through community appeals is a major focus of National Party policy . The unusual hybrid of welfare and free market attitudes that characterise the party has led to it being often accused of seeking to privatise profits and socialise costs for the agricultural and mining sectors . [ by whom ? ] The current leader of the National Party is Michael McCormack , who won a leadership spill following Barnaby Joyce 's resignation in February 2018 . The most recent deputy leader of the Nationals , from 7 December 2017 until her resignation due to acting with a conflict of interest on 2 February 2020 , was Bridget McKenzie .",

Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy .

The Pakistan Awami Muslim League was established as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan and over centralisation of the government . The party quickly gained massive popular support in East Bengal , later named East Pakistan , and eventually led the forces of Bengali nationalism in the struggle against West Pakistan 's military and political establishment . The party under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , the founding father of Bangladesh , led the struggle for independence , first through massive populist and civil disobedience movements , such as the Six Point Movement and 1971 Non-Cooperation Movement , and then during the Bangladesh Liberation War . After the emergence of independent Bangladesh , the Awami League won the first general elections in 1973 but was overthrown in 1975 after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman .

In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms the Belgian part of this area was made into two political entities : the Flemish Community ( Dutch : Vlaamse Gemeenschap ) and the Flemish Region ( Dutch : Vlaams Gewest ) .

As the southern portion of the country , Wallonia is primarily French-speaking , and accounts for 55% of Belgium 's territory , but only a third of its population . The Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium , which is the political entity responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education , because the French Community of Belgium encompasses both Wallonia and the majority French-Speaking Brussels-Capital Region . The German-speaking minority in eastern Wallonia results from World War I and the subsequent annexation of three cantons that were initially part of the former German empire . This community represents less than 1% of the Belgian population . It forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium , which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues . During the industrial revolution , Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization , capitalizing on its extensive deposits of coal and iron . This brought the region wealth , and from the beginning of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century , Wallonia was the more prosperous half of Belgium . Since World War II , the importance of heavy industry has greatly diminished , and the Flemish Region surpassed Wallonia in wealth , as Wallonia declined economically .

  "/wiki/Parti_Socialiste_(Belgium)": "The Socialist Party ( French : Parti socialiste , PS ) is a social-democratic French-speaking political party in Belgium . As of the 2014 elections , it is the second largest party in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and the largest Francophone party . The party is led by Paul Magnette . The party supplies the Minister-president of the French Community ( Rudy Demotte ) , and the Brussels-Capital Region ( Rudi Vervoort ) . In the German-speaking community , the party is known as the Sozialistische Partei ( SP ) . The PS is very commonly part of governing coalitions , and dominates most local authorities because of the extremely fragmented nature of Belgian political institutions , particularly in Francophone areas . In the years since 1999 , the PS has simultaneously controlled five regional executive bodies : the Government of the French Community , the Walloon Government , the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region , as well as the COCOF , a local subsidiary in Brussels of the French Community Government , and the Government of the German-speaking Community . The party , or its members , have from time to time been brought into connection with criminal activities and political scandals , mostly concerning bribery and financial fraud ( Cools assassination , Agusta scandal , Dassault Affair , Carolor\u00e9gienne affair [ fr ] , ICDI affair ) . The Carolor\u00e9gienne affair caused Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe to step down as Minister-President of the Walloon region .",
  "/wiki/Citizens_Movement_for_Change": "Citizens ' Movement for Change ( French : Mouvement des Citoyens pour le Changement , MCC ) is a Christian-democratic political party in the French Community of Belgium founded by G\u00e9rard Deprez in 1998 . Deprez was the leader of the Francophone Christian Social Party ( PSC ) from 1982 to 1995 . He left the PSC , because he had failed to carry through his idea of forging a confederation of the PSC with the Liberal Reformist Party ( PRL ) . Moreover , he had been discontent with the election of Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb as party leader . The last trigger to form a new party was the popular outrage at the government 's mishandling of the controversy around the pedophile serial killer Marc Dutroux . The MCC immediately joined the alliance of the PRL and the regionalist Democratic Front of the Francophones ( FDF ) and ran on a joint PRL-FDF-MCC list for the elections in 1999 . Deprez was elected to the European Parliament and sat with the group of the European People 's Party ( EPP-ED ) . The MCC supported the purple-green government coalition of Liberals , Socialists and Greens , while the PSC , for the first time in 50 years , was sent into opposition . PRL , FDF and MCC became components of the Reformist Movement in 2002 . In the 2004 European Parliamentary Election it elected one MEP ( G. Deprez ) on the MR ticket . This time , he chose to sit with his liberal allies in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ( ALDE ) Group . The MCC became part of the pan-European European Democratic Party ( EDP ) .",
