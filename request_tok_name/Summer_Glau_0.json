  "/wiki/Freeform_(TV_channel)": "Freeform is an American basic cable channel owned by Walt Disney Television , a unit of Disney Media Networks and a part of The Walt Disney Company . Freeform primarily broadcasts programming geared toward teenagers and young adults - with some programming skewing toward young women - in the 14-34 age range , a target demographic designated by the channel as becomers . Its programming includes contemporary off-network syndicated reruns and original series , feature films , and made-for-TV original movies . Since the network was launched on April 29 , 1977 , it has undergone different changes to its programming format and naming under its four different owners . The network was founded as a religious channel , the CBN Satellite Service - an extension of televangelist Pat Robertson 's Christian Broadcasting Network . It evolved into a family-focused entertainment network in 1981 , and was spun off into a for-profit company known as International Family Entertainment ( IFE ) in 1990 , eventually becoming known as The Family Channel . As a condition of the spin-off , the channel was contractually required to maintain airings of The 700 Club and an annual telethon on the last Sunday in January ; these conditions have applied to all future owners of the channel . In 1997 , IFE and The Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between News Corporation and Saban Entertainment , resulting in its re-branding as the Fox Family Channel a year later . The new owners wanted to re-position the network towards younger viewers as a companion for their popular Fox Kids programming block . After the network began to struggle as a result of their changes , the venture was sold to Disney in October 2001 , in a sale that also included Saban ; the channel altered its name to ABC Family one month later on November 10 , 2001 . On October 6 , 2015 , Disney-ABC Television Group announced that the network would rebrand as Freeform , officially adopting that name on January 12 , 2016 . As of January 2016 , Freeform is available to 92 million households in the United States .",

  "/wiki/Kara_Zor-El": "Supergirl is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . The character was created by writer Otto Binder and designed by artist Al Plastino . Supergirl first appeared in a story published in Action Comics # 252 ( May 1959 ) titled The Supergirl from Krypton . Kara Zor-El is the biological cousin of Kal-El ( Superman ) . During the 1980s and the revolution of the Modern Age of Comics , Superman editors believed the character 's history had become too convoluted , and desired to re-establish Superman as The Last Son of Krypton . Supergirl was thus killed during the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths and retconned out of existence . In the decades following Crisis , several characters unrelated to Superman used the Supergirl alias . Kara Zor-El re-entered mainstream continuity in 2004 when DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio , along with editor Eddie Berganza and comic book writer Jeph Loeb , reintroduced the character in the Superman/Batman storyline The Supergirl from Krypton . The title paid homage to the original character 's 1959 debut . As the current Supergirl , Kara Zor-El stars in her own monthly comic book series . With DC 's 2011 relaunch , Kara , like most of the DC Universe , was revamped . DC relaunched the Supergirl comic in August 2016 as part of their DC Rebirth initiative .",
