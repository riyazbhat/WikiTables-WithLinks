  "/wiki/US_dollar": "The United States dollar ( sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US $ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar ) is the official currency of the United States and its territories per the Coinage Act of 1792 . One dollar is divided into 100 cents ( Symbol : \u00a2 ) or 1000 mills ( for accounting purposes and for taxing . Symbol : \u20a5 ) . The Coinage Act of 1792 created a decimal currency by creating the following coins : tenth dollar , one-twentieth dollar , one-hundredth dollar . In addition the act created the dollar , half dollar , and quarter dollar coins . All of these coins are still minted in 2020 . In addition , several forms of paper money were introduced by Congress over the years . The latest of these , the Federal Reserve Note , was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , while all existing U.S. currency remains legal tender . Issuance of the previous form of the currency ( U.S. notes ) was discontinued in January 1971 . As a result , currently circulating paper money consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars ( 12 U.S.C . \u00a7 418 ) . Since the suspension in 1971 of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into any precious metal , the U.S. dollar is de facto fiat money .",
  "/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco": "The University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) is a public research university in San Francisco , California . It is part of the University of California system and it is dedicated entirely to health science . It is a major center of medical and biological research and teaching . UCSF was founded as Toland Medical College in 1864 , and in 1873 it affiliated itself with the University of California , becoming its Medical Department . In the same year , it incorporated the California College of Pharmacy and in 1881 it established a dentistry school . Its facilities were located in both Berkeley and San Francisco . In 1964 , the school gained full administrative independence as a campus of the UC system headed by a chancellor , and in 1970 it gained its current name . Historically based at Parnassus Heights and several other locations throughout the city , in the early 2000s it developed a second major campus in the newly redeveloped Mission Bay . As of October 2018 , nine Nobel laureates have been affiliated with UCSF as faculty members or researchers , and the University has been the site of many scientific breakthroughs . The UCSF School of Medicine is the oldest medical school in the Western United States and is highly ranked by international and national rankings of prestige and funding . The UCSF Graduate Division offers 19 PhD programs , 11 MS programs , two certificates and a physical therapy program . UCSF is ranked 5th among research-oriented medical schools in the United States and ranked 3rd for primary care by U.S. News and World Report and is ranked 1st among medical schools in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( Clinical Medicine , 2019 ) .",
  "/wiki/National_Institute_of_Neurological_Disorders_and_Stroke": "The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) is a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . It conducts and funds research on brain and nervous system disorders and has a budget of just over US $ 2.03 billion . The mission of NINDS is to reduce the burden of neurological disease - a burden borne by every age group , every segment of society , and people all over the world . NINDS has established two major branches for research : an extramural branch that funds studies outside the NIH , and an intramural branch that funds research inside the NIH . Most of NINDS ' budget goes to fund extramural research . NINDS ' basic science research focuses on studies of the fundamental biology of the brain and nervous system , genetics , neurodegeneration , learning and memory , motor control , brain repair , and synapses . NINDS also funds clinical research related to diseases and disorders of the brain and nervous system , e.g . AIDS , Alzheimer disease , epilepsy , muscular dystrophy , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson disease , spinal cord injury , stroke , and traumatic brain injury . Established in 1950 by the U. S. Congress as the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness to help handle the casualties of World War II , NINDS grew along with the NIH . During the 1950s and 1960s , NINDS and the NIH had strong Congressional support and received significant appropriations . However , this funding declined in 1968 . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by relapsing episodes of psychosis . Major symptoms include hallucinations ( often hearing voices ) and delusions ( having beliefs not shared by others ) . Other symptoms include disordered thinking , social withdrawal , decreased emotional expression , and lack of motivation . Symptoms typically come on gradually , begin in young adulthood , and in many cases never resolve . There is no objective diagnostic test ; diagnosis is based on observed behavior , a history that includes the person 's reported experiences , and reports of others familiar with the person . To be diagnosed with schizophrenia , symptoms and functional impairment need to be present for six months . Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders that may include an anxiety disorder such as panic disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder , depressive disorder , or a substance use disorder . About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetimes . In 2017 , there were an estimated 1.1 million new cases and a total of 19.8 million cases globally . Males are more often affected and onset is on average earlier in age . The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors . Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city , cannabis use during adolescence , infections , the ages of a person 's parents , and poor nutrition during pregnancy .",

The NIH , in turn , is an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research . NIMH is the largest research organization in the world specializing in mental illness . Joshua A. Gordon is the current Director of NIMH . The institute was first authorized by the U.S. Government in 1946 , when then President Harry Truman signed into law the National Mental Health Act , although the institute was not formally established until 1949 . NIMH is a $ 1.5 billion enterprise , supporting research on mental health through grants to investigators at institutions and organizations throughout the United States and through its own internal ( intramural ) research effort . The mission of NIMH is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research , paving the way for prevention , recovery , and cure . In order to fulfill this mission , NIMH must foster innovative thinking and ensure that a full array of novel scientific perspectives are used to further discovery in the evolving science of brain , behavior , and experience . In this way , breakthroughs in science can become breakthroughs for all people with mental illnesses .",

  "/wiki/Center_for_Scientific_Review": "The Center for Scientific Review ( CSR ) is the portal for United States National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) grant applications and their review for scientific merit . The CSR organizes the peer review groups or study sections that evaluate the majority ( 70% ) of the research grant applications sent to NIH . It also receives all grant applications for NIH , as well as for some other components of the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) . Since 1946 , its mission has remained clear and timely : to see that NIH grant applications receive fair , independent , expert , and timely reviews - free from inappropriate influences - so NIH can fund the most promising research . CSR receives nearly 80,000 applications a year and recruits over 18,000 external experts to review its portion of them in its study sections , which often meet three times during the year . Additional scientists serve on other NIH advisory councils , which provide a second level of peer review and make funding recommendations based on priorities set by the United States Congress , DHHS , and the public . From 1946 to 1997 , the CSR was known as the Division of Research Grants ( DRG ) ."
