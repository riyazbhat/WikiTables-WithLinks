  "/wiki/Tara_TV": "Tara Television ( or Tara TV ) was an Irish cable and satellite channel aimed primarily at Irish people living in Britain , it was set up in 1996 and began broadcasting a year later before being finally wound up during the early hours of 1 July 2002 by the Irish High Court . The station was launched by a consortium that included Ireland 's state broadcaster , RT\u00c9 , and aired a compilation of shows that had previously been aired by RT\u00c9 in Ireland . It was initially carried by a number of cable providers , before being added to Sky Digital on 1 October 1998 . The channel 's original owners were RT\u00c9 , United Pan-Europe Communications ( owned by at the time by Dutch company United International Holdings , now part of Liberty Global ) and Riordan Communications ( involved in telecommunications companies active in rural Ireland ) . Tara Television had an exclusive option to purchase the majority of RT\u00c9 's programming , and this accounted for about 80% of the total programmes broadcast by the station , with the remainder being filled by programmes purchased from other networks . It mainly broadcast news bulletins and current affairs programming , as well as extensive coverage of Irish sport , in particular , GAA . RT\u00c9 made sure that from 16 July 2001 , Tara Television was blocked to Irish Sky subscribers as they feared loss of advertising revenue . It was anticipated that Tara would pay royalties RT\u00c9 to air these programmes , and it was also envisaged that this could eventually be extended to the United States , Canada and Australia . However , Tara was wound up in March 2002 in proceedings brought about by RT\u00c9 , who claimed non-payment of royalty fees from Tara . Tara was placed into examinership following the proceedings . An examiner , Ray Jackson of KPMG , was appointed and set out trying to place Tara back on a sound financial footing . Setanta Sports offered to take a majority shareholding in Tara and the restructured Tara offered to pay RT\u00c9 all the outstanding money owed .",
