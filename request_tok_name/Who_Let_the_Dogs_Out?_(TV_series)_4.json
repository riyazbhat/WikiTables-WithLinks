In the mid 1990s , Plymouth Argyle had wanted to build a completely new 25,000-seat stadium in the area , but these were scrapped soon afterwards in favour of redeveloping Home Park . There is also a new playground area , which is based on the continents of the world . This was demolished and rebuilt out of wood in 2018 as part of a \u00a39 million redevelopment project for the park . In 2007 the council opted to demolish the ageing Leisure Pools and Mayflower Leisure Centre rather than refurbish them , and replace them with a new larger combined indoor sports complex ( Plymouth Life Centre ) with multipurpose indoor pitches , basketball court , swimming pool and caf\u00e9 . By 2012 the Mayflower Leisure Centre and the Central Park Leisure Pools had been demolished , and the Plymouth Life Centre was officially opened on Saturday 24 March . The multimillion-pound redevelopment has provided the city with greatly enhanced access to sport and leisure pursuits , and has finally brought all indoor activities under the one roof . The new facility gives a vastly improved aesthetic to the area , as the previous buildings were very tatty , rundown and poorly maintained ."
