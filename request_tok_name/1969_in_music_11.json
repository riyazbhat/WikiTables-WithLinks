  "/wiki/Let_It_Bleed": "Let It Bleed is the eighth British and tenth American studio album by English rock band the Rolling Stones , released in December 1969 by Decca Records in the United Kingdom and London Records in the United States . Released shortly after the band 's 1969 American Tour , it is the follow-up to 1968 's Beggars Banquet . The album was recorded during a period of turmoil in the band ; Brian Jones , the band 's founder and original leader , had become increasingly unreliable in the studio due to heavy drug use , and during most recording sessions was either absent , or so incapacitated that he was unable to contribute meaningfully . He was fired in the midst of recording sessions for this album , and replaced by Mick Taylor . Jones appeared on this album on only two songs , playing backing instruments , and died within a month of being fired . Taylor had been hired after principal recording was complete on many of the tracks , and likewise appears on only two songs , having recorded some guitar overdubs . As such , Keith Richards was the band 's sole guitarist during most of the recording sessions ; being responsible for nearly all of the rhythm and lead parts . The other Stones members ( Mick Jagger , Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts ) appear on nearly every track , and significant additional contributions were made by percussionist Jimmy Miller ( who also produced the album ) , keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart , and numerous other guest musicians . The album charted as a top-ten album in several markets , including reaching number one in the UK and number three in the US . While no highly-charting singles were released from the album , many of the album 's songs became staples of Rolling Stones live shows and on rock radio stations for decades to come , including two gospel-infused songs , Gim me Shelter and You Ca n't Always Get What You Want , both of which ranked highly on retrospective best ever songs lists , including 2004 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine . It was voted number 40 in Colin Larkin 's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition ( 2000 ) .",
  "/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones": "The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962 . The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader Brian Jones ( guitar , harmonica , keyboards ) , Mick Jagger ( lead vocals , harmonica ) , Keith Richards ( guitar , vocals ) , Bill Wyman ( bass guitar ) , Charlie Watts ( drums ) , and Ian Stewart ( piano ) . Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985 . The band 's primary songwriters , Jagger and Richards , assumed leadership after Andrew Loog Oldham became the group 's manager . Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969 , having already been replaced by Mick Taylor . Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood who has since remained . Since Wyman 's departure in 1993 , Darryl Jones has served as touring bassist . The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963 , but have employed several musicians in that role , including Jack Nitzsche ( 1965-1971 ) , Nicky Hopkins ( 1967-1982 ) , Billy Preston ( 1971-1981 ) , Ian McLagan ( 1978-1981 ) , and Chuck Leavell ( 1982-present ) . The Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s . Rooted in blues and early rock and roll , the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material ; songs such as ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction and Paint It Black became international hits , and Aftermath ( 1966 ) - their first entirely original album - has been considered the most important of the band 's formative records . After a short period of experimentation with psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s , the group returned to its bluesy roots with Beggars Banquet ( 1968 ) , Let It Bleed ( 1969 ) , Sticky Fingers ( 1971 ) , and Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) . It was during this period they were first introduced on stage as The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World .",
  "/wiki/Diana_Ross_Presents_The_Jackson_5": "Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5 is the debut studio album from Gary , Indiana-based soul family band the Jackson 5 , released on the Motown label in December 1969 . The Jackson 5 's lead singer , a preteenage boy named Michael ( who later became a universally-recognized pop star on his own and The King of Pop ) , and his older brothers Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , and Marlon , became pop successes within months of this album 's release . Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 's only single , I Want You Back , became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 within weeks of the album 's release and eventually sold five million copies worldwide . The album reached number 5 on the Pop Albums chart , and spent nine weeks at No . 1 on the R & B/Black Albums chart . The album title suggested that Motown star Diana Ross had discovered the group , as do the Ross-penned liner notes on the back cover . Ross ' supposed discovery of the Jackson 5 was in fact part of Motown 's marketing and promotions plan for the Jackson 5 ; it may actually have been Motown producer Bobby Taylor who discovered the Jacksons . Joe Jackson , the father and manager of the Jackson 5 , thanked the lovely Gladys Knight , ( who ) extended a helping hand to our family , by calling Motown Executives and talking their ear off to take time out of their schedule and meet with us . She believed in us before others . Always grateful to her . ( Gladys Knight also said she brought the Jackson 5 to Motown 's attention . ) But Ross embraced her assigned role and helped promote the group , especially grooming young Michael Jackson as a star .",

  "/wiki/Deep_Purple": "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968 . The band is considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock , although their musical approach changed over the years . Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band , the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970 . Deep Purple , together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath , have been referred to as the unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies . They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as the globe 's loudest band for a 1972 concert at London 's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide . Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus ( 1976-1984 ) . The 1968-1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I , II , III and IV . Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan ( vocals ) , Jon Lord ( keyboards ) , Roger Glover ( bass ) , Ian Paice ( drums ) , and Ritchie Blackmore ( guitar ) . This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993 . The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans ( lead vocals ) and Nick Simper ( bass , backing vocals ) , between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale ( lead vocals ) and Glenn Hughes ( bass , vocals ) ( and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975 ) , and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner ( vocals ) . The band 's line-up ( currently including Ian Gillan , and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994 ) has been much more stable in recent years , although keyboardist Jon Lord 's retirement from the band in 2002 ( being succeeded by Don Airey ) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band . Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1 's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme , and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the most influential bands ever .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Philharmonic_Orchestra": "The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ( RPO ) , based in London , is a British Orchestra that was formed by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946 . In its early days , the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society . After Beecham 's death in 1961 the orchestra 's fortunes declined steeply ; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s , when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy ; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra 's right to call itself Royal could be withdrawn . Since Beecham 's death , the RPO has had seven chief conductors , including Rudolf Kempe , Antal Dor\u00e1ti , Andr\u00e9 Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy . Others closely associated with the orchestra have included Sir Charles Groves , Sir Charles Mackerras , Peter Maxwell Davies , Yehudi Menuhin and Leopold Stokowski . In 2004 , the orchestra acquired its first permanent London base , at the new Cadogan Hall in Chelsea . The RPO also gives concerts at the Royal Festival Hall , the Royal Albert Hall and venues around the UK and other countries . From its earliest days , the orchestra has been active in the recording studios , making film soundtracks and numerous gramophone recordings ; many of the LP recordings conducted by Beecham and others have been reissued on compact disc .",

Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s .

  "/wiki/Liege_&_Lief": "Liege & Lief is the fourth album by the English folk rock band Fairport Convention . It is the third album the group released in the UK during 1969 , all of which prominently feature Sandy Denny as lead female vocalist ( Denny did not appear on the group 's 1968 debut album ) , as well as the first to feature future long-serving personnel Dave Swarbrick and Dave Mattacks on violin/mandolin and drums , respectively , as full band members ( Swarbrick had previously guested on Unhalfbricking ) . It is also the first Fairport album on which all songs have either been adapted ( freely ) from traditional British and Celtic folk material ( for example Matty Groves , Tam Lin ) , or else are original compositions ( such as Come All Ye , Crazy Man Michael ) written and performed in a similar style . Although Denny ( and also founding member , the bass player Ashley Hutchings ) quit the band even before the album 's release , Fairport Convention has continued to the present day to make music strongly based within the British folk rock idiom , and are still the band most prominently associated with it . The album was moderately successful , peaking at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart during a 15-week run . It is often credited , though the claim is sometimes disputed , as the first major British folk rock album ( this term is not to be confused with American-style folk rock , which had first achieved mainstream popularity on both sides of the Atlantic with The Byrds ' early work several years prior ) . The popularity of Liege & Lief did a great deal to establish the new style commercially and artistically as a distinct genre . In an audience vote at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2006 , the album was voted Most Influential Folk Album of All Time . It was voted number 254 in the third edition of Colin Larkin 's All Time Top 1000 Albums ( 2000 ) .",
  "/wiki/Fairport_Convention": "Fairport Convention are a British folk rock band , formed in 1967 by Richard Thompson ( guitar , vocals ) , Simon Nicol ( guitar , vocals ) , Ashley Hutchings ( bass guitar ) , and Shaun Frater ( drums , percussion ) , with Frater replaced by Martin Lamble after their first gig . They started out heavily influenced by American folk rock and singer-songwriter material , with a setlist dominated by Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell songs and a sound that earned them the nickname 'the British Jefferson Airplane ' . Vocalists Judy Dyble and Iain Matthews joined them before the recording of their self-titled debut in 1968 ; afterwards , Dyble was replaced by Sandy Denny , with Matthews leaving during the recording of their third album . Denny began steering the group towards traditional British music for their next two albums , What We Did on Our Holidays and Unhalfbricking ( both 1969 ) ; the latter featured fiddler Dave Swarb Swarbrick , most notably on the song A Sailor 's Life , which laid the groundwork for British folk rock by being the first time a traditional British song was combined with a rock beat . However , shortly before the album 's release , a crash on the M1 killed Lamble and Thompson 's then-girlfriend , Jeannie Franklyn ; this resulted in the group retiring most of their prior material and turning entirely towards British folk music for their seminal album Liege & Lief , released the same year , with this style being the band 's focus ever since . For this album Swarbrick joined full-time alongside Dave Mattacks on drums . Both Denny and Hutchings left before the year 's end ; the latter replaced by Dave Pegg , who has remained the group 's sole consistent member to this day ; and Thompson would leave after the recording of 1970 's Full House . The 1970s saw numerous lineup changes around the core of Swarbrick and Pegg - Nicol being absent for the middle of the decade - and declining fortunes as folk music fell out of mainstream favour . Denny , whose partner Trevor Lucas had been a guitarist in the group since 1972 , returned for the pop-orientated Rising for the Moon album in 1975 in a final bid to crack America ; this effort failed , and after three more albums minus Denny or Lucas , the group disbanded in 1979 . They played a farewell concert in the village of Cropredy , Oxfordshire , where they had held small concerts since 1976 , and this marked the beginning of the Cropredy Festival ( since 2005 known as Fairport 's Cropredy Convention ) which has become the largest folk festival in Britain , with annual attendances of 20,000 . The band was reformed by Nicol , Pegg , and Mattacks in 1985 , joined by Maartin Allcock ( guitar , vocals ) and Ric Sanders ( fiddle , keyboards ) , and they have remained active since . Allcock was replaced by Chris Leslie in 1996 , and Gerry Conway replaced Mattacks in 1998 , with this lineup remaining unchanged since and marking the longest-lasting of the group 's history .",
