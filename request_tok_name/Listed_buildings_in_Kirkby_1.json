  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Casement_window": "A casement is a window that is attached to its frame by one or more hinges at the side . They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame , in which case they are hinged on the outside . Casement windows are often held open using a casement stay . Windows hinged at the top are referred to as awning windows , and ones hinged at the bottom are called hoppers .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Bay_window": "A bay window is a window space projecting outward from the main walls of a building and forming a bay in a room .",
  "/wiki/Mullion": "A mullion is a vertical element that forms a division between units of a window or screen , or is used decoratively . When dividing adjacent window units its primary purpose is a rigid support to the glazing of the window . Its secondary purpose is to provide structural support to an arch or lintel above the window opening . Horizontal elements separating the head of a door from a window above are both a head jamb and horizontal mullion and are called transoms .",
  "/wiki/Transom_(architecture)": "In architecture , a transom is a transverse horizontal structural beam or bar , or a crosspiece separating a door from a window above it . This contrasts with a mullion , a vertical structural member . Transom or transom window is also the customary U.S. word used for a transom light , the window over this crosspiece . In Britain , the transom light is usually referred to as a fanlight , often with a semi-circular shape , especially when the window is segmented like the slats of a folding hand fan . A well-known example of this is at the main entrance of 10 Downing Street , London .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Bay_(architecture)": "In architecture , a bay is the space between architectural elements , or a recess or compartment . The term bay comes from Old French baee , meaning an opening or hole .",
  "/wiki/Sash_window": "A sash window or hung sash window is made of one or more movable panels , or sashes , [ A ] that form a frame to hold panes of glass , which are often separated from other panes ( or lights ) by glazing bars , also known as muntins in the US ( moulded strips of wood ) . Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash , the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically , or horizontally in a style known as a Yorkshire light , sliding sash , or sash and case ( so called because the weights are concealed in a box case ) .",
  "/wiki/Pilaster": "In classical architecture , a pilaster is an architectural element used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall , with only an ornamental function . It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Fanlight": "A fanlight is a window , often semicircular or semi-elliptical in shape , with glazing bars or tracery sets radiating out like an open fan . It is placed over another window or a doorway , and is sometimes hinged to a transom . The bars in the fixed glazed window spread out in the manner of a sunburst . It is also called a sunburst light .",
  "/wiki/Dormer": "A dormer is a roofed structure , often containing a window , that projects vertically beyond the plane of a pitched roof . A dormer window is a form of roof window . Dormers are commonly used to increase the usable space in a loft and to create window openings in a roof plane . The term dormer is commonly used to refer to a dormer window although a dormer does not necessarily contain a window . A dormer is often one of the primary elements of a loft conversion . As a prominent element of many buildings , different types of dormer have evolved to complement different styles of architecture . When the structure appears on the spires of churches and cathedrals , it is usually referred to as a lucarne .",
  "/wiki/Bargeboard": "Bargeboard ( probably from Medieval Latin bargus , or barcus , a scaffold , and not from the now obsolete synonym vergeboard ) is a board fastened to the projecting gables of a roof to give them strength , protection , and to conceal the otherwise exposed end of the horizontal timbers or purlins of the roof to which they were attached . Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved , but as a rule the lower edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise elaborated . An example in Britain was one at Ockwells in Berkshire ( built 1446-1465 ) , which was moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work . In New Orleans , bargeboard is the wood from which many of the creole cottages were constructed in the early to mid-1800s . Barges were constructed up-river to carry goods to New Orleans , and upon arrival dismantled and used for construction of houses . The planks are generally 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) thick and of varying lengths and widths , although 10 inches ( 25 cm ) width is common . It is hard , solid wood that has lasted between 150 and 200 years in a wet , humid climate . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",
  "/wiki/Cornice": "In architecture , a cornice ( from the Italian cornice meaning ledge ) is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the cornice over a door or window , for instance , or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall . A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown . A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of the building 's walls . In residential building practice , this function is handled by projecting gable ends , roof eaves , and gutters . However , house eaves may also be called cornices if they are finished with decorative molding . In this sense , while most cornices are also eaves ( in that they overhang the sides of the building ) , not all eaves are usually considered cornices - eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative , and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it . The projecting cornice of a building may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling , particularly on commercial buildings , but often it may be very light , made of pressed metal .",
  "/wiki/Modillion": "A modillion is an ornate bracket , a corbel , such as underneath a cornice which it helps to support , more elaborate than dentils ( literally translated as small teeth ) . All three are selectively used as adjectival historic past participles ( modillioned , corbelled , dentillated ) as to what co-supports or simply adorns any high structure of a building , such as a terrace of a roof ( flat area of a roof ) , parapet , pediment/entablature , balcony , cornice band or roof cornice . They occur classically under a Corinthian or a Composite cornice , but may support any type of eaves cornice . They may be carved or plain .",

  "/wiki/Paley_and_Austin": "Sharpe , Paley and Austin are the surnames of architects who practised in Lancaster , Lancashire , England , between 1835 and 1946 , working either alone or in partnership . The full names of the principals in their practice , which went under various names during its life , are Edmund Sharpe ( 1809-77 ) ; Edward Graham Paley ( 1823-97 ) , who practised as E. G. Paley ; Hubert James Austin ( 1841-1915 ) ; Henry Anderson Paley ( 1859-1946 ) , son of Edward , usually known as Harry Paley ; and , for a very brief period , Geoffrey Langshaw Austin ( 1884-1971 ) , son of Hubert . The firm 's commissions were mainly for buildings in Lancashire and what is now Cumbria , but also in Yorkshire , Cheshire , the West Midlands , North Wales , and Hertfordshire . The practice specialised in work on churches ; the design of new churches , restoring older churches , and making additions or alterations . They also designed country houses , and made alterations to existing houses . Almost all their churches were designed in Gothic Revival style , except for some of Sharpe 's earliest churches and a few designed later by the practice . Within the Gothic Revival style , the practice initially used Early English and , particularly , Decorated features . E. G. Paley introduced Perpendicular elements , and Perpendicular became the dominant style used by the practice following the arrival of Hubert Austin , to such a degree that the firm became regarded as the regional leader in the use of that style . The practice used a greater variety of styles when working on country houses , including Elizabethan and Jacobean elements as well as Gothic . Other features were incorporated towards the end of the 19th century similar to those in works produced by the Aesthetic and the Arts and Crafts Movements . Not all the firm 's work was on a large scale ; as the major architectural practice in North West England they also undertook work on schools , vicarages , hospitals , factories , hotels , shops , railway stations , and war memorials .",
  "/wiki/Norman_architecture": "The term Norman architecture is used to categorise styles of Romanesque architecture developed by the Normans in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries . In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture . The Normans introduced large numbers of castles and fortifications including Norman keeps , and at the same time monasteries , abbeys , churches and cathedrals , in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded arches ( particularly over windows and doorways ) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Clerestory": "In architecture , a clerestory ( /\u02c8kl\u026a\u0259rst\u0254\u02d0ri/ KLEER-stor-ee ; lit . clear storey , also clearstory , clearstorey , or overstorey ) is a high section of wall that contains windows above eye level . The purpose is to admit light , fresh air , or both . Historically , clerestory denoted an upper level of a Roman basilica or of the nave of a Romanesque or Gothic church , the walls of which rise above the rooflines of the lower aisles and are pierced with windows . Similar structures have been used in transportation vehicles to provide additional lighting , ventilation , or headroom .",
  "/wiki/Aisle": "An aisle ( British English : gangway ) is , in general ( common ) , a space for walking with rows of seats on both sides or with rows of seats on one side and a wall on the other . Aisles can be seen in airplanes , certain types of buildings , such as churches , cathedrals , synagogues , meeting halls , parliaments and legislatures , courtrooms , theatres , and in certain types of passenger vehicles . Their floors may be flat or , as in theatres , stepped upwards from a stage . Aisles can also be seen in shops , warehouses , and factories , where rather than seats , they have shelving to either side . In warehouses and factories , aisles may consist of storage pallets , and in factories , aisles may separate work areas . In health clubs , exercise equipment is normally arranged in aisles . Aisles are distinguished [ how ? ] from corridors , hallways , walkways , footpaths/pavements ( American English sidewalks ) , trails , paths and ( enclosed ) open areas .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Crossing_(architecture)": "A crossing , in ecclesiastical architecture , is the junction of the four arms of a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) church . In a typically oriented church ( especially of Romanesque and Gothic styles ) , the crossing gives access to the nave on the west , the transept arms on the north and south , and the choir , as the first part of the chancel , on the east . The crossing is sometimes surmounted by a tower or dome . A large crossing tower is particularly common on English Gothic cathedrals . With the Renaissance , building a dome above the crossing became popular . Because the crossing is open on four sides , the weight of the tower or dome rests heavily on the corners ; a stable construction thus required great skill on the part of the builders . In centuries past , it was not uncommon for overambitious crossing towers to collapse . Sacrist Alan of Walsingham 's octagon , built between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of Ely 's nave crossing on 22 February 1322 , is the . greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral according to architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner . A tower over the crossing may be called a lantern tower if it has openings through which light from outside can shine down to the crossing . In Early Medieval churches , the crossing square was often used as a module , or a unit of measurement . The nave and transept would have lengths that were a certain multiple of the length of the crossing square .",
  "/wiki/Saddleback_roof": "A saddleback roof is usually on a tower , with a ridge and two sloping sides , producing a gable at each end .",
  "/wiki/Pargetting": "Pargeting ( or sometimes pargetting ) is a decorative or waterproofing plastering applied to building walls . The term , if not the practice , is particularly associated with the English counties of Suffolk and Essex . In the neighbouring county of Norfolk the term pinking is used . Patrick Leigh Fermor describes similar decorations on pre-World War II buildings in Linz , Austria . Pargeted fa\u00e7ades rose up , painted chocolate , green , purple , cream and blue . They were adorned with medallions in high relief and the stone and plaster scroll-work gave them a feeling of motion and flow . Pargeting derives from the word 'parget ' , a Middle English term that is probably derived from the Old French pargeter or parjeter , to throw about , or porgeter , to roughcast a wall . However , the term is more usually applied only to the decoration in relief of the plastering between the studwork on the outside of half-timber houses , or sometimes covering the whole wall . The devices were stamped on the wet plaster . This seems generally to have been done by sticking a number of pins in a board in certain lines or curves , and then pressing on the wet plaster in various directions , so as to form geometrical figures . Sometimes these devices are in relief , and in the time of Elizabeth I of England represent figures , birds and foliage . Fine examples can be seen at Ipswich , Maidstone , Newark-on-Trent .",
  "/wiki/Plinth": "A pedestal ( from French pi\u00e9destal , Italian piedistallo , foot of a stall ) or plinth is the support of a statue or a vase , and of a column in architecture . Smaller pedestals , especially if round in shape may be called socles . An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it ( typically roofs or corniches ) is sometimes called an acropodium . The term is from the Greek akros or topmost and pous ( root pod- ) or foot .",
  "/wiki/Ball_flower": "The ball-flower ( also written ballflower ) is an architectural ornament in the form of a ball inserted in the cup of a flower . It came into use in the latter part of the 13th century in England and became one of the chief ornaments of the 14th century , in the period known as Decorated Gothic . Ball-flowers were generally placed in rows at equal distances in the hollow of a moulding , frequently by the sides of mullions . Examples are found in many churches of the period including Gloucester Cathedral , St Mary 's Church , Bloxham , St. Michael 's Church , Swaton ( 1300 ) , and Tewkesbury Abbey ( 1330 ) . The presence of ball-flowers on the west part of Salisbury Cathedral has helped date this facade to the 14th century .",
  "/wiki/Relief": "Relief is a sculptural technique where the sculpted elements remain attached to a solid background of the same material . The term relief is from the Latin verb relevo , to raise . To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background plane . What is actually performed when a relief is cut in from a flat surface of stone ( relief sculpture ) or wood ( relief carving ) is a lowering of the field , leaving the unsculpted parts seemingly raised . The technique involves considerable chiselling away of the background , which is a time-consuming exercise . On the other hand , a relief saves forming the rear of a subject , and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round , especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point , especially in stone . In other materials such as metal , clay , plaster stucco , ceramics or papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 the form can be just added to or raised up from the background , and monumental bronze reliefs are made by casting . There are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field , for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English . The full range includes high relief ( alto-rilievo , haut-relief ) , where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas , mid-relief ( mezzo-rilievo ) , low-relief ( basso-rilievo , or French : bas-relief ( ) , and shallow-relief or rilievo schiacciato , where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements . There is also sunk relief , which was mainly restricted to Ancient Egypt ( see below ) . However , the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important , and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work . The definition of these terms is somewhat variable , and many works combine areas in more than one of them , sometimes sliding between them in a single figure ; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions .",
  "/wiki/Chi_Rho": "The Chi Rho ( ; also known as chrismon or sigla ) is one of the earliest forms of christogram , formed by superimposing the first two ( capital ) letters - chi and rho ( \u03a7\u03a1 ) - of the Greek word ( Christos ) in such a way that the vertical stroke of the rho intersects the center of the chi . The Chi-Rho symbol was used by the Roman emperor Constantine I ( r. 306-337 ) as part of a military standard ( vexillum ) . Constantine 's standard was known as the Labarum . Early symbols similar to the Chi Rho were the Staurogram ( ) and the IX monogram ( ) . In pre-Christian times , the Chi-Rho symbol was also to mark a particularly valuable or relevant passage in the margin of a page , abbreviating chr\u0113ston ( good ) . Some coins of Ptolemy III Euergetes ( r. 246-222 BC ) were marked with a Chi-Rho . Although formed of Greek characters , the device ( or its separate parts ) is frequently found serving as an abbreviation in Latin text , with endings added appropriate to a Latin noun , thus XPo , signifying Christo , to Christ , the dative form of Christus . The Chi Rho symbol has two Unicode codepoints : in the Miscellaneous symbols block and in the Coptic block . __toc__",
  "/wiki/Pier_(architecture)": "A pier , in architecture , is an upright support for a structure or superstructure such as an arch or bridge . Sections of structural walls between openings ( bays ) can function as piers .",
  "/wiki/Niche_(architecture)": "A niche ( , or ) in classical architecture is an exedra or an apse that has been reduced in size , retaining the half-dome heading usual for an apse . Nero 's Domus Aurea ( AD 64-69 ) was the first semi-private dwelling that possessed rooms that were given richly varied floor plans , shaped with niches and exedras ; sheathed in dazzling polished white marble , such curved surfaces concentrated or dispersed the daylight . The word derives from the Latin nidus or nest , via the French niche . The Italian nicchio for a sea-shell may also be involved , as the traditional decoration for the top of a niche is a scallop shell , as in the illustration , hence also the alternative term of conch for a semi-dome , usually reserved for larger exedra . In Gothic architecture , a niche may be set within a tabernacle framing , like a richly decorated miniature house ( aedicule ) , such as might serve for a reliquary . The backings for the altars in churches ( reredos ) can be embedded with niches for statues . Though a niche in either Classical or Gothic contexts may be empty and merely provide some articulation and variety to a section of wall , the cult origins of the niche suggested that it be filled with a statue . One of the earliest buildings which uses external niches containing statues is the Church of Orsanmichele in Florence , built between 1380 and 1404 . The Uffizi Palace in Florence ( 1560-81 ) modified the concept by setting the niche within the wall so it did not protrude . The Uffizi has two dozen or so such niches containing statues of great historical figures . In England the Uffizi style niches were adopted at Montacute House ( c. 1598 ) , where there are nine exterior niches containing statues of the Nine Worthies . In Fra Filippo Lippi 's Madonna , the trompe-l'oeil niche frames her as with the canopy of estate that was positioned over a personage of importance in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern Europe ."
