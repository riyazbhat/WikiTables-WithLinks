  "/wiki/Paul_Baran": "Paul Baran ( born Pesach Baran /\u02c8b\u00e6r\u0259n/ ; April 29 , 1926 - March 26 , 2011 ) was a Polish-American engineer who was a pioneer in the development of computer networks . He was one of the two independent inventors of packet switching , which is today the dominant basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide , and went on to start several companies and develop other technologies that are an essential part of modern digital communication .",
  "/wiki/Packet_switching": "Packet switching is a method of grouping data that is transmitted over a digital network into packets . Packets are made of a header and a payload . Data in the header are used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination where the payload is extracted and used by application software . Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide . In the early 1960s , American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant , efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation , funded by the US Department of Defense . This concept contrasted with , and contradicted , then-established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth , largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System . The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of British computer scientist Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory ( United Kingdom ) in 1965 . Davies is credited with coining the modern term packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in the decade following , including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Internet": "The Internet ( portmanteau of interconnected network ) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) to link devices worldwide . It is a network of networks that consists of private , public , academic , business , and government networks of local to global scope , linked by a broad array of electronic , wireless , and optical networking technologies . The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services , such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , electronic mail , telephony , and file sharing . The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication with computer networks . The primary precursor network , the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s . The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial extensions , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks . The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet , and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional , personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network . Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s , commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life . Most traditional communication media , including telephony , radio , television , paper mail and newspapers are reshaped , redefined , or even bypassed by the Internet , giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers , and video streaming websites . Newspaper , book , and other print publishing are adapting to website technology , or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online .",
  "/wiki/Michael_Behe": "Michael J. Behe ( /\u02c8bi\u02d0hi\u02d0/ BEE-hee ; born January 18 , 1952 ) is an American biochemist , author , and advocate of the pseudoscientific principle of intelligent design ( ID ) . He serves as professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and as a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute 's Center for Science and Culture . Behe is best known as an advocate for the validity of the argument for irreducible complexity ( IC ) , which claims that some biochemical structures are too complex to be explained by known evolutionary mechanisms and are therefore probably the result of intelligent design . Behe has testified in several court cases related to intelligent design , including the court case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District where his views were cited in the ruling that intelligent design is not science and is religious in nature . Behe 's claims about the irreducible complexity of essential cellular structures have been rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community , and his own biology department at Lehigh University published a statement repudiating Behe 's views and intelligent design .",
  "/wiki/Pseudoscientific": "Pseudoscience consists of statements , beliefs , or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method . [ Note 1 ] Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory , exaggerated or unfalsifiable claims ; reliance on confirmation bias rather than rigorous attempts at refutation ; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts ; absence of systematic practices when developing hypotheses ; and continued adherence long after the pseudoscientific hypotheses have been experimentally discredited . The term pseudoscience is considered pejorative , because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively . Those described as practicing or advocating pseudoscience often dispute the characterization . The demarcation between science and pseudoscience has philosophical and scientific implications . Differentiating science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of health care , expert testimony , environmental policies , and science education . Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs , such as those found in astrology , alchemy , alternative medicine , occult beliefs , religious beliefs , and creation science , is part of science education and scientific literacy . Pseudoscience can be harmful . For example , pseudoscientific anti-vaccine activism and promotion of homeopathic remedies as alternative disease treatments can result in people forgoing important medical treatment with demonstrable health benefits .",
  "/wiki/Intelligent_design": "Intelligent design ( ID ) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God , presented by its proponents as an evidence-based scientific theory about life 's origins . Proponents claim that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a Christian , politically conservative think tank based in the United States . [ n 1 ] Though the phrase intelligent design had featured previously in theological discussions of the argument from design , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . [ n 2 ] ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design .",

  "/wiki/David_H._Geiger": "David H. Geiger ( 1935 - October 3 , 1989 ) was an engineer who invented the air-supported fabric roof system that at the time of his death was in use at almost half the domed stadiums in the world . Geiger was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , received a bachelor 's degree from Drexel University , master 's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and PhD in engineering from Columbia University . While an adjunct professor at Columbia University , Geiger designed the enclosure for the United States pavilion at Expo 70 in Osaka , Japan . He had been tapped after the architecture firm Davis Brody won the design contest for the building . Davis Brody 's winning design was a 30-story high air filled pumpkin atop the pavilion and they needed an engineer with the expertise to implement it . Geiger was designing the US Pavilion to be capable of withstanding Japan 's earthquakes and typhoons when Congress approved only half of the expected budget . To accommodate the new budget , he drastically cut the proposed height and used a low profile cable-restrained air-supported roof , employing a super-elliptical perimeter compression ring and diagonally-run pattern of cables which prevented fabric sag around the perimeter . Geiger 's fabric air-supported roof invention was significantly cheaper than the largest fixed dome structure of the day : the Astrodome . He then joined with engineer Horst Berger to form Geiger Berger Associates and they went on to produce designs for a series of low-cost air-supported structures including the first tensegrity type dome for the Olympic Gymnastics Venue , Seoul , Korea ( which had been inspired by the work of R. Buckminster Fuller ) , first translucent insulated fabric roof at Lindsay Park Sports Centre , Calgary , Alberta , Canada , first permanent low profile air-supported fabric roof to cover a stadium at the Silverdome in Pontiac , Michigan . The partnership with Berger dissolved in 1983 and Geiger formed Geiger Associates , which was acquired by KKBNA in 1986 . In 1988 , Geiger in partnership with former colleagues from Geiger Associates went on to found Geiger Engineers . Geiger died in 1989 while traveling in Seoul where he had designed three venues for the 1988 Olympics .",
  "/wiki/Air-supported_structure": "An air-supported ( or air-inflated ) structure is any building that derives its structural integrity from the use of internal pressurized air to inflate a pliable material ( i.e . structural fabric ) envelope , so that air is the main support of the structure , and where access is via airlocks . The concept was implemented on a large scale by David H. Geiger with the United States pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka , Japan in 1970 . It is usually dome-shaped , since this shape creates the greatest volume for the least amount of material . To maintain structural integrity , the structure must be pressurized such that the internal pressure equals or exceeds any external pressure being applied to the structure ( i.e . wind pressure ) . The structure does not have to be airtight to retain structural integrity - as long as the pressurization system that supplies internal pressure replaces any air leakage , the structure will remain stable . All access to the structure interior must be equipped with some form of airlock - typically either two sets of parallel doors or a revolving door or both . Air-supported structures are secured by heavy weights on the ground , ground anchors , attachement to a foundation , or a combination of these . Among its many uses are : sports and recreation facilities , warehousing , temporary shelters , and radomes . The structure can be either wholly , partial , or roof-only air supported . A fully air-supported structure can be intended to be a temporary or semi-temporary facility or permanent , whereas a structure with only an air-supported roof can be built as a permanent building .",

Pausanias noted that for about half a century the only event at the ancient Greek Olympic festival was the race that comprised one length of the stadion at Olympia , where the word stadium originated . Most of the stadiums with a capacity of at least 10,000 are used for association football . Other popular stadium sports include gridiron football , baseball , cricket , the various codes of rugby , field lacrosse , bandy , and bullfighting . Many large sports venues are also used for concerts .",

These vessels transport blood cells , nutrients , and oxygen to the tissues of the body . They also take waste and carbon dioxide away from the tissues . Blood vessels are needed to sustain life , because all of the bodys tissues rely on their functionality . There are five types of blood vessels : the arteries , which carry the blood away from the heart ; the arterioles ; the capillaries , where the exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues occurs ; the venules ; and the veins , which carry blood from the capillaries back towards the heart . The word vascular , meaning relating to the blood vessels , is derived from the Latin vas , meaning vessel .

  "/wiki/Manhattan_Project": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons . It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $ 2 billion ( about $ 23 billion in 2018 dollars ) . Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada . Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war : a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon . The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium , and therefore a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235 , an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium . Chemically identical to the most common isotope , uranium-238 , and with almost the same mass , it proved difficult to separate the two .",

  "/wiki/PRICE_Systems": "PRICE Systems was founded in 1975 as a business within the RCA Corporation . It is generally acknowledged as the earliest developer of parametric cost estimation software . [ citation needed ] PRICE Systems cost estimating software was first developed in the 1970s when David Shore , a vice president in RCA 's Government Group discovered that Frank Freiman , in the purchasing department , was able to predict the cost of military new systems with considerable accuracy before design was completed and a parts breakdown was available for cost estimation . Mr . Shore teamed Freiman with William Rapp , who transferred Freiman 's relationships to software that could be run on a computer . This was used in a proposal RCA made to the USAF . When questioned by the Air Force , a presentation was made to them by Shore , Freiman and Rapp . The USAF demanded that RCA make this capability available to the entire industry as a condition for accepting its use . Shore established a new group to be headed by Freiman to develop and run an organization which Freiman named Programmed Review of Information for Costing and Evaluation ( PRICE ) . PRICE related the basic costs of engineering and production to parameters that included a specification profile of units to be built , amount of work to be performed , the allowed schedule and resources available . It relied on the use of parametric relationships obtained through curve-fitting procedures that had been performed on a historical repository of significant cost data . Originally a division of RCA and later a strategic business unit of Lockheed Martin , PRICE Systems is considered the pioneer in the science of parametric modeling because the PRICE parametric models were the first generally available computerized cost estimation software .",

  "/wiki/Barcode": "A barcode or bar code is a method of representing data in a visual , machine-readable form . Initially , barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines . These barcodes , now commonly referred to as linear or one-dimensional ( 1D ) , can be scanned by special optical scanners , called barcode readers . Later , two-dimensional ( 2D ) variants were developed , using rectangles , dots , hexagons and other geometric patterns , called matrix codes or 2D barcodes , although they do not use bars as such . 2D barcodes can be read or deconstructed using application software on mobile devices with inbuilt cameras , such as smartphones . The barcode was invented by Norman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver and patented in the US in 1951 . The invention was based on Morse code that was extended to thin and thick bars . However , it took over twenty years before this invention became commercially successful . An early use of one type of barcode in an industrial context was sponsored by the Association of American Railroads in the late 1960s . Developed by General Telephone and Electronics ( GTE ) and called KarTrak ACI ( Automatic Car Identification ) , this scheme involved placing colored stripes in various combinations on steel plates which were affixed to the sides of railroad rolling stock . Two plates were used per car , one on each side , with the arrangement of the colored stripes encoding information such as ownership , type of equipment , and identification number . The plates were read by a trackside scanner , located for instance , at the entrance to a classification yard , while the car was moving past .",
