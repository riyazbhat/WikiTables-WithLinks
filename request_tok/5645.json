Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in the United Kingdom . Born in Abobo , C\u00f4te dIvoire , left the country with her great-aunt Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Kouao , a French citizen who later abused her , for an education in France , where they travelled , before arriving in London in April 1999 . It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbi\u00e9 , although it is suspected to have worsened when Kouao and Climbi\u00e9 met and moved in with Carl Manning , who became Kouao 's boyfriend . During the abuse , Climbi\u00e9 was burnt with cigarettes , tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours , and hit with bike chains , hammers and wires . Up to her death , the police , the social services department of four local authorities , the National Health Service , the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) , and local churches all had contact with her , and noted the signs of abuse . However , in what the judge in the trial following Climbi\u00e9 's death described as blinding incompetence , all failed to properly investigate the case and little action was taken . Kouao and Manning were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment . After Climbi\u00e9 's death , the parties involved in her case were widely criticised . A public inquiry , headed by Lord Laming , was ordered . It discovered numerous instances where Climbi\u00e9 could have been saved , noted that many of the organisations involved in her care were badly run , and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case , as many of the participants were black . The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England .",

  "/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse": "Child sexual abuse , also called child molestation , is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation . Forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child ( whether by asking or pressuring , or by other means ) , indecent exposure ( of the genitals , female nipples , etc . ) , child grooming , child sexual exploitation or using a child to produce child pornography . Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings , including home , school , or work ( in places where child labor is common ) . Child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse ; UNICEF has stated that child marriage represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls . The effects of child sexual abuse can include depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , complex post-traumatic stress disorder , propensity to further victimization in adulthood , and physical injury to the child , among other problems . Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma , especially in the case of parental incest . The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7 % for females and 7.9 % for males . Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims ; approximately 30 % are relatives of the child , most often brothers , fathers , uncles , or cousins ; around 60 % are other acquaintances , such as friends of the family , babysitters , or neighbors ; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10 % of child sexual abuse cases . Most child sexual abuse is committed by men ; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14 % to 40 % of offenses reported against boys and 6 % of offenses reported against girls . The word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child , but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children . Under the law , child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification .",

Midlothian emerged as a county in the Middle Ages under larger boundaries than the modern council area , including Edinburgh itself - and also known as Edinburghshire until 1921 . It bordered West Lothian to the west , Lanarkshire , Peeblesshire and Selkirkshire to the south , and East Lothian , Berwickshire and Roxburghshire to the east . Traditional industries included mining , agriculture and fishing - although the modern council area is now landlocked . Under local government reforms in 1975 , Midlothian became a district council within the Lothian region and in 1996 the current unitary council area was created .

Daanish Zahid , Imran Shahid , Zeeshan Shahid and Mohammed Faisal Mustaq were later found guilty of racially motivated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment . The case , which featured the first-ever conviction for racially motivated murder in Scotland , is cited in two newspaper articles as an example of the lack of attention the media and society give to white sufferers of racist attacks compared to that given to ethnic minorities . It is also suggested the crime demonstrates how society has been forced to redefine racism so as to no longer exclude white victims .",

Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country 's West Central Lowlands . It is the fifth most visited city in the UK . Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",
  "/wiki/Death_of_Baby_P": "Peter Connelly ( also known as Baby P , Child A , and Baby Peter ) was a 17-month-old English boy who died in London in 2007 after suffering more than fifty injuries over an eight-month period , during which he was repeatedly seen by the London Borough of Haringey Children 's services and National Health Service ( NHS ) health professionals . Baby P 's real first name was revealed as Peter on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of Peter 's mother 's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old . His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009 . The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament , partly because of the magnitude of Peter 's injuries , and partly because Peter had lived in the London Borough of Haringey , North London , under the same child welfare authorities that had already failed seven years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 leading to a public inquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening . Peter 's mother Tracey Connelly , her boyfriend Steven Barker , and Jason Owen ( later revealed to be the brother of Barker ) were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child , the mother having pleaded guilty to the charge . A court order issued by the High Court in England had prevented the publication of the identity of Baby P ; this was lifted on 1 May 2009 by Justice Coleridge . An order sought by Haringey Council to stop publication of the identities of his mother and her boyfriend was granted , but expired on 10 August 2009 . The child protection services of Haringey and other agencies were widely criticised . Following the conviction , three inquiries and a nationwide review of social service care were launched , and the Head of Children 's Services at Haringey was removed at the direction of the government minister . Another nationwide review was conducted by Lord Laming into his own recommendations concerning Victoria Climbi\u00e9 's killing in 2000 . The death was also the subject of debate in the House of Commons .",

The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Between 1974 and 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was the administrative body covering the county ; this was abolished on 31 March 1986 , and the constituent metropolitan boroughs effectively became unitary authorities . A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands .

  "/wiki/London_Borough_of_Croydon": "The London Borough of Croydon ( pronunciation ( help\u00b7info ) ) is a London borough in South London , part of Outer London . It covers an area of 87 km2 ( 33.6 sq mi ) . It is the southernmost borough of London . At its centre is the historic town of Croydon from which the borough takes its name ; while other urban centres include Coulsdon , Purley , South Norwood , and Thornton Heath . Croydon is mentioned in Domesday Book , and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London . The borough is now one of London 's leading business , financial and cultural centres , and its influence in entertainment and the arts contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre . The borough was formed in 1965 from the merger of the County Borough of Croydon with Coulsdon and Purley Urban District , both of which had been within Surrey . The local authority , Croydon London Borough Council , is now part of London Councils , the local government association for Greater London . The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to Croydon Airport which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre . Once London 's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital , it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city . It is now a Grade II listed building and tourist attraction . Croydon Council and its predecessor Croydon Corporation unsuccessfully applied for city status in 1954 , 2000 , 2002 and 2012 .",

  "/wiki/Dismemberment": "Dismemberment refers , in general terms , to the act of cutting , tearing , pulling , wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing . It has been practiced upon human beings as a form of capital punishment , especially in connection with regicide , but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident , or in connection with murder , suicide , or cannibalism . As opposed to surgical amputation of the limbs , dismemberment is often fatal to all but the simplest of creatures . In criminology , a distinction is made between offensive dismemberment , in which dismemberment is the primary objective of the dismemberer , and defensive dismemberment , in which the motivation is to destroy evidence . In 2019 , Michael H. Stone , Gary Brucato and Ann Burgess proposed formal criteria by which dismemberment might be systematically distinguished from the act of mutilation , as these terms are commonly used interchangeably . They suggested that dismemberment involves the entire removal , by any means , of a large section of the body of a living or dead person , specifically , the head ( also termed decapitation ) , arms , hands , torso , pelvic area , legs , or feet . Mutilation , by contrast , involves the removal or irreparable disfigurement , by any means , of some smaller portion of one of those larger sections of a living or dead person . The latter would include castration ( removal of the testes ) , evisceration ( removal of the internal organs ) , and flaying ( removal of the skin ) . According to these parameters , removing a whole hand would constitute dismemberment , while removing or damaging a finger would be mutilation ; decapitation of a full head would be dismemberment , while removing or damaging a part of the face would be mutilation ; and removing a whole torso would be dismemberment , while removing or damaging a breast or the organs contained within the torso would be mutilation ."
