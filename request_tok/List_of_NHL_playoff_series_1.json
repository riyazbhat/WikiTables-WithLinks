  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings": "The Los Angeles Kings are a professional ice hockey team based in Los Angeles . They compete in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference . The team was founded on June 5 , 1967 , after Jack Kent Cooke was awarded an NHL expansion franchise for Los Angeles on February 9 , 1966 , becoming one of the six teams that began play as part of the 1967 NHL expansion . The Kings played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood , California , a suburb of Los Angeles , for thirty-two years , until they moved to the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles at the start of the 1999-2000 season . During the 1970s and early 1980s , the Kings had many years marked by impressive play in the regular season only to be washed out by early playoff exits . Their highlights in those years included the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon , and the Triple Crown Line of Charlie Simmer , Dave Taylor and Hall of Fame player Marcel Dionne , who had a famous upset of the uprising Edmonton Oilers in a 1982 playoff game known as the Miracle on Manchester . In 1988 , the Kings traded with the Oilers to get their captain Wayne Gretzky , leading to a successful phase of the franchise that raised hockey 's popularity in Los Angeles , and helped raise the sport 's profile in the American Sun Belt region . Gretzky , fellow Hall of Famer Luc Robitaille and defenseman Rob Blake led the Kings to the franchise 's sole division title in 1990-91 , and the Kings ' first Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1993 . After the 1993 Finals , the Kings entered financial problems , with a bankruptcy in 1995 , which led to the franchise being acquired by Philip Anschutz ( owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group , operators of Staples Center ) and Edward P. Roski . A period of mediocrity ensued , with the Kings only resurging as they broke a six-year playoff drought in the 2009-10 season , with a team that included goaltender Jonathan Quick , defenseman Drew Doughty , and forwards Dustin Brown , Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams . Under coach Darryl Sutter , who was hired early in the 2011-12 season , the Kings won two Stanley Cups in three years : 2012 , over the New Jersey Devils , and 2014 , against the New York Rangers while Quick and Williams respectively won the Conn Smythe Trophy .",
