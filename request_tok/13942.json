Rosbaud 's first professional post was in Mainz , starting in 1921 , as the music director of the city 's new School of Music , which included conducting the municipal symphony concerts . He became the first chief conductor of the Hessicher Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra ( later the Hr-Sinfonieorchester ) of Frankfurt in 1928 . During the 1920s and 1930s , he presented premieres of works by Arnold Schoenberg and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k . During the Nazi era , his freedom to present new music was restricted .

He was also closely associated with the Liverpool Philharmonic and Hall\u00e9 orchestras . From the early 20th century until his death , Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of Britain and , according to the BBC , was Britain 's first international conductor . Born to a rich industrial family , Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899 . He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War , staging seasons at Covent Garden , Drury Lane and His Majesty 's Theatre with international stars , his own orchestra and a wide repertoire . Among the works he introduced to England were Richard Strauss 's Elektra , Salome and Der Rosenkavalier and three operas by Frederick Delius . Together with his younger colleague Malcolm Sargent , Beecham founded the London Philharmonic , and he conducted its first performance at the Queen 's Hall in 1932 . In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the Seattle Symphony and conducted at the Metropolitan Opera . After his return to Britain , he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961 . Beecham 's repertoire was eclectic , sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones . His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate , such as Delius and Berlioz . Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were Haydn , Schubert , Sibelius and the composer he revered above all others , Mozart .",
  "/wiki/BBC_Symphony_Orchestra": "The BBC Symphony Orchestra ( BBC SO ) is a British orchestra based in London . Founded in 1930 , it was the first permanent salaried orchestra in London , and is the only one of the city 's five major symphony orchestras not to be self-governing . The BBC SO is the principal broadcast orchestra of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . The orchestra was originally conceived in 1928 as a joint enterprise by the BBC and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham , but the latter withdrew the next year ; and the task of assembling and training the orchestra fell to the BBC 's director of music , Adrian Boult . Among its guest conductors in its first years was Arturo Toscanini , who judged it the finest orchestra he had ever conducted . During and after the Second World War , Boult strove to maintain standards , but the senior management of the post-war BBC did not allocate the orchestra the resources to meet competition from new and well-funded rivals . After Boult 's retirement from the BBC in 1950 , the orchestra went through a fallow period . Boult 's successor , Sir Malcolm Sargent , was popular with the public but had poor rapport with his players , and orchestral morale dropped . Sargent 's successor , Rudolf Schwarz , made little public impact , and although the BBC appointed high-profile chief conductors in the 1960s and 1970s - Antal Dor\u00e1ti , Colin Davis , Pierre Boulez and Gennady Rozhdestvensky - the BBC SO remained underfunded and could not attract enough good players to rival the leading London orchestras . As a result of initiatives begun in the 1960s by the BBC controller of music William Glock , performing standards gradually began to rise . Under Andrew Davis in the 1990s and Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek in the 2000s the orchestra prospered . By the second decade of the 21st century the BBC SO was once again regarded by critics as of first-class status .",

The first incarnation of the orchestra occurred in 1946 , initially with members of the discontinued spa orchestra of the city as the core of players . The revival of the spa orchestra two years later forced the reorganization of the radio orchestra . Subsequently , Hans Rosbaud was hired as the orchestra 's first chief conductor . Rosbaud was already well known as a champion of modern music , and Heinrich Strobel , the music director in charge of the orchestra , shared this sympathy with contemporary music . Thus the orchestra had as its focus performances of modern music . The orchestra was first sponsored by S\u00fcdwestfunk ( SWF ) , a public broadcasting corporation headquartered in Baden-Baden . In 1998 SWF merged into S\u00fcdwestrundfunk ( Southwest Broadcasting ) , which took over responsibility for the orchestra .
