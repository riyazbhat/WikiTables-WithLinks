  "/wiki/Computer_scientist": "A computer scientist is a person who has acquired the knowledge of computer science , the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application . Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems , as opposed to the hardware side on which computer engineers mainly focus ( although there is overlap ) . Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas ( such as algorithm and data structure development and design , software engineering , information theory , database theory , computational complexity theory , numerical analysis , programming language theory , computer graphics , and computer vision ) , their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive . A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models , often mathematical , to describe the properties of computer-based systems ( processors , programs , computers interacting with people , computers interacting with other computers , etc . ) with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits ( faster , smaller , cheaper , more precise , etc . ) .",
  "/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize": "The Gordon Bell Prize is an award presented by the Association for Computing Machinery each year in conjunction with the SC Conference series ( formerly known as the Supercomputing Conference ) . The prize recognizes outstanding achievement in high-performance computing applications . The main purpose is to track the progress over time of parallel computing , by acknowledging and rewarding innovation in applying high-performance computing to applications in science , engineering , and large-scale data analytics . The prize was established in 1987 . A cash award of $ 10,000 ( since 2011 ) accompanies the recognition , funded by Gordon Bell , a pioneer in high-performance and parallel computing . The Prizes were preceded by a nominal prize ( $ 100 ) established by Alan Karp , a numerical analyst ( then of IBM ) who challenged claims of MIMD performance improvements proposed in the Letters to the Editor section of the Communications of the ACM . Karp went on to be one of the first Gordon Bell Prize judges . Individuals or teams may apply for the award by submitting a technical paper describing their work through the SC conference submissions process . Finalists present their work at that year 's conference , and their submissions are included in the conference proceedings .",
  "/wiki/IEEE": "The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) is a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering ( and associated disciplines ) with its corporate office in New York City and its operations center in Piscataway , New Jersey .

  "/wiki/Connection_Machine": "A Connection Machine ( CM ) is a member of a series of massively parallel supercomputers that grew out of doctoral research on alternatives to the traditional von Neumann architecture of computers by Danny Hillis at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the early 1980s . Starting with CM-1 , the machines were intended originally for applications in artificial intelligence ( AI ) and symbolic processing , but later versions found greater success in the field of computational science .",
  "/wiki/Supercomputer": "A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer . The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second ( FLOPS ) instead of million instructions per second ( MIPS ) . Since 2017 , there are supercomputers which can perform over a hundred quadrillion FLOPS ( petaFLOPS ) . Since November 2017 , all of the world 's fastest 500 supercomputers run Linux-based operating systems . Additional research is being conducted in China , the United States , the European Union , Taiwan and Japan to build faster , more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers . Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science , and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields , including quantum mechanics , weather forecasting , climate research , oil and gas exploration , molecular modeling ( computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds , biological macromolecules , polymers , and crystals ) , and physical simulations ( such as simulations of the early moments of the universe , airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics , the detonation of nuclear weapons , and nuclear fusion ) . They have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis . Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s , and for several decades the fastest were made by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation ( CDC ) , Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram . The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran faster than their more general-purpose contemporaries . Through the decade , increasing amounts of parallelism were added , with one to four processors being typical . From the 1970s , vector processors operating on large arrays of data came to dominate . A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976 .",

  "/wiki/John_Ogbu": "John Uzo Ogbu ( May 9 , 1939 - August 20 , 2003 ) was a Nigerian-American anthropologist and professor known for his theories on observed phenomena involving race and intelligence , especially how race and ethnic differences played out in educational and economic achievement . He suggested that being a caste-like minority affects motivation and achievement , depressing IQ scores . He also concluded that some students did poorly because high achievement was considered acting white among their peers . Ogbu was also involved in the 1996 controversy surrounding the use of African American Vernacular English in public schools in Oakland , California . The 2000 book Eminent Educators : Studies in Intellectual Influence focused on him as one of four intellectual giants of the 20th century .",

  "/wiki/Biafran": "Biafra , officially the Republic of Biafra , was a state in West Africa that existed from May 1967 to January 1970 . It was made up of the states in the Eastern Region of Nigeria . Biafra 's declaration of independence from Nigeria resulted in civil war between Biafra and Nigeria . Biafra was formally recognised by Gabon , Haiti , Ivory Coast , Tanzania and Zambia . Other nations , which did not give official recognition but provided support and assistance to Biafra , included Israel , France , Spain , Portugal , Norway , Rhodesia , South Africa and Vatican City.A Biafra received aid from non-state actors , including Joint Church Aid , Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland , and under their direction Caritas International , and U.S. Catholic Relief Services . M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res ( Doctors Without Borders ) also originated in response to the suffering . Its inhabitants were mostly Igbo , who led the independence movement due to economic , ethnic , cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria . Other ethnic groups included the Efik , Ibibio , Annang , Ejagham , Eket , Ibeno and the Ijaw . After two-and-a-half years of war , during which almost two million Biafran civilians died from starvation caused by the total blockade of the region by the Nigerian and British governments , Biafran forces under Nigeria 's motto of No-victor , No-vanquished surrendered to the Nigerian Federal Military Government ( FMG ) . The surrender was facilitated by the Biafran Vice President and Chief of General Staff , Major General Philip Effiong , who assumed leadership of the Republic of Biafra after the original President , Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu , fled to Ivory Coast . After the surrender of Biafra , some Igbos who had fled the conflict returned to their properties but were unable to claim them back from new occupants . This became law in the Abandoned Properties Act ( 28 September 1979 ) ."
