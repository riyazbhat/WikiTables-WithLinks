  "/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_&_Museum": "The National September 11 Memorial & Museum ( also known as the 9/11 Memorial & Museum ) is a memorial and museum in New York City commemorating the September 11 , 2001 attacks , which killed 2,977 people , and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , which killed six . The memorial is located at the World Trade Center site , the former location of the Twin Towers that were destroyed during the September 11 attacks . It is operated by a non-profit institution whose mission is to raise funds for , program , and operate the memorial and museum at the World Trade Center site . A memorial was planned in the immediate aftermath of the attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center for the victims and those involved in rescue and recovery operations . The winner of the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was Israeli-American architect Michael Arad of Handel Architects , a New York- and San Francisco-based firm . Arad worked with landscape-architecture firm Peter Walker and Partners on the design , creating a forest of swamp white oak trees with two square reflecting pools in the center marking where the Twin Towers stood . In August 2006 , the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began heavy construction on the memorial and museum . The design is consistent with the original master plan by Daniel Libeskind , which called for the memorial to be 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) below street level - originally 70 feet ( 21 m ) - in a plaza , and was the only finalist to disregard Libeskind 's requirement that the buildings overhang the footprints of the Twin Towers . The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was renamed the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in 2007 . A dedication ceremony commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attacks was held at the memorial on September 11 , 2011 , and it opened to the public the following day . The museum was dedicated on May 15 , 2014 , with remarks from Michael Bloomberg and President Barack Obama . The museum opened to the public on May 21 .",
