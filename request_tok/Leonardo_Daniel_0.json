  "/wiki/Mundo_de_juguete": "Mundo de juguete ( English : Toy World ) is a Mexican telenovela produced by Televisa . It is a remake of 1973 Argentine telenovela telenovela Pap\u00e1 coraz\u00f3n . It premiered on November 4 , 1974 on Canal de las Estrellas and ended on February 25 , 1977 . This telenovela holds the record for having the second longest run ever for a Latin American telenovela , with a total of 605 episodes ( 1974-1977 ) . Most telenovelas run for an average of six to eight months ; the shortest ones run about four months , and the longest up to a year . Many Mundo de Juguete fans believe that either all or some of the tapes and film from the telenovela were lost when Televisa collapsed during the 1985 earthquake . Televisa has been secretive regarding which tapes were lost during that earthquake , so there is no way of confirming this . However , such claims can be disputed , considering that the Telenovela has been repeated on television several times after 1985 . During the nineties , it was repeated on Mexico City Canal 9 ( now Galavision ) . For a period of time , it was also shown on Unicable ( a Televisa Networks cable channel ) or on Telenovelas ( a channel also belonging to Televisa Networks specializing on reruns of old telenovelas ) Televisa remade the telenovela in 2000 , and called it Carita de \u00e1ngel .",
