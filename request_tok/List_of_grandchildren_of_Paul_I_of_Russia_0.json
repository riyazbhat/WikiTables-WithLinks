After an assassination attempt in 1866 , Alexander adopted a somewhat more reactionary stance until his death . Alexander pivoted towards foreign policy and sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 , fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there were another war . He sought peace , moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871 , and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation . Despite his otherwise pacifist foreign policy , he fought a brief war with the Ottoman Empire in 1877-78 , pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus , and conquered Turkestan . Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , Alexander abided by that agreement .
