  "/wiki/Stainless_steel": "In metallurgy , stainless steel , also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable ( inoxidizable ) , is a steel alloy , with a minimum of 11% chromium content by mass and a maximum of 1.2% carbon by mass . Stainless steels are most notable for their corrosion resistance , which increases with increasing chromium content . Additions of molybdenum increases corrosion resistance in reducing acids and against pitting attack in chloride solutions . Thus , there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure . Resistance to corrosion and staining , low maintenance , and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required . Stainless steel is rolled into sheets , plates , bars , wire , and tubing to be used in : cookware , cutlery , surgical instruments , major appliances ; construction material in large buildings , such as the Chrysler Building ; industrial equipment ( for example , in paper mills , chemical plants , water treatment ) ; and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products ( for example , chemical tankers and road tankers ) . Corrosion resistance , the ease with which it can be steam cleaned and sterilized , and lack of need for surface coatings has also influenced the use of stainless steel in commercial kitchens and food processing plants .",

  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",

  "/wiki/Robin_Hood": "Robin Hood is a legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore and subsequently featured in literature and film . According to legend , he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman . In some versions of the legend , he is depicted as being of noble birth , and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff . In the oldest known versions he is instead a member of the yeoman class . Traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green , he is said to have robbed from the rich and given to the poor . Through retellings , additions , and variations , a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created . These include his lover , Maid Marian , his band of outlaws , the Merry Men , and his chief opponent , the Sheriff of Nottingham . The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard , to whom Robin Hood remains loyal . His partisanship of the common people and his hostility to the Sheriff of Nottingham are early recorded features of the legend , but his interest in the rightfulness of the king is not , and neither is his setting in the reign of Richard I . He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages , and the earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century ( 1400s ) . There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years , and the story continues to be widely represented in literature , film , and television . Robin Hood is considered one of the best known tales of English folklore .",

  "/wiki/Stone": "A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter . It is categorized by the minerals included , its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed . Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups : igneous rocks , metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks . Rocks form the Earth 's outer solid layer , the crust . Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth 's crust , or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed . The metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such large pressures and temperatures that they are transformed - something that occurs , for example , when continental plates collide . The sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis or lithification of sediments , which in turn are formed by the weathering , transport , and deposition of existing rocks . The scientific study of rocks is called petrology , which is an essential component of geology .",
