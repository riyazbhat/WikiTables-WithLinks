The first Hertford College began in the 1280s as Hart Hall and became a college in 1740 but was dissolved in 1816 . In 1820 , the site was taken over by Magdalen Hall , which had emerged around 1490 on a site adjacent to Magdalen College . In 1874 , Magdalen Hall was incorporated as a college , reviving the name Hertford College . In 1974 , Hertford was part of the first group of all-male Oxford colleges to admit women .

  "/wiki/William_Bedwell": "William Bedwell ( 1561 - 5 May 1632 near London ) was an English priest and scholar , specializing in Arabic and other oriental languages as well as in mathematics . Bedwell was educated at St John 's College , Cambridge . He served the Anglican Church as Rector of St Ethelburga 's Bishopsgate and Vicar of All Hallows , Tottenham ( known at the time as Tottenham High Cross ) from 1607 . He was the author of the first local history of the area , A Briefe Description of the Towne of Tottenham . He published in quarto an edition of the Epistles of John in Arabic , with a Latin version , printed by the Raphelengius family at Antwerp in 1612 . He also left many Arabic manuscripts to the University of Cambridge and a font of type for printing them . According to McClure , it was Bedwell , and not Thomas Van Erpen , who was the first to revive the study of Arabic literature in Europe . His uncompleted preparations for an Arabic Lexicon were eclipsed by the publication of a similar work by Jacobus Golius in 1653 . He asserted that knowledge of Arabic was necessary to a deeper understanding of ancient Hebrew . Bedwell 's manuscripts were loaned , following his death , to the University of Cambridge , where they were consulted by Edmund Castell during the creation of the monumental Lexicon Heptaglotton ( 1669 ) . Another manuscript , for a Dictionary of Persian , was in the possession of William Laud , Archbishop of Canterbury , and now resides at the Bodleian Library . Besides his Arabic Epistles of John , his most well-known published work was A Discovery of the Impostures of Mahomet and of the Koran , ( 1615 ) .",

Elizabeth I of England approved its initial charter on 11 September 1581 when the Venice Company ( 1583 ) and the Turkey Company ( 1581 ) merged , because their charters had expired , as she was anxious to maintain trade and political alliances with the Ottoman Empire . Its initial charter was good for seven years and was granted to Edward Osborne , Richard Staper , Thomas Smith and William Garret with the purpose of regulating English trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Levant .

With an official population of 4.6 million in 2010 , Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War ; however , it is now the second-largest city in Syria , after the capital Damascus . [ citation needed ] Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world ; it may have been inhabited since the 6th millennium BC . Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari , just south of the old city of Aleppo , show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the 3rd millennium BC . That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia , which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad , and note its commercial and military proficiency . Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center midway between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia . For centuries , Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region , and the Ottoman Empire 's third-largest after Constantinople and Cairo . The city 's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road , which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia . When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869 , much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline . At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I , Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey , as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul . In the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea , Antakya and \u0130skenderun , likewise to Turkey . Finally , the isolation of Syria in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation .",

The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires , including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC . Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world . In the Islamic era , Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt . The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman and a brief period French mandate , and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces . It gained de jure independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945 , when Republic of Syria became a founding member of the United Nations , an act which legally ended the former French Mandate - although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946 .",

Arrested in 1640 , he was executed in 1645 . In matters of church polity , Laud was autocratic . Laudianism refers to a collection of rules on matters of ritual , in particular , that were enforced by Laud in order to maintain uniform worship in England and Wales , in line with the king 's preferences . They were precursors to later High Church views . In theology , Laud was accused of being an Arminian and opponent of Calvinism , as well as covertly favouring Roman Catholic doctrines ( see Arminianism in the Church of England ) . On all three grounds , he was regarded by Puritan clerics and laymen as a formidable and dangerous opponent . Laud favoured scholars , and was a major collector of manuscripts .

  "/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England": "The Commonwealth was the political structure during the period from 1649 to 1660 when England and Wales , later along with Ireland and Scotland , were governed as a republic after the end of the Second English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I . The republic 's existence was declared through An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth , adopted by the Rump Parliament on 19 May 1649 . Power in the early Commonwealth was vested primarily in the Parliament and a Council of State . During the period , fighting continued , particularly in Ireland and Scotland , between the parliamentary forces and those opposed to them , as part of what is now referred to as the Third English Civil War . In 1653 , after dissolution of the Rump Parliament , the Army Council adopted the Instrument of Government which made Oliver Cromwell Lord Protector of a united Commonwealth of England , Scotland and Ireland , inaugurating the period now usually known as the Protectorate . After Cromwell 's death , and following a brief period of rule under his son , Richard Cromwell , the Protectorate Parliament was dissolved in 1659 and the Rump Parliament recalled , starting a process that led to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 . The term Commonwealth is sometimes used for the whole of 1649 to 1660 - called by some the Interregnum - although for other historians , the use of the term is limited to the years prior to Cromwell 's formal assumption of power in 1653 . In retrospect , the period of republican rule for England was a failure in the short term . During the 11-year period , no stable government was established to rule the English state for longer than a few months at a time . Several administrative structures were tried , and several Parliaments called and seated , but little in the way of meaningful , lasting legislation was passed . The only force keeping it together was the personality of Oliver Cromwell , who exerted control through the military by way of the Grandees , being the Major-Generals and other senior military leaders of the New Model Army . Not only did Cromwell 's regime crumble into near anarchy upon his death and the brief administration of his son , but the monarchy he overthrew was restored in 1660 , and its first act was officially to erase all traces of any constitutional reforms of the Republican period .",

However , the King 's plans for the college were disrupted by the Wars of the Roses and resultant scarcity of funds , and his eventual deposition .

The current archbishop is Justin Welby , who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013 . Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission .",

Having first appeared in the early first century CE in Edessa , classical Syriac became a major literary language throughout the Middle East from the 4th to the 8th centuries , preserved in a large body of Syriac literature . Indeed , Syriac literature comprises roughly 90% of the extant Aramaic literature . Syriac was once spoken across much of the Near East as well as Anatolia and Eastern Arabia . Syriac originated in Mesopotamia and eventually spread west of Iraq in which it became the lingua franca of the region during the Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian period . The Old Aramaic language was adopted by the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( 911-609 BC ) when the Assyrians conquered the various Syro-Hittite states to its west . The Achaemenid Empire ( 546-332 BC ) , which rose after the fall of the Assyrian Empire , also retained Old Aramaic as its official language , and Old Aramaic remained the lingua franca of the region . During the course of the third and fourth centuries AD , the inhabitants of the region began to embrace Christianity . Because of theological differences , Syriac-speaking Christians bifurcated during the 5th century into the Church of the East , or East Syrians under Sasanian rule , and the Syriac Orthodox , or West Syrians under the Byzantine empire . After this separation , the two groups developed distinct dialects differing primarily in the pronunciation and written symbolisation of vowels . The modern , and vastly spoken , Syriac varieties today include Assyrian Neo-Aramaic , Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and Turoyo , among others , which , in turn , have their own subdialects as well . Along with Latin and Greek , Syriac became one of the three most important Christian languages in the early centuries of the Common Era .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet .

It is a pluricentric language predominantly spoken and used officially within Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan in three mutually intelligible standard varieties , namely Iranian Persian , Dari Persian ( officially named Dari since 1958 ) and Tajiki Persian ( officially named Tajik since the Soviet era ) . It is also spoken natively in the Tajik variety by a significant population within Uzbekistan , as well as within other regions with a Persianate history in the cultural sphere of Greater Iran . It is written officially within Iran and Afghanistan in the Persian alphabet , a derivation of the Arabic script , and within Tajikistan in the Tajik alphabet , a derivation of Cyrillic . The Persian language is a continuation of Middle Persian , the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-651 CE ) , itself a continuation of Old Persian , which was used in the Achaemenid Empire ( 550-330 BC ) . It originated in the region of Fars ( Persia ) in southwestern Iran . Its grammar is similar to that of many European languages . Throughout history , Persian has been a prestigious cultural language used by various empires in Western Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . Old Persian written works are attested in Old Persian cuneiform on several inscriptions from between the 6th and the 4th centuries BC , and Middle Persian literature is attested in Aramaic-derived scripts ( Pahlavi and Manichaean ) on inscriptions from the time of the Parthian Empire and in books centered in Zoroastrian and Manichaean scriptures from between the 3rd to the 10th century AD . New Persian literature began to flourish after the Arab conquest of Iran with its earliest records from the 9th century , since then adopting the Arabic script . Persian was the first language to break through the monopoly of Arabic on writing in the Muslim world , with the writing of Persian poetry developed as a court tradition in many eastern courts . Some of the famous works of medieval Persian literature are the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi , the works of Rumi , the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , the Panj Ganj of Nizami Ganjavi , the Div\u0101n of Hafez , The Conference of the Birds by Attar of Nishapur , and the miscellanea of Gulistan and Bustan by Saadi Shirazi .",
