  "/wiki/Display_resolution": "The display resolution or display modes of a digital television , computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed . It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays , flat-panel displays ( including liquid-crystal displays ) and projection displays using fixed picture-element ( pixel ) arrays . It is usually quoted as width \u00d7 height , with the units in pixels : for example , 1024 \u00d7 768 means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels . This example would normally be spoken as ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight or ten twenty-four by seven six eight . One use of the term display resolution applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as plasma display panels ( PDP ) , liquid-crystal displays ( LCD ) , Digital Light Processing ( DLP ) projectors , OLED displays , and similar technologies , and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display ( e.g . 1920 \u00d7 1080 ) . A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that , for multi-format video inputs , all displays need a scaling engine ( a digital video processor that includes a memory array ) to match the incoming picture format to the display . For device displays such as phones , tablets , monitors and televisions , the use of the term display resolution as defined above is a misnomer , though common . The term display resolution is usually used to mean pixel dimensions , the maximum number of pixels in each dimension ( e.g . 1920 \u00d7 1080 ) , which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed : resolution properly refers to the pixel density , the number of pixels per unit distance or area , not the total number of pixels . In digital measurement , the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch ( PPI ) . In analog measurement , if the screen is 10 inches high , then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10 inches wide",
  "/wiki/Color_depth": "Color depth or colour depth ( see spelling differences ) , also known as bit depth , is either the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel , in a bitmapped image or video framebuffer , or the number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel . For consumer video standards , such as High Efficiency Video Coding ( H.265 ) , the bit depth specifies the number of bits used for each color component . When referring to a pixel , the concept can be defined as bits per pixel ( bpp ) , which specifies the number of bits used . When referring to a color component , the concept can be defined as bits per component , bits per channel , bits per color ( all three abbreviated bpc ) , and also bits per pixel component , bits per color channel or bits per sample ( bps ) . Color depth is only one aspect of color representation , expressing the precision with which colors can be expressed ; the other aspect is how broad a range of colors can be expressed ( the gamut ) . The definition of both color precision and gamut is accomplished with a color encoding specification which assigns a digital code value to a location in a color space",
  "/wiki/Game_controller": "A game controller , or simply controller , is an input device used with video games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game , typically to control an object or character in the game . Before the seventh generation of video game consoles , plugging in a controller into one of a console 's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller , although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers , which do not require controller ports on the console but are battery-powered . USB game controllers could also be connected to a computer with a USB port . Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards , mouses , gamepads , joysticks , etc . Special purpose devices , such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games , are also game controllers . Game controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible . The Microsoft Xbox controller , with its shoulder triggers that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns , has become popular for shooting games . Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game , such as steering wheels for driving games , or dance pads for dancing games . One of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button , used to control the game Tennis for Two . Controllers have since evolved to include directional pads , multiple buttons , analog sticks , joysticks , motion detection , touch screens and a plethora of other features",

  "/wiki/D-pad": "A D-pad ( short for digital pad or directional pad ; also known as a control pad ) is a flat , usually thumb-operated , usually digital , four-way directional control with one button on each point , found on nearly all modern video game console gamepads , game controllers , on the remote control units of some television and DVD players , and smart phones . Like early video game joysticks , the vast majority of D-pads are digital ; in other words , only the directions provided on the D-pad buttons can be used , with no intermediate values . However , combinations of two directions ( up and left , for example ) do provide diagonals and many modern D-pads can be used to provide eight-directional input if appropriate . Although digital pads offer less flexibility than analog sticks , they can easily be manipulated ( requiring little movement of the thumb ) with very high accuracy . They are also far less demanding in maintenance and do not protrude very far from the controller , making them ideal for portable consoles such as the Game Boy , Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable . D-pads have appeared on other kinds of electronic equipment , including A/V remote controls ( especially since the appearance of DVD players , which are heavily menu driven ) , calculators , PDAs , smartphones , and car stereos such as the AutoPC",

  "/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display": "A liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers . Liquid crystals do not emit light directly , instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome . LCDs are available to display arbitrary images ( as in a general-purpose computer display ) or fixed images with low information content , which can be displayed or hidden , such as preset words , digits , and seven-segment displays , as in a digital clock . They use the same basic technology , except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels , while other displays have larger elements . LCDs can either be normally on ( positive ) or off ( negative ) , depending on the polarizer arrangement . For example , a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight , and a character negative LCD will have a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight . Optical filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance . LCDs are used in a wide range of applications , including LCD televisions , computer monitors , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and indoor and outdoor signage . Small LCD screens are common in portable consumer devices such as digital cameras , watches , calculators , and mobile telephones , including smartphones . LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics products such as DVD players , video game devices and clocks . LCD screens have replaced heavy , bulky cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays in nearly all applications . LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays , with LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to very large television receivers",
  "/wiki/ROM_cartridge": "A ROM cartridge , usually referred to simply as a cartridge or cart , is a removable memory card containing ROM designed to be connected to a consumer electronics device such as a home computer , video game console or , to a lesser extent , electronic musical instruments . ROM cartridges can be used to load software such as video games or other application programs . The cartridge slot could also be used for hardware additions , for example speech synthesis . Some cartridges had battery-backed static random-access memory , allowing a user to save data such as game progress or scores between uses . ROM cartridges allowed the user to rapidly load and access programs and data without the expense of a floppy drive , which was an expensive peripheral during the home computer era , and without using slow , sequential , and often unreliable Compact Cassette tape . An advantage for the manufacturer was the relative security of the software in cartridge form , which was difficult for end users to replicate . However , cartridges were expensive to manufacture compared to making a floppy disk or CD-ROM . As disk drives became more common and software expanded beyond the practical limits of ROM size , cartridge slots disappeared from later game consoles and personal computers . Cartridges are still used today with handheld gaming consoles such as the Nintendo DS , Nintendo 3DS , PlayStation Vita , and the tablet-like hybrid console Nintendo Switch . Due to its widespread usage for video gaming , a ROM cartridge is often colloquially referred to as a game cartridge",
  "/wiki/Gizmondo": "The Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console developed by Tiger Telematics . It was released in the UK , Sweden and the U.S. starting in March 2005 . Its first-party games were developed in studios in Helsingborg , Sweden , and Manchester , England . Gizmondo Europe , Ltd. was based in London , England , and was a subsidiary of Florida-based Tiger Telematics , whose chairman Carl Freer led Gizmondo 's development . Before its launch the Gizmondo had high expectations by some journalists due to its extensive feature set , and it was aimed to compete against Nintendo and Sony ; however , it ended up as a major sales failure . The company extravagantly spent millions on promotions such as a celebrity party at London 's Park Lane Hotel , and taking part at the 24 Hours of Le Mans , despite never making a profit . Its American debut was delayed several times , and a widescreen version was announced shortly before its release - resulting in low sales . With fewer than 25,000 units sold , the Gizmondo was named by GamePro as the worst selling handheld console in history . The Gizmondo was further overshadowed when Swedish press revealed criminal pasts of several executives , causing their resignations including Tiger Telematics CEO Carl Freer . Director of Gizmondo Europe Stefan Eriksson was involved in a Swedish criminal organisation , the Uppsalamaffian ( the Uppsala mafia ) . By February 2006 , the company was forced into bankruptcy after amassing US $ 300 million debt , and the Gizmondo stopped production .

As a seventh generation console , the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS . Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003 , and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11 , 2004 . The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced , and was the first real competitor of Nintendo 's handheld consoles after many challengers , such as SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia 's N-Gage , had failed . The PSP 's advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device , which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles , computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software , other PSP systems , and the Internet . The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format - Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) - as its primary storage medium . The PSP was received positively by critics , and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime . Several models of the console were released , before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita , released in Japan in 2011 and worldwide a year later . The Vita has backward compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store , which became the main method of purchasing PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31 , 2016 .

  "/wiki/Touchscreen": "A touchscreen , or touch screen , is a both input and output device and normally layered on the top of an electronic visual display of an information processing system . A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or multi-touch gestures by touching the screen with a special stylus or one or more fingers . Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others may only work using a special stylus or pen . The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and , if the software allows , to control how it is displayed ; for example , zooming to increase the text size . The touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed , rather than using a mouse , touchpad , or other such devices ( other than a stylus , which is optional for most modern touchscreens ) . Touchscreens are common in devices such as game consoles , personal computers , electronic voting machines , and point-of-sale ( POS ) systems . They can also be attached to computers or , as terminals , to networks . They play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) and some e-readers . Touchscreens are also important in educational settings such as classrooms or on college campuses . The popularity of smartphones , tablets , and many types of information appliances is driving the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics . Touchscreens are found in the medical field , heavy industry , automated teller machines ( ATMs ) , and kiosks such as museum displays or room automation , where keyboard and mouse systems do not allow a suitably intuitive , rapid , or accurate interaction by the user with the display 's content . Historically , the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based firmware have been made available by a wide array of after-market system integrators , and not by display , chip , or motherboard manufacturers",

Later improvements took advantage of quality upgrades to the handheld 's screen and added color . The WonderSwan is playable both vertically and horizontally , and features a unique library of games , including numerous first-party titles based on licensed anime properties , as well as significant third-party support from developers such as Squaresoft , Namco , Capcom and Banpresto . Overall , the WonderSwan in all its variations combined to sell an estimated 3.5 million units and managed to obtain as much as 8 % of the Japanese handheld video game console market before being marginalized by Nintendo 's Game Boy Advance . Retrospective feedback praises the potential of the WonderSwan despite its low sales and its brief time holding its own against Nintendo in the marketplace"
