  "/wiki/The_Seekers": "The Seekers are an Australian folk-influenced pop quartet , originally formed in Melbourne in 1962 . They were the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States . They were popular during the 1960s with their best-known configuration as : Judith Durham on vocals , piano , and tambourine ; Athol Guy on double bass and vocals ; Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar , banjo , and vocals ; and Bruce Woodley on guitar , mandolin , banjo , and vocals . The group had Top 10 hits in the 1960s with I 'll Never Find Another You , A World of Our Own , Morningtown Ride , Someday , One Day ( written by Paul Simon ) , Georgy Girl ( the title song of the film of the same name ) , and The Carnival Is Over by Tom Springfield , the last being an adaptation of the Russian folk song Stenka Razin . It is still one of the top 50 best-selling singles in the UK . Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as concentrated on a bright , uptempo sound , although they were too pop to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock . In 1967 , they were named as joint Australians of the Year - the only group thus honoured . In July 1968 , Durham left to pursue a solo career and the group disbanded . The band has reformed periodically , and in 1995 they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame . I 'll Never Find Another You was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia 's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011 . Woodley 's and Dobe Newton 's song I Am Australian , which was recorded by The Seekers , and by Durham with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu , has become an unofficial Australian anthem . With I 'll Never Find Another You and Georgy Girl , the band also achieved success in the United States , but not nearly at the same level as in the rest of the world .",

Cash was known for his deep , calm bass-baritone voice , [ a ] the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms , a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor , free prison concerts , and a trademark , all-black stage wardrobe , which earned him the nickname The Man in Black . [ b ] He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself , Hello , I 'm Johnny Cash , [ c ] followed by his signature song Folsom Prison Blues . Much of Cash 's music contained themes of sorrow , moral tribulation , and redemption , especially in the later stages of his career .
