Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January 14 , 1895 , in which voters favored incorporation by a 46-7 margin . To address the concerns of Englewood Township 's leaders , the new municipality was formed as a township , rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time .
