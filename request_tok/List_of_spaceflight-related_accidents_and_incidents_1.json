  "/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center": "The John F. Kennedy Space Center ( KSC , originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center ) , located in Merritt Island , Florida , is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers . Since December 1968 , KSC has been NASA 's primary launch center of human spaceflight . Launch operations for the Apollo , Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC . Located on the east coast of Florida , KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ( CCAFS ) . The management of the two entities work very closely together , share resources , and even own facilities on each other 's property . Though the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from CCAFS , the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization , the Launch Operations Directorate . Starting with the fourth Gemini mission , the NASA launch control center in Florida ( Mercury Control Center , later the Launch Control Center ) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston , shortly after liftoff ; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission . Additionally , the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and In-Situ Resource Utilization for off-Earth exploration . Since 2010 , the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships , even adding a new launch pad ( LC-39C ) in 2015 . There are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped across the center 's 144,000 acres ( 580 km2 ) . Among the unique facilities at KSC are the 525-foot ( 160 m ) tall Vehicle Assembly Building for stacking NASA 's largest rockets , the Launch Control Center , which conducts space launches at KSC , the Operations and Checkout Building , which houses the astronauts dormitories and suit-up area , a Space Station factory , and a 3-mile ( 4.8 km ) long Shuttle Landing Facility . There is also a Visitor Complex open to the public on site .",
  "/wiki/Launch_Complex_39": "Launch Complex 39 ( LC-39 ) is a rocket launch site at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island in Florida , United States . The site and its collection of facilities were originally built for the Apollo program and later modified for the Space Shuttle program . Launch Complex 39 consists of three launch sub-complexes or pads - 39A , 39B , and 39C - a Vehicle Assembly Building ( VAB ) , a Crawlerway used by crawler-transporters to carry Mobile Launcher Platforms between the VAB and the pads , Orbiter Processing Facility buildings , a Launch Control Center which contains the firing rooms , a news facility famous for the iconic countdown clock seen in television coverage and photos , and various logistical and operational support buildings . SpaceX leases Launch Complex 39A from NASA and has modified the pad to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches . NASA began modifying Launch Complex 39B in 2007 to accommodate the now defunct Project Constellation , and is currently preparing it for the Space Launch System , whose first launch is scheduled for no earlier than June 2020 . A pad to be designated 39C , which would have been a copy of pads 39A and 39B , was originally planned for Apollo but never built . A smaller pad , 39C , was constructed from January to June 2015 , to accommodate small-lift launch vehicles . NASA launches from pads 39A and 39B have been supervised from the NASA Launch Control Center ( LCC ) , located 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) from the launch pads .

  "/wiki/Terminal_countdown_demonstration_test": "A terminal countdown demonstration test ( TCDT ) is a simulation of the final hours of a launch countdown and serves as a practice exercise in which both the launch team and flight crew rehearse launch day timelines and procedures . In the specific case of a TCDT for the Space Shuttle , the test culminated in a simulated ignition and RSLS Abort ( automated shutdown of the orbiter 's main engines ) . Following the simulated abort , the flight crew was briefed on emergency egress procedures and use of the fixed service structure slidewire system . On some earlier shuttle missions , and Apollo missions , the test would conclude with the flight crew evacuating the launch pad by use of these emergency systems , however this is no longer part of the test . Unmanned carrier rocket launches also undergo TCDTs , when countdown procedures are followed . These vary for specific rockets , for example solid-fuelled rockets would not simulate an engine shutdown , as it is impossible to shut down a solid rocket after it has been lit . TCDTs typically are carried out a few days before launch .",

Young and pilot Robert L. Crippen . It was the first American crewed space flight since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975 . STS-1 was also the only maiden test flight of a new American spacecraft to carry a crew , though it was preceded by atmospheric testing of the orbiter and ground testing of the Space Shuttle system . The launch occurred on the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight . This was a coincidence rather than a celebration of the anniversary ; a technical problem had prevented STS-1 from launching two days earlier , as was planned .",

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster": "The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was a fatal incident in the United States space program that occurred on Tuesday , January 28 , 1986 , when the Space Shuttle Challenger ( OV-099 ) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight , killing all seven crew members aboard . The crew consisted of five NASA astronauts , one payload specialist , and a civilian schoolteacher . The mission carried the designation STS-51-L and was the tenth flight for the Challenger orbiter . The spacecraft disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean , off the coast of Cape Canaveral , Florida , at 11:39 a.m. EST ( 16:39 UTC ) . The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right solid rocket booster ( SRB ) failed at liftoff . The failure was caused by the failure of O-ring seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch . The seals ' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint , allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and external fuel tank . This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB 's aft field joint attachment and the structural failure of the external tank . Aerodynamic forces broke up the orbiter . The crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation . The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown ; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft .

  "/wiki/Solid-fuel_rocket": "A solid-propellant rocket or solid rocket is a rocket with a rocket engine that uses solid propellants ( fuel/oxidizer ) . The earliest rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder ; they were used in warfare by the Chinese , Indians , Mongols and Persians , as early as the 13th century . All rockets used some form of solid or powdered propellant up until the 20th century , when liquid-propellant rockets offered more efficient and controllable alternatives . Solid rockets are still used today in military armaments worldwide , model rockets and on larger applications for their simplicity and reliability . Since solid-fuel rockets can remain in storage for a long time without much propellant degradation , and the fact that they almost always launch reliably , they have been frequently used in military applications such as missiles . The lower performance of solid propellants ( as compared to liquids ) does not favor their use as primary propulsion in modern medium-to-large launch vehicles customarily used to orbit commercial satellites and launch major space probes . Solids are , however , frequently used as strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity or as spin-stabilized add-on upper stages when higher-than-normal velocities are required .

  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster": "The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster was a fatal incident in the United States space program that occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when the Space Shuttle Columbia ( OV-102 ) disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere , killing all seven crew members . The disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program , after the 1986 breakup of Challenger soon after liftoff . During the launch of STS-107 , Columbia 's 28th mission , a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter . Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous shuttle launches , causing damage that ranged from minor to nearly catastrophic , but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious . Before re-entry , NASA managers had limited the investigation , reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed . When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth , the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure , which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart . After the disaster , Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years , as they had been after the Challenger disaster . Construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) was put on hold ; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Space Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121 . NASA ultimately made several technical and organizational changes , including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle 's thermal protection system had endured the ascent , and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found . Except for one final mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS so that the crew could use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry .",

  "/wiki/South_Bay_(San_Francisco_Bay_Area)": "Once primarily agricultural because of its highly fertile soil , Santa Clara Valley is now largely urbanized , although its far southern reaches south of Gilroy remain agrarian . The most northern urban areas are considered part of Silicon Valley . As Silicon Valley is not an actual valley , parts of the San Francisco Peninsula farther north are included in the Silicon Valley region as well . Locally , the urbanized areas of Santa Clara Valley are also referred to as part of the South Bay . Few traces of its agricultural past can still be found , but the Santa Clara Valley American Viticultural Area remains a large wine-making region . It was one of the first commercial wine-producing regions in California ( and possibly the United States ) , utilizing high-quality French varietal vines imported from France . The northern end of the Santa Clara Valley is at the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay , and the southern end is in the vicinity of Hollister . The valley is bounded by the Santa Cruz Mountains on the southwest , which separate Santa Clara Valley from the Pacific Ocean , and by the Diablo Range on the northeast . The valley is approximately 30 miles ( 50 km ) long by 15 miles ( 20 km ) wide . Its largest city , by an 86.7% margin , is San Jose . The population of the valley is 1.81 million people along with approximately 865,700 wage and salary jobs . Santa Clara Valley has a Mediterranean semi-arid climate .",

  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
  "/wiki/Redstone_Arsenal": "Redstone Arsenal ( RSA ) is a United States Army post and a census-designated place ( CDP ) adjacent to Huntsville in Madison County , Alabama , United States and is part of the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area . The Arsenal is a garrison for a number of tenants including the United States Army Materiel Command , Army 's Aviation and Missile Command , the Missile Defense Agency of the Department of Defense , and NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center . RSA has benefited from decisions by the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission . The Redstone Arsenal CDP had a population of 1,946 as of the 2010 census . The base contains a government and contractor workforce that averages 36,000 to 40,000 personnel daily . Originally a chemical weapons manufacturing facility for World War II , in the immediate post-war era it became home to the German rocket scientists that were brought to the US as part of Operation Paperclip . The team first worked on ballistic missiles , starting with V-2 rocket derivatives before moving on to a series of ever larger designs . Many of their tests were carried out at White Sands Missile Range and flights between the two locations were common . In late 1956 the Army was relieved of most of its ballistic missiles in favor of similar weapons operated by the US Air Force . The German design team was then spun off to become part of the newly founded NASA . Redstone served as the primary site for space launch vehicle design into the 1960s ."
