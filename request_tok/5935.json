The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania 's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the Point of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The Allegheny River is , by volume , the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers . Historically , the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio River by both Native Americans and European settlers . The shallow river has been made navigable upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady by a series of locks and dams constructed in the early 20th century . A 24-mile long portion of the upper river in Warren and McKean counties of Pennsylvania and Cattaraugus County in New York is the Allegheny Reservoir also known as Lake Kinzua , created by the erection of the Kinzua Dam in 1965 for flood control . The name of the river comes from one of a number of Delaware Indian phrases which are homophones of the English name , with varying translations .",

The city features 30 skyscrapers , two inclined railways , a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers . The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires , Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . Aside from steel , Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum , glass , shipbuilding , petroleum , foods , sports , transportation , computing , autos , and electronics . For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district .

  "/wiki/Bog": "A bog or bogland is a wetland that accumulates peat , a deposit of dead plant material - often mosses , and in a majority of cases , sphagnum moss . It is one of the four main types of wetlands . Other names for bogs include mire , quagmire , and muskeg ; alkaline mires are called fens . They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat . The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink . Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients . In some cases , the water is derived entirely from precipitation , in which case they are termed ombrotrophic ( cloud-fed ) . Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour , which comes from dissolved peat tannins . In general , the low fertility and cool climate result in relatively slow plant growth , but decay is even slower owing to the saturated soil . Hence , peat accumulates . Large areas of the landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat . Bogs have distinctive assemblages of animal , fungal and plant species , and are of high importance for biodiversity , particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed .",

Some distant view of The Blue Mountain dominates the southern tier of most eastern and central Pennsylvanian counties providing an ever visible backdrop cutting across the northern or western horizon . Most transport corridors and road beds piercing the barrier necessarily descend through either large water gaps ( West to east : Susquehanna , Schuylkill , Lehigh and Delaware River valleys ) or wind gaps their smaller tributary gaps cut by creeks , brooks , and lesser rivers . The descent into the southern lowlands are ramplike and before southbound travelers oft lays a scenic panorama spread from horizon to horizon . The barrier ridge forms a distinct boundary between a number of Pennsylvania 's geographical and cultural regions . To the north of the Susquehanna Gap in the south-central part of the state are the Cumberland Valley tucked in the area above the water gap as if trying to flow through with the river ; to its northwest side are the southern reaches of the Susquehanna Valley with picturesque streams channeling travel corridors deep into and over the central and western mountains and valleys - the heartland interior counties of Pennsylvania ; along the Main Branch Susquehanna , the valleys also lead into northeast Pennsylvania , into the Northern Coal Region , of the Wyoming Valley and the distant Poconos . To the Blue Mountain Ridge 's center , on the southern side lies the capital region , about Harrisburg and nearby communities , the rich farming country of the Lebanon Valley , and Pennsylvania Dutch Country of York and Lancaster Counties , the lower half of the Lehigh Valley and the lower Delaware Valley ; the latter two extend through water gaps beyond the ridgeline .",

[ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 . Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive , capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb . However , victories at Trenton and Princeton restored American confidence ."
