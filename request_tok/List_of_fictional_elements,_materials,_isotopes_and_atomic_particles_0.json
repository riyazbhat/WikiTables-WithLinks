  "/wiki/Adamant": "Adamant and similar words are used to refer to any especially hard substance , whether composed of diamond , some other gemstone , or some type of metal . Both adamant and diamond derive from the Greek word \u1f00\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 , \u1f00\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ( adamas , adamantos ) , meaning untameable . Adamantite and adamantium ( a metallic name derived from the Neo-Latin ending -ium ) are also common variants . Adamantine has , throughout ancient history , referred to anything that was made of a very hard material . Virgil describes Tartarus as having a screeching gate protected by columns of solid adamantine ( Aeneid book VI ) . Later , by the Middle Ages , the term came to refer to diamond , as it was the hardest material then known . It was in the Middle Ages , too , that adamantine hardness and the lodestone 's magnetic properties became confused and combined , leading to an alternate definition in which adamant means magnet , falsely derived from the Latin adamare , which means to love or be attached to . Another connection was the belief that adamant ( the diamond definition ) could block the effects of a magnet . This was addressed in chapter III of Pseudodoxia Epidemica , for instance . Since the word diamond is now used for the hardest gemstone , the increasingly archaic term adamant has a mostly poetic or figurative use . In that capacity , the name is frequently used in popular media and fiction to refer to a very hard substance .",
  "/wiki/Diamond": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) .",
  "/wiki/Lodestone": "A lodestone is a naturally magnetized piece of the mineral magnetite . They are naturally occurring magnets , which can attract iron . The property of magnetism was first discovered in antiquity through lodestones . Pieces of lodestone , suspended so they could turn , were the first magnetic compasses , and their importance to early navigation is indicated by the name lodestone , which in Middle English means course stone or leading stone , from the now-obsolete meaning of lode as journey , way . Lodestone is one of only a very few minerals that is found naturally magnetized . Magnetite is black or brownish-black , with a metallic luster , a Mohs hardness of 5.5-6.5 and a black streak .",
  "/wiki/Prometheus_Bound": "Prometheus Bound ( Ancient Greek : \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u0394\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 , Prom\u0113the\u00fas Desm\u1e53t\u0113s ) is an Ancient Greek tragedy . In antiquity , it was attributed to Aeschylus , but now is considered by some scholars to be the work of another hand , and perhaps one as late as c. 430 BC . Despite these doubts about its authorship , the play 's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional . The tragedy is based on the myth of Prometheus , a Titan who defies the gods and gives fire to mankind , acts for which he is subjected to perpetual punishment . Prometheus Bound was the first work in a trilogy that also included the plays Prometheus Lyomenos ( Prometheus Unbound ) and Prometheus Pyrphoros ( Prometheus the Fire-Bearer ) , neither of which has survived . Since the final two dramas of the trilogy have been lost , it is difficult to determine the author 's original intention for the work as a whole . This problem is intensified since the date of the trilogy is unknown . A reference ( lines 363-372 ) to the eruption of Mount Aetna in 479 suggests that Prometheus Bound may date from later than this event . Aside from that , however , scholars can not agree whether the play was written early or late in Aeschylus career or even whether it is a genuine work of Aeschylus .",
  "/wiki/Aeneid": "The Aeneid ( /\u026a\u02c8ni\u02d0\u026ad/ ih-NEE-id ; Latin : Aeneis [ ae\u032f\u02c8ne\u02d0\u026as ] ) is a Latin epic poem , written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC , that tells the legendary story of Aeneas , a Trojan who travelled to Italy , where he became the ancestor of the Romans . It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter . The first six of the poem 's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas 's wanderings from Troy to Italy , and the poem 's second half tells of the Trojans ' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins , under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed . The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth , having been a character in the Iliad . Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas 's wanderings , his vague association with the foundation of Rome and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas , and fashioned the Aeneid into a compelling founding myth or national epic that tied Rome to the legends of Troy , explained the Punic Wars , glorified traditional Roman virtues , and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders , heroes , and gods of Rome and Troy . The Aeneid is widely regarded as Virgil 's masterpiece and one of the greatest works of Latin literature .",

The first version , published in 1667 , consists of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse . A second edition followed in 1674 , arranged into twelve books ( in the manner of Virgil 's Aeneid ) with minor revisions throughout .

Milton 's purpose , stated in Book I , is to justify the ways of God to men .",
  "/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene": "The Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser . Books I-III were first published in 1590 , and then republished in 1596 together with books IV-VI . The Faerie Queene is notable for its form : it is one of the longest poems in the English language as well as the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza . On a literal level , the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues , and though the text is primarily an allegorical work , it can be read on several levels of allegory , including as praise ( or , later , criticism ) of Queen Elizabeth I . In Spenser 's Letter of the Authors , he states that the entire epic poem is cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices , and the aim of publishing The Faerie Queene was to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline . Spenser presented the first three books of The Faerie Queene to Elizabeth I in 1589 , probably sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh . The poem was a clear effort to gain court favour , and as a reward Elizabeth granted Spenser a pension for life amounting to \u00a350 a year , though there is no further evidence that Elizabeth I ever read any of the poem . This royal patronage elevated the poem to a level of success that made it Spenser 's defining work .",

  "/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold . The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , [ a ] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , most notably the hobbits Frodo , Sam , Merry and Pippin . Although generally known to readers as a trilogy , the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . For economic reasons , The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages . Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .",

The fantasy elements include witches and armoured polar bears ; the trilogy also alludes to concepts from physics , philosophy , and theology . It functions in part as a retelling and inversion of John Milton 's epic Paradise Lost , with Pullman commending humanity for what Milton saw as its most tragic failing , original sin . The series has attracted controversy for its criticism of religion . The London Royal National Theatre staged a two-part adaptation of the series in 2003-2004 . New Line Cinema released a film adaptation of Northern Lights , The Golden Compass , in 2007 . A BBC television series based on the novels commenced broadcast in November 2019 .

His novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) and its sequel , the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1884 ) , the latter often called The Great American Novel .

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves . [ a ] Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and , through its inclusion of astronomy , perhaps the oldest . Over much of the past two millennia , physics , chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy , but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right .

New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy . Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism , solid-state physics , and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization ; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .",

  "/wiki/Water_cycle": "The water cycle , also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle , describes the continuous movement of water on , above and below the surface of the Earth . The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice , fresh water , saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables . The water moves from one reservoir to another , such as from river to ocean , or from the ocean to the atmosphere , by the physical processes of evaporation , condensation , precipitation , infiltration , surface runoff , and subsurface flow . In doing so , the water goes through different forms : liquid , solid ( ice ) and vapor . The water cycle involves the exchange of energy , which leads to temperature changes . When water evaporates , it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment . When it condenses , it releases energy and warms the environment . These heat exchanges influence climate . The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater . The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe . It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth , through processes including erosion and sedimentation . The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet .",

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",

  "/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)": "In chemistry , a symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element . Symbols for chemical elements normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet and are written with the first letter capitalised . Earlier symbols for chemical elements stem from classical Latin and Greek vocabulary . For some elements , this is because the material was known in ancient times , while for others , the name is a more recent invention . For example , Pb is the symbol for lead ( plumbum in Latin ) ; Hg is the symbol for mercury ( hydrargyrum in Greek ) ; and He is the symbol for helium ( a new Latin name ) because helium was not known in ancient Roman times . Some symbols come from other sources , like W for tungsten ( Wolfram in German ) which was not known in Roman times . A 3-letter temporary symbol may be assigned to a newly synthesized ( or not-yet synthesized ) element . For example , Uno was the temporary symbol for hassium ( element 108 ) which had the temporary name of unniloctium , based on its atomic number being 8 greater than 100 . There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used . In addition to the letters for the element itself , additional details may be added to the symbol as superscripts or subscripts a particular isotope , ionization , or oxidation state , or other atomic detail . A few isotopes have their own specific symbols rather than just an isotopic detail added to their element symbol .",
  "/wiki/Molybdenum": "Molybdenum is a chemical element with the symbol Mo and atomic number 42 . The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum , from Ancient Greek \u039c\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 molybdos , meaning lead , since its ores were confused with lead ores . Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history , but the element was discovered ( in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals ) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele . The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm . Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth ; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals . The free element , a silvery metal with a gray cast , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element . It readily forms hard , stable carbides in alloys , and for this reason most of world production of the element ( about 80% ) is used in steel alloys , including high-strength alloys and superalloys . Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water , but when molybdenum-bearing minerals contact oxygen and water , the resulting molybdate ion MoO2\u22124 is quite soluble . Industrially , molybdenum compounds ( about 14% of world production of the element ) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications as pigments and catalysts . Molybdenum-bearing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of biological nitrogen fixation . At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria , plants , and animals , although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation . These nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a form different from other molybdenum enzymes , which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum in a molybdenum cofactor .",
  "/wiki/Atomic_number": "The atomic number or proton number ( symbol Z ) of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element . The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element . It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus . In an uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons . The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons N gives the mass number A of an atom . Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass ( and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes ) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units ( making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass ) , is within 1% of the whole number A . Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers , and hence different mass numbers , are known as isotopes . A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes ( see monoisotopic elements ) , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element ( called the relative atomic mass ) in a defined environment on Earth , determines the element 's standard atomic weight . Historically , it was these atomic weights of elements ( in comparison to hydrogen ) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century . The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number , which , before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics , merely denoted an element 's numerical place in the periodic table , whose order is approximately , but not completely , consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights . Only after 1915 , with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms , did the word Atomzahl ( and its English equivalent atomic number ) come into common use in this context .",
  "/wiki/Periodic_table": "The periodic table , also known as the periodic table of elements , is a tabular display of the chemical elements , which are arranged by atomic number , electron configuration , and recurring chemical properties . The structure of the table shows periodic trends . The seven rows of the table , called periods , generally have metals on the left and nonmetals on the right . The columns , called groups , contain elements with similar chemical behaviours . Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers : for example , group 17 elements are the halogens ; and group 18 are the noble gases . Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals . The elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) through 118 ( oganesson ) have been discovered or synthesized , completing seven full rows of the periodic table . The first 94 elements all occur naturally , though some are found only in trace amounts and a few were discovered in nature only after having first been synthesized . [ n 1 ] Elements 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors . The synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is currently being pursued : these elements would begin an eighth row , and theoretical work has been done to suggest possible candidates for this extension . Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories . The organization of the periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the various element properties , and also to predict chemical properties and behaviours of undiscovered or newly synthesized elements .",

  "/wiki/Atomic_weight": "Relative atomic mass ( symbol : Ar ) or atomic weight is a dimensionless physical quantity defined as the ratio of the average mass of atoms of a chemical element in a given sample to the atomic mass constant . The atomic mass constant ( symbol : mu ) is defined as being 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom . Since both quantities in the ratio are masses , the resulting value is dimensionless ; hence the value is said to be relative . For a single given sample , the relative atomic mass of a given element is the weighted arithmetic mean of the masses of the individual atoms ( including their isotopes ) that are present in the sample . This quantity can vary substantially between samples because the sample 's origin ( and therefore its radioactive history or diffusion history ) may have produced unique combinations of isotopic abundances . For example , due to a different mixture of stable carbon-12 and carbon-13 isotopes , a sample of elemental carbon from volcanic methane will have a different relative atomic mass than one collected from plant or animal tissues . The more common , and more specific quantity known as standard atomic weight ( Ar , standard ) is an application of the relative atomic mass values obtained from multiple different samples . It is sometimes interpreted as the expected range of the relative atomic mass values for the atoms of a given element from all terrestrial sources , with the various sources being taken from Earth . Atomic weight is often loosely and incorrectly used as a synonym for standard atomic weight ( incorrectly because standard atomic weights are not from a single sample ) . Standard atomic weight is nevertheless the most widely published variant of relative atomic mass . Additionally , the continued use of the term atomic weight ( for any element ) as opposed to relative atomic mass has attracted considerable controversy since at least the 1960s , mainly due to the technical difference between weight and mass in physics . Still , both terms are officially sanctioned by the IUPAC .",

Developed by screenwriter Gene L. Coon in 1967 for the original Star Trek ( TOS ) series , Klingons were swarthy humanoids characterized by prideful ruthlessness and brutality . Klingons practiced feudalism and authoritarianism , with a warrior caste relying on slave labor . With a greatly expanded budget for makeup and effects , the Klingons were completely redesigned for Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) , acquiring ridged foreheads . In subsequent television series and in later films , the militaristic traits of the Klingons were bolstered by an increased sense of honor and strict warrior code similar to those of bushido . Klingons are recurring antagonists in the 1960s television series Star Trek , and have appeared in all subsequent series , along with ten of the Star Trek feature films . Initially intended to be antagonists for the crew of the USS Enterprise , the Klingons became a close ally of humanity in Star Trek : The Next Generation . In the 1990s series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , humans and Klingons join with the Romulans to fight the Dominion . Among the elements created for the revised Klingons was a complete Klingon language , developed by Marc Okrand from gibberish suggested by actor James Doohan . Spoken Klingon has entered popular culture , even to the extent that the works of William Shakespeare and parts of the Bible have been translated into it .

  "/wiki/Half-life": "Half-life ( symbol t1\u20442 ) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value . The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo , or how long stable atoms survive , radioactive decay . The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential or non-exponential decay . For example , the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body . The converse of half-life is doubling time . The original term , half-life period , dating to Ernest Rutherford 's discovery of the principle in 1907 , was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s . Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element 's half-life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206 . Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity , and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation . The accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half-lives elapsed .",

The Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th century BC ; eventually the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath became part of the oral tradition of Homer 's epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Aside from this narrative deposit in ancient Greek literature , pictorial representations of gods , heroes , and mythic episodes featured prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .",
  "/wiki/Rick_Riordan": "Richard Russell Riordan Jr. ( /\u02c8ra\u026a\u0259rd\u0259n/ ; born June 5 , 1964 ) is an American author . He is known for writing the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series , about a twelve-year-old Percy Jackson who discovers he is a son of Greek God Poseidon . Riordan 's books have been translated into forty-two languages and sold more than thirty million copies in the US . 20th Century Fox has adapted the first two books of his Percy Jackson series as part of a series of films . His books have spawned related media , such as graphic novels and short story collections . Riordan 's first full-length novel was Big Red Tequila , which became the first book in the Tres Navarre series . His big breakthrough was The Lightning Thief ( 2005 ) , the first novel in the five-volume Percy Jackson series , which placed a group of adolescents in a Greco-Roman mythological setting . Since then , Riordan has written The Kane Chronicles trilogy and The Heroes of Olympus series . The Kane Chronicles ( 2010-2012 ) focused on Egyptian mythology ; The Heroes of Olympus was the sequel to the Percy Jackson series . Riordan also helped Scholastic Press develop The 39 Clues series and its spinoffs , and penned its first book , The Maze of Bones ( 2008 ) .

  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Dr._Strangelove": "Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb , more commonly known simply as Dr. Strangelove , is a 1964 black comedy film that satirizes the Cold War fears of a nuclear conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States . The film was directed , produced , and co-written by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers , George C. Scott , Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens . Production took place in the United Kingdom . The film is loosely based on Peter George 's thriller novel Red Alert ( 1958 ) . The story concerns an unhinged United States Air Force general who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union . It follows the President of the United States , his advisors , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse . It separately follows the crew of one B-52 bomber as they try to deliver their payload . In 1989 , the United States Library of Congress included Dr. Strangelove in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry . It was listed as number three on AFI 's 100 Years.100 Laughs list .",

  "/wiki/Cobalt": "Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27 . Like nickel , cobalt is found in the Earth 's crust only in chemically combined form , save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron . The free element , produced by reductive smelting , is a hard , lustrous , silver-gray metal . Cobalt-based blue pigments ( cobalt blue ) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints , and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass , but the color was later thought to be due to the known metal bismuth . Miners had long used the name kobold ore ( German for goblin ore ) for some of the blue-pigment-producing minerals ; they were so named because they were poor in known metals , and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted . In 1735 , such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal ( the first discovered since ancient times ) , and this was ultimately named for the kobold . Today , some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores , such as cobaltite ( CoAsS ) . The element is , however , more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining . The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production . World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes ( according to Natural Resources Canada ) , and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50% . Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries , and in the manufacture of magnetic , wear-resistant and high-strength alloys . The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt ( II ) aluminate ( CoAl2O4 , cobalt blue ) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass , ceramics , inks , paints and varnishes .",
  "/wiki/Thorium": "Thorium is a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element with the symbol Th and atomic number 90 . Thorium is silvery and tarnishes black when it is exposed to air , forming thorium dioxide ; it is moderately hard , malleable , and has a high melting point . Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation state ; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided . All known thorium isotopes are unstable . The most stable isotope , 232Th , has a half-life of 14.05 billion years , or about the age of the universe ; it decays very slowly via alpha decay , starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb . On Earth , thorium , bismuth , and uranium are the only three radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements . [ a ] It is estimated to be over three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth 's crust , and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth metals . Thorium was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius , who named it after Thor , the Norse god of thunder . Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century . Thorium 's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century . In the second half of the century , thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactivity . Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions .",
  "/wiki/Atomic_weapons": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_fallout": "Nuclear fallout , or fallout , is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear blast , so called because it falls out of the sky after the explosion and the shock wave have passed . It commonly refers to the radioactive dust and ash created when a nuclear weapon explodes . The amount and spread of fallout is a product of the size of the weapon and the altitude at which it is detonated . Fallout may get entrained with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black rain ( rain darkened by soot and other particulates , which fell within 30-40 minutes of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) . This radioactive dust , usually consisting of fission products mixed with bystanding atoms that are neutron-activated by exposure , is a form of radioactive contamination ."
