  "/wiki/D-Day": "The Normandy landings were the landing operations on Tuesday , 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II . Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day , it was the largest seaborne invasion in history . The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France ( and later western Europe ) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front . Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D-Day was far from ideal , and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks , as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion . The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault - the landing of 24,000 American , British , and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight . Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30 . The target 50-mile ( 80 km ) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors : Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno , and Sword . Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions , particularly at Utah and Omaha . The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches , and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes , metal tripods , and barbed wire , making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous ."
