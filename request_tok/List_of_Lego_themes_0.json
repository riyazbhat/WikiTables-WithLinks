  "/wiki/Buildings": "A building , or edifice , is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place , such as a house or factory . Buildings come in a variety of sizes , shapes , and functions , and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors , from building materials available , to weather conditions , land prices , ground conditions , specific uses , and aesthetic reasons . To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures . Buildings serve several societal needs - primarily as shelter from weather , security , living space , privacy , to store belongings , and to comfortably live and work . A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat ( a place of comfort and safety ) and the outside ( a place that at times may be harsh and harmful ) . Ever since the first cave paintings , buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression . In recent years , interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings .",

  "/wiki/Handicraft": "A handicraft , sometimes more precisely expressed as artisanal handicraft or handmade , is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools . It is a traditional main sector of craft and applies to a wide range of creative and design activities that are related to making things with one 's hands and skill , including work with textiles , moldable and rigid materials , paper , plant fibers , etc . One of the world 's oldest handicraft is Dhokra ; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used . Usually , the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items ( whether for personal use or as products ) that are both practical and aesthetic . Handicraft industries are those that produce things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality . Machines are not used . Collective terms for handicrafts include artisanry , handicrafting , crafting , handicraftsmanship and handcrafting . The term arts and crafts is also applied , especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists ' and children 's output rather than items crafted for daily use , but this distinction is not formal , and the term is easily confused with the Arts and Crafts design movement , which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic . Handicraft has its roots in the rural crafts - the material-goods necessities - of ancient civilizations , and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries , while others are modern inventions or popularizations of crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area . Many handcrafters use natural , even entirely indigenous , materials while others may prefer modern , non-traditional materials , and even upcycle industrial materials . The individual artisanship of a handcrafted item is the paramount criterion ; those made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods . Seen as developing the skills and creative interests of students , generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade , handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems , both informally and formally .",
