The film is based on the Shaolin Monastery in China and depicts Shaolin Kung Fu . The film was among the first major co-productions between Hong Kong and mainland China , and the first to be filmed in mainland China with a mostly mainland cast . It was the first martial arts film to be made in mainland China ; up until then , kung fu films were made in Hong Kong . It was also the first film to be shot at the Shaolin Monastery . It became one of China 's biggest blockbusters of all time , estimated to have sold over 300 million tickets at the Chinese box office . The film 's success established Jet Li as the first Mainland Chinese star of Hong Kong , and later Hollywood . It was also largely responsible for turning the Shaolin Monastery into a major tourist destination , both within China and internationally . A remake of the film was released in 2011 titled Shaolin and starred Andy Lau , Nicholas Tse and Jackie Chan",
  "/wiki/Cinema_of_China": "The cinema of Mainland China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan . Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film , Dingjun Mountain , was made in 1905 . In the early decades the film industry was centred on Shanghai . The first sound film , Sing-Song Girl Red Peony , using the sound-on-disc technology , was made in 1931 . The 1930s , considered the first Golden Period of Chinese cinema , saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement . The dispute between Nationalists and Communists was reflected in the films produced . After the Japanese invasion of China and the occupation of Shanghai , the industry in the city was severely curtailed , with filmmakers moving to Hong Kong , Chongqing and other places . A Solitary Island period began in Shanghai , where the filmmakers who remained worked in the foreign concessions . Princess Iron Fan ( 1941 ) , the first Chinese animated feature film , was released at the end of this period . It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later Osamu Tezuka . After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941 , and until the end of the war in 1945 , the film industry in the city was under Japanese control . After the end of the war , a second golden age took place , with production in Shanghai resuming",
  "/wiki/Cinema_of_Hong_Kong": "The cinema of Hong Kong ( Chinese : \u9999\u6e2f\u96fb\u5f71 ) is one of the three major threads in the history of Chinese language cinema , alongside the cinema of China , and the cinema of Taiwan . As a former British colony , Hong Kong had a greater degree of political and economic freedom than mainland China and Taiwan , and developed into a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world ( including its worldwide diaspora ) . For decades , Hong Kong was the third largest motion picture industry in the world ( after Indian cinema and Hollywood ) and the second largest exporter . Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong 's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 , Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage . In the West , Hong Kong 's vigorous pop cinema ( especially Hong Kong action cinema ) has long had a strong cult following , which is now arguably a part of the cultural mainstream , widely available and imitated . Economically , the film industry together with the value added of cultural and creative industries represents 5 per cent of Hong Kong 's economy",

  "/wiki/Steven_Spielberg": "Steven Allan Spielberg ( /\u02c8spi\u02d0lb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/ ; born December 18 , 1946 ) is an American filmmaker . He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history . Spielberg started in Hollywood directing television and several minor theatrical releases . He became a household name as the director of Jaws ( 1975 ) , which was critically and commercially successful and is considered the first summer blockbuster . His subsequent releases focused typically on science fiction/adventure films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) , Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 ) , E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) , and Jurassic Park ( 1993 ) , which became archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking .

He has largely adhered to this practice during the 21st century , with Munich ( 2005 ) , Lincoln ( 2012 ) , Bridge of Spies ( 2015 ) , and The Post ( 2017 ) . He co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Studios , where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for several successful film trilogies , tetralogies and more including the Gremlins , Back to the Future , Men in Black , and the Transformers series .

  "/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States": "The cinema of the United States , often metonymously referred to as Hollywood , has had a large effect on the film industry in general since the early 20th century . The dominant style of American cinema is classical Hollywood cinema , which developed from 1913 to 1969 and characterizes most films made there to this day . While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema , American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry . It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema , with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year . While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom ( 299 ) , Canada ( 206 ) , Australia , and New Zealand also produce films in the same language , they are not considered part of the Hollywood system . Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema . Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles , often in Spanish or French . Contemporary Hollywood off-shores production to Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . Hollywood is considered the oldest film industry where earliest film studios and production companies emerged , it is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema - among them comedy , drama , action , the musical , romance , horror , science fiction , and the war epic - having set an example for other national film industries . In 1878 , Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion . In 1894 , the world 's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City , using Thomas Edison 's kinetoscope . The United States produced the world 's first sync-sound musical film , The Jazz Singer , in 1927 , and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades",

The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina [ it ] , a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers , who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896 . Since its beginning , Italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide . As of 2018 , Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film ( the most of any country ) as well as 12 Palmes d'Or ( the second-most of any country ) , one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears . Italy is a birthplace of Art Cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been the most important factor in the history of Italian movies . In the early 1900s , artistic and epic films such as Otello ( 1906 ) , The Last Days of Pompeii ( 1908 ) , L'Inferno ( 1911 ) , Quo Vadis ( 1913 ) , and Cabiria ( 1914 ) , were made as adaptations of books or stage plays . Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs , lavish costumes , and record budgets , to produce pioneering films . One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements , Italian Futurism , took place in Italy in the late 1910s . After a period of decline in the 1920s , the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film . A popular Italian genre during this period , the Telefoni Bianchi , consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds . While Italy 's Fascist government provided financial support for the nation 's film industry , most notably the construction of the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios ( the largest film studio in Europe ) , it also engaged in censorship , and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films .

Note that , in line with the definition above , this list does not include any Soviet television series or television movies , which were not shown in cinemas of the Soviet Union . The annual list includes sales during each year only , which often means that the total number of tickets sold was bigger . As an example , according to the list below the film The Red Snowball Tree , the top seller of the year 1974 , sold 62.5 million tickets during that year . But the total number of sold tickets during all years was bigger ( former deputy director of the USSR GosKino Boris Pavlenok named 140 million , however , it was clearly exaggeration ) .
