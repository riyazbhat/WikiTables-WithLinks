  "/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty": "The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty , commonly known as the National Trust , is an independent charity and membership organisation for environmental and heritage conservation in England , Wales and Northern Ireland . The trust describes itself as a charity that works to preserve and protect historic places and spaces - for ever , for everyone . The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen . In Scotland , there is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland . The National Trust has a unique special power to prevent its inalienable land being sold off , although this can be over-ridden by Parliamentary procedure . The National Trust has been the beneficiary of many large donations and bequests . It owns over 500 heritage properties , which include many historic houses and gardens , industrial monuments , and social history sites . Most of these are open to the public , usually for a charge . Others are leased to tenants on terms that manage to preserve their character whilst providing for more limited public access .

The museum is housed in a former cider making factory at Pomona Place , Hereford , England , dating back to 1888 . This was the birthplace of Bulmer 's Cider . Henry Percival Bulmer started making cider in 1887 and was joined by his brother Fred from Cambridge . A year later they purchased a plot of ground on the outskirts of Hereford to build a 'shack ' to make and store cider .

  "/wiki/Goodrich_Castle": "Goodrich Castle is a Norman medieval castle ruin north of the village of Goodrich in Herefordshire , England , controlling a key location between Monmouth and Ross-on-Wye . It was praised by William Wordsworth as the noblest ruin in Herefordshire and is considered by historian Adrian Pettifer to be the most splendid in the county , and one of the best examples of English military architecture . Goodrich Castle was probably built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England , initially as an earth and wooden fortification . In the middle of the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone keep , and was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a concentric structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences . The success of Goodrich 's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years . It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times . Held first by Parliamentary and then Royalist forces in the English Civil War of the 1640s , Goodrich was finally successfully besieged by Colonel John Birch in 1646 with the help of the huge Roaring Meg mortar , resulting in the subsequent slighting of the castle and its descent into ruin . At the end of the 18th century , however , Goodrich became a noted picturesque ruin and the subject of many paintings and poems ; events at the castle provided the inspiration for Wordsworth 's famous 1798 poem We are Seven . By the 20th century the site was a well-known tourist location , now owned by English Heritage and open to the public .",

  "/wiki/Medieval": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

A larger mappa mundi , the Ebstorf map , was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943 , though photographs of it survive . The Hereford Mappa Mundi hung , with little regard , for many years on a wall of a choir aisle in the cathedral . During the troubled times of the Commonwealth the map had been laid beneath the floor of Bishop Audley 's Chantry , where it remained secreted for some time .

During the Second World War , for safety reasons , the mappa mundi and other valuable manuscripts from Hereford Cathedral Library were kept elsewhere and returned to the collection in 1946 . In 1988 , a financial crisis in the Diocese of Hereford caused the Dean and Chapter to propose selling the mappa mundi .
