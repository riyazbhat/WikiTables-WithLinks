Persian buildings vary from peasant huts to tea houses , and garden pavilions to some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen .

Without sudden innovations , and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks , it has achieved an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries . Its paramount virtues are : a marked feeling for form and scale ; structural inventiveness , especially in vault and dome construction ; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture . Traditionally , the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic symbolism by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven . This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia , but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well .
