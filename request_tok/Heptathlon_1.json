The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum , the capital of Lower Pannonia . The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century , but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241-42 . Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century . The Battle of Moh\u00e1cs , in 1526 , was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule . After the reconquest of Buda in 1686 , the region entered a new age of prosperity , with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda , \u00d3buda , and Pest on 17 November 1873 , with the name 'Budapest ' given to the new capital . Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a great power that dissolved in 1918 , following World War I . The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 , the Battle of Budapest in 1945 , and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 .

  "/wiki/Seville": "Seville ( /s\u0259\u02c8v\u026al/ ; Spanish : Sevilla [ se\u02c8\u03b2i\u028ea ] ( listen ) ) is a Spanish city , the capital of the autonomous community of Andalusia and the province of Seville . It is situated on the lower reaches of the River Guadalquivir , in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula . Seville has a municipal population of about 690,000 as of 2016 [ update ] , and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million , making it the largest city in Andalusia , the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European Union . Its old town , with an area of 4 square kilometres ( 2 sq mi ) , contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Alc\u00e1zar palace complex , the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies . The Seville harbour , located about 80 kilometres ( 50 miles ) from the Atlantic Ocean , is the only river port in Spain [ citation needed ] . Seville experiences high temperatures in the Summer , with daily maximums routinely above 35 \u00b0C ( 95 \u00b0F ) in July and August . Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis . It became known as Ishbiliyya after the Muslim conquest in 712 . During the Muslim rule in Spain , Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248 . After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature . In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth . Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz"
