As this was the first time a national championship was held , it is considered ( unofficially ) the first season of NCAA Division I ice hockey as it is the first time that any college teams would have to conform to NCAA regulations regarding recruitment , scholarship , eligibility , etc . The tournament was , itself , born out of a desire to definitively decide the best collegiate team in the country . With only a handful of universities even playing ice hockey ( indoor ice rinks were fairly expensive to operate ) and even less playing a decent number of games each year only four teams were selected to play in the tournament .",
