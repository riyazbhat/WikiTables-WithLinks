  "/wiki/Banana_leaf_rice": "Banana leaf rice is a traditional method of serving rice dishes in South Indian cuisine . Due to the migration of South Indians , banana leaf rice can also be found in areas with significant ethnic South Indian diaspora such as Malaysia and Singapore . In banana leaf meals , white rice ( or parboiled rice in authentic South Indian restaurants ) is served on a banana leaf with an assortment of vegetables , pickles , appalam and other regional condiments ( usually sour , salty or spicy ) . The banana leaf acts as a disposable plate and it in itself is not consumed . The choice of banana leaves is mainly due to the broad leaves as well as to the ubiquity of the plant in South India . Typically , only vegetarian gravy ( e.g . sambar ) will be served on the rice as it is meant to be a traditional vegetarian dish . However , sometimes boiled eggs , curried or fried meat or seafood are served as well . Traditionally , there will be two servings of rice with the first being served with gravy , side dishes and condiments whilst the second serving will be just rice with curd as a palate cleanser . Banana leaf meals are eaten by hand . Traditionally only the right hand is used , and only the tips of the fingers should touch the food . Any part of the finger beyond the first knuckle or the palm must not touch the food .",

The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule , particularly the Mughal rule . Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples . Historical events such as foreign invasions , trade relations , and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country . The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India . A number of these such as the potato , tomatoes , chillies , peanuts , and Guava have become staples in many regions of India . Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations ; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe 's Age of Discovery .

  "/wiki/Stir_frying": "Stir frying ( Chinese : \u7092 ; pinyin : ch\u01ceo ) is a Chinese cooking technique in which ingredients are fried in a small amount of very hot oil while being stirred in a wok . The technique originated in China and in recent centuries has spread into other parts of Asia and the West . Scholars think that wok ( or pan ) frying may have been used as early as the Han dynasty ( 206 B.C . - 220 A.D. ) for drying grain , not for cooking , but it was not until the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) that the wok reached its modern shape and allowed quick cooking in hot oil . Well into the 20th century , while restaurants and affluent families could afford the oil and fuel needed for stir fry , the most widely used cooking techniques remained boiling and steaming . Stir fry cooking came to predominate over the course of the century as more people could afford oil and fuel , and in the West spread beyond Chinese communities . Stir frying and Chinese food have been recommended as both healthy and appealing for their skillful use of vegetables , meats , and fish which are moderate in their fat content and sauces which are not overly rich , provided calories are kept at a reasonable level . The English language term stir-fry was coined by Y.R . Chao in Buwei Yang Chao 's book How to Cook and Eat in Chinese ( 1945 ) , to describe the ch\u01ceo technique .",

  "/wiki/Coconut_milk": "Coconut milk is an opaque , milky-white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts . The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk is due to its high oil content , most of which is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , Oceania , South Asia , and East Africa . It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean , tropical Latin America , and West Africa , where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era . Coconut milk is differentiated into subtypes based on fat content . They can be generalized into coconut cream ( or thick coconut milk ) with the highest amount of fat ; coconut milk ( or thin coconut milk ) with a maximum of around 20% fat ; and coconut skim milk with negligible amounts of fat . This terminology is not always followed in commercial coconut milk sold in western countries . Coconut milk can also be used to produce milk substitutes ( differentiated as coconut milk beverages ) . These products are not the same as regular coconut milk products which are meant for cooking , not drinking .

Curry is generally prepared in a sauce . Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India , where the word also originated , may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree . There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries ' . For example , in original traditional cuisines , the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition , religious practice , and , to some extent , family preference . Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients , spicing , and cooking methods . Spices are used both whole and ground , cooked or raw , and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results . The main spices found in most curry powders of the Indian subcontinent are coriander , cumin , and turmeric . A wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included ( fish , lentils , red or white meat , rice , and vegetables ) . Curry powder , a commercially prepared mixture of spices , is largely a Western creation , dating to the 18th century . Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the British Colonial government and army returning to Britain . Outside of the Indian subcontinent , curry may also be used to describe the various unrelated native dishes of Island Southeast Asia , Mainland Southeast Asia , and Oceania which use coconut milk or spice pastes and are commonly eaten over rice ( like the Filipino ginataan and Thai gaeng class of dishes ) .",
  "/wiki/Coconut": "The coconut tree ( Cocos nucifera ) is a member of the palm tree family ( Arecaceae ) and the only known living species of the genus Cocos . The term coconut ( or the archaic cocoanut ) can refer to the whole coconut palm , the seed , or the fruit , which botanically is a drupe , not a nut . The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco , meaning 'head ' or 'skull ' after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features . Coconuts are known for their versatility of uses , ranging from food to cosmetics . The inner flesh of the mature seed , as well as the coconut milk extracted from it , forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics . Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid , called coconut water or coconut juice . Mature , ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds , or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh , charcoal from the hard shell , and coir from the fibrous husk . Dried coconut flesh is called copra , and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking - frying in particular - as well as in soaps and cosmetics . The hard shells , fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating .

  "/wiki/Pickling": "Pickling is the process of preserving or extending the shelf life of food by either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar .

The resulting food is called a pickle , or , to prevent ambiguity , prefaced with pickled . Foods that are pickled include vegetables , fruits , meats , fish , dairy and eggs . A distinguishing characteristic is a pH of 4.6 or lower , which is sufficient to kill most bacteria . Pickling can preserve perishable foods for months . Antimicrobial herbs and spices , such as mustard seed , garlic , cinnamon or cloves , are often added . If the food contains sufficient moisture , a pickling brine may be produced simply by adding dry salt . For example , sauerkraut and Korean kimchi are produced by salting the vegetables to draw out excess water . Natural fermentation at room temperature , by lactic acid bacteria , produces the required acidity . Other pickles are made by placing vegetables in vinegar .",
