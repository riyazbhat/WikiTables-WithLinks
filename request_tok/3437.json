  "/wiki/North_Carolina's_2nd_congressional_district": "North Carolina 's 2nd congressional district is located in the central and eastern parts of the state . The district currently includes southern and eastern Wake County , northern Johnston County , southern Nash County , far western Wilson County , and all of Franklin and Harnett counties . The 2nd district has been represented by Republican Rep. George Holding since 2017 . He is not running for re-election in 2020 . Established by the state legislature after the American Civil War , the district was known as The Black Second ; counties included in the district were mostly majority-black in population . All four of North Carolina 's Republican African-American congressmen elected in the post-Civil War era ( ending with George Henry White ) represented this district , as did white yeoman farmer Curtis Hooks Brogden of Wayne County , a Republican ally of former Governor William Woods Holden . After North Carolina Democrats regained control of the state legislature in the 1870s ( using intimidation by the Red Shirts and other paramilitary groups to reduce the number of blacks voting ) , they passed voter registration and electoral laws that restricted voter rolls . Blacks continued to get elected to local and state offices . The state legislature passed a new constitutional amendment in 1900 , which effectively disfranchised blacks altogether . This ended the election of blacks to local , state or Congressional offices until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s , which enforced constitutional voting rights . Thousands of blacks migrated north from the state in the Great Migration during the first half of the twentieth century , seeking job opportunities and education . By the later twentieth century , before the 1990s , the 2nd district was roughly 40 % black .",
