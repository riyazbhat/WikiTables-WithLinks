  "/wiki/Pr\u00f3xima_Estaci\u00f3n:_Esperanza": "Pr\u00f3xima Estaci\u00f3n : Esperanza ( English : Next Stop : Hope ) is an album by Manu Chao . It was released in Europe in 2001 . It was released in the United States on 5 June 2001 on Virgin Records . Chao and others sing in Arabic , English , French , Galician , Portuguese and Spanish on this album . The backing track to Homens , a tight rap about various kinds of men , written and performed by Brazilian journalist ( and Chao 's friend ) Valeria dos Santos Costa , is identical to the backing track for Bongo Bong , Chao 's successful single from four years earlier ; however , in the short documentary film Infinita tristeza ( included within the bonus section of his 2002 live DVD Babylonia en Guagua ) , Chao stated that Homens was the song for which the well-known backing track was originally recorded . The final song on the album , Infinita Tristeza , does not contain any vocals by Chao , but it consists of the same backing track as Me Gustas T\u00fa , over which several samples and soundbites are layered ; most of them come from a cartoon-based TV documentary film about pregnancy and childbirth , produced in 1977 by TVE and aimed at children . A number of voice samples from the documentary are looped and repeated throughout the track in Chao 's typical fragmented style . The album title comes from a sample of an announcement for the Esperanza station of Madrid Metro 's Line 4 ; in Spanish esperanza means hope . Another Line 4 station , named Avenida de la Paz [ literally Peace Avenue ] is also mentioned several times on the album , but the two stations are actually several blocks apart , and the sample used by Chao actually consists of two separate announcements pasted together . The voice actor Javier Dot\u00fa and a Metro announcer later sued for infringement of intellectual property rights over the use of their voices . Pr\u00f3xima Estaci\u00f3n : Esperanza received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance . In 2010 Esperanza was listed at # 65 in Rolling Stone 's Best Albums of the Decade .",

It turned out to be the band 's last studio effort , as two years later the singer Bertrand Cantat was imprisoned for the murder of Marie Trintignant , and after his release the attempts to reunite the band and produce a new album proved unsuccessful ( only one new track was released in 2008 ) ; Noir D\u00e9sir was officially disbanded in November 2010 . The group received five Victoires de la Musique award nominations in 2001 , winning both Best Rock Album of the Year for Des Visages des Figures and Music Video of the Year for Le vent nous portera . During that event , Bertrand Cantat read out a speech on behalf of the band , addressed to Jean-Marie Messier , then CEO of Vivendi , the group that had recently acquired Noir D\u00e9sir 's record company , Universal , and ( according to him ) used the band 's name and reputation to somehow cover up his disfigurement of french culture for the sake of profit , ending with the phrase and if we are embarked on the same planet , we definitely are not from the same world , sparking numerous commentaries in the media . In 2010 the French edition of Rolling Stone magazine named this album the 60th greatest French rock album ( out of 100 ) . All music was composed by Noir D\u00e9sir , where not otherwise specified .

  "/wiki/Cinqui\u00e8me_As": "Cinqui\u00e8me As is the fifth studio album by MC Solaar , and was released in 2001 . It is slightly different from his previous works because of a stronger emphasis on a string background . The album gained exposure in the United States after La Belle et le Bad Boy was heard on an episode of Sex and the City . Musically , the album features more R & B themes featuring a layering of a female voice on a few tracks , and it is especially notable and true to the MC Solaar character which is strong emotion expressed in the delivery and lyrics . The album pays tribute to Senegal , where he spent his childhood . He uses the album to condemn the role of the World Bank in developing nations . This is most apparent on the track Les Colonies , where the lyrics state , Dans cette \u00e8re de n\u00e9goce o\u00f9 ne vivent que les big boss/ Rentabilit\u00e9 - instabilit\u00e9 - imb\u00e9cillit\u00e9/ N'ont fait qu'augmenter les taux de mortalit\u00e9 , meaning , In this era of trade where only the big bosses live/ Profitability - instability - imbecility/ Have done nothing but increase rates of mortality , referring to policies of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . MC Solaar also discusses the condition of African immigrants in France . He himself emigrated with his family to the suburbs of Paris as a teenager , and he talks about this experience in the song Leve-toi et rap . MC Solaar 's message is seen throughout the lyrics and the visual design of the album . The album cover is a picture of a group of men , including the artist himself , all shirtless , as if trying to convey an image of slaves about to embark on a slave ship . However , upon taking a closer look , it appears that the men are African wrestlers .",
