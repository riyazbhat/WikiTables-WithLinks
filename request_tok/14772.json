After the war , many freedmen continued to work on plantations in the rural area , which was devoted to agriculture . In 1881 the Tuskegee Normal School ( now Tuskegee University , a historically black college ) was founded by Lewis Adams , a former slave whose father , Jesse Adams , a slave owner , allowed him to be educated . Its first founding principal was Booker T. Washington , who developed a national reputation and philanthropic network to support education of freedmen and their children .
