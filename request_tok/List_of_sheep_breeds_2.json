  "/wiki/California_Red_sheep": "The California Red is a breed of domestic sheep developed in the United States . It is so named because its lambs are born all red , and retain this color in their faces and limbs in to adulthood . In the early 1970s , Dr. Glenn Spurlock of Davis , California crossed Tunis sheep and Barbados Blackbelly sheep , and the California Red is consequently a dual-purpose breed with many of the qualities of its forebears , the out-of season breeding qualities and fleece of the Tunis and the heat tolerance and carcase quality of the Blackbelly . Spurlock actually set out to create a new hair sheep like the Barbados Blackbelly , but though he failed to do so - California Reds have reddish tan hairs intermingled with white wool . - he and other breeders continued to keep developing the strain anyway . The California Red can lamb out of season , thus being able to produce multiple lamb crops in a year . It also functions well in hot weather , and is polled in both sexes",
