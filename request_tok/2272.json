After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper .

The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions .

  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40 % of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",

These boarding schools were first established by Christian missionaries of various denominations , who often started schools on reservations , especially in the lightly populated areas of the West . The government paid religious orders to provide basic education to Native American children on reservations . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , with the last residential schools closing as late as 1973 . The Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) founded additional boarding schools based on the assimilation model of the off-reservation Carlisle Indian Industrial School . Children were typically immersed in European-American culture through forced changes that removed indigenous cultural signifiers . These methods included being forced to have European-American style haircuts , being forbidden to speak their Indigenous languages , and having their real names replaced by European names to both civilize and Christianize them . ( Similarly , Evenk children were required to speak Russian when sent to boarding schools in the former Soviet Union . ) The experience of the schools was usually harsh and sometimes deadly , especially for the younger children who were forcibly separated from their families . The children were forced to abandon their Native American identities and cultures .

The Wisconsin Supreme Court and the United States Court of Claims had drawn opposing conclusions about the effect of the termination on Menominee hunting and fishing rights on their former reservation land . The U.S. Supreme Court determined that the tribe had not lost traditional hunting and fishing rights as a result of termination , as Congress had not clearly ended these in its legislation . The tribe regained federal recognition in 1973 in an act of Congress , and re-established its reservation in 1975 . They operate under a written constitution establishing an elected government .

  "/wiki/US-51": "U.S. Route 51 or U.S. Highway 51 ( US 51 ) is a major south-north United States highway that extends 1,277 miles ( 2,055 km ) from the western suburbs of New Orleans , Louisiana , to within 150 feet ( 46 m ) of the Wisconsin-Michigan state line . As most of the United States Numbered Highways ending with 1 , it is a cross-country north-south route extending from the Gulf Coast region to the Great Lakes region . Much of the highway in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin runs parallel to or is cosigned with Interstate 39 ( I-39 ) and much of the route in several states also parallels the Illinois Central Railroad . From LaPlace , Louisiana , Mississippi , to Memphis , Tennessee , much of that portion of US 51 runs largely parallel or is concurrent with Interstate 55 ( I-55 ) . The highway 's northern terminus is between Hurley , Wisconsin , and Ironwood , Michigan , where it ends with a T interchange at US 2 . Its southern terminus is in Laplace , Louisiana , ending at US 61 . US 51 travels in the states of Louisiana , Mississippi , Tennessee , Kentucky , Illinois , and Wisconsin . In addition to singing about US 61 on his album Highway 61 Revisited , musician Bob Dylan also commemorated US 51 , covering the folk song Highway 51 Blues , earlier recorded by both Curtis Jones and Tommy McClennan , on his eponymous album Bob Dylan . The North Mississippi Allstars also paid tribute to the highway in the title track of their album 51 Phantom . In Memphis , Tennessee , all of US 51 south of South Parkway East was renamed from Bellevue Boulevard to Elvis Presley Boulevard . Graceland sits on this highway , in the subdivision of Whitehaven . In 2004 , the six states that US 51 traverses banded together as the Explore Hwy 51 Coalition to help promote this All-American Road .",
