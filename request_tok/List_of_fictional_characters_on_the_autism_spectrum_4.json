Overwatch is Blizzard 's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan .

Ubisoft Montreal studied player feedback from the first game to assess what could be improved in Watch Dogs 2 and the setting was researched by making frequent trips to California .

Real hackers were consulted to validate scripts and game mechanics for authenticity and references to real-life hacktivism were fictionalized , like the Project Chanology protest . The original soundtrack was composed by Hudson Mohawke .
