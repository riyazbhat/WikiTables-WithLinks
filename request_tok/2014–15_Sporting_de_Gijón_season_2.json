  "/wiki/Transfer_window": "A transfer window is the period during the year in which a football club can transfer players from other playing staff into their playing staff . Such a transfer is completed by registering the player into the new club through FIFA . Transfer window is the unofficial term commonly used by the media for the concept of registration period as described in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Player . According to the rules , each national football association decides on the time ( such as the dates ) of the 'window ' but it may not exceed 12 weeks . The second registration period occurs during the season and may not exceed four weeks . The transfer window of a given football association governs only international transfers into that football association . International transfers out of an association are always possible to those associations that have an open window . The transfer window of the association that the player is leaving does not have to be open . The window was introduced in response to negotiations with the European Commission . The system has been used in many European leagues before being brought into compulsory effect by FIFA during the 2002-03 season . English football was initially behind the plans when they were proposed in the early 1990s , in the hope that it would improve teams ' stability and prevent agents from searching for deals all year around , but by the time it was eventually introduced they had to be persuaded that it would work . However , the exact regulations and possible exceptions are established by each competition 's governing body rather than by the national football association .",
  "/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)": "In professional football , a transfer is the action taken whenever a player under contract moves between clubs . It refers to the transferring of a player 's registration from one association football club to another . In general , the players can only be transferred during a transfer window and according to the rules set by a governing body . Usually some sort of compensation is paid for the player 's rights , which is known as a transfer fee . When a player moves from one club to another , their old contract is terminated and they negotiate a new one with the club they are moving to , unlike in American , Canadian and Australian sports , where teams essentially trade existing player contracts . In some cases , however , transfers can function in a similar manner to player trades , as teams can offer another player on their squad as part of the compensation . According to FIFA , from January to September 2018 there were 15,049 international transfers of male players with fees totalling US $ 7.1 billion dollars , and 577 international transfers of female players for US $ 493,235 .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",
