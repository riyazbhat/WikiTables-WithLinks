Pat O'Malley and Verna Felton , and the director 's son , Bruce Reitherman , as Mowgli .

  "/wiki/Swahili_language": "Swahili , also known as Kiswahili ( translation : language of the Swahili people ) , is a Bantu language and the first language of the Swahili people . It is a lingua franca of the African Great Lakes region and other parts of eastern and south-eastern Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , some parts of Malawi , Somalia , Zambia , Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) . Comorian , spoken in the Comoros Islands , is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Swahili , though other authorities consider it a distinct language . The exact number of Swahili speakers , be it native or second-language speakers , is unknown and a matter of debate . Various estimates have been put forward and they vary widely , ranging from 100 million to 150 million . Swahili serves as a national language of the DRC , Kenya , Tanzania , and Uganda . Shikomor , the official language in Comoros and also spoken in Mayotte ( Shimaore ) , is related to Swahili . Swahili is also one of the working languages of the African Union and officially recognised as a lingua franca of the East African Community . In 2018 , South Africa legalized the teaching of Swahili in South African schools as an optional subject to begin in 2020 . A significant fraction of Swahili vocabulary derives from Arabic , in part conveyed by Arabic-speaking Muslim inhabitants . For example , the Swahili word for book is kitabu , traceable back to the Arabic word \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 kit\u0101b ( from the root K-T-B write ) . However , the Swahili plural form of this word ( books ) is vitabu , rather than the Arabic plural form \u0643\u062a\u0628 kutub , following the Bantu grammar in which ki- is reanalysed as a nominal class prefix , whose plural is vi- .",
