One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas .

Historically the dialects of the language group Min Chinese were most commonly spoken within the province , including the Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian . This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province 's name ( \u95a9 ) . Hakka Chinese is also spoken , by the Hakka people in Fujian . Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with Mandarin Chinese . Due to emigration , a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia and Philippines speak Southern Min ( or Hokkien ) .
