  "/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , often informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church , is a nontrinitarian , Christian restorationist church that considers itself to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ . The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City , Utah , in the United States , and has established congregations and built temples worldwide . According to the church , it has over 16 million members and 65,000 full-time volunteer missionaries . In 2012 , the National Council of Churches ranked the church as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States , with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018 . It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening . Adherents , often referred to as Latter-day Saints or , less formally , Mormons , view faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as fundamental principles of their religion . Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ , though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of mankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity . The church has an open canon which includes four scriptural texts : the Bible ( both Old and New Testaments ) , the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price . Other than the Bible , the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and exegesis about the Bible , texts described as lost parts of the Bible , and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets . Because of some of the doctrinal differences , Catholic , Orthodox , and several Protestant churches consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity . Under the doctrine of continuing revelation , Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day prophet , seer , and revelator and that Jesus Christ , under the direction of God the Father , leads the church by revealing his will to its president . Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives .",

  "/wiki/Social_entrepreneur": "Social entrepreneurship is an approach by start-up companies and entrepreneurs , in which they develop , fund and implement solutions to social , cultural , or environmental issues . This concept may be applied to a wide range of organizations , which vary in size , aims , and beliefs . For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like profit , revenues and increases in stock prices . Social entrepreneurs , however , are either non-profits , or they blend for-profit goals with generating a positive return to society . Therefore , they must use different metrics . Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social , cultural , and environmental goals often associated with the voluntary sector in areas such as poverty alleviation , health care and community development . At times , profit-making social enterprises may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in itself . For example , an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the homeless may operate a restaurant , both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless . In the 2010s , social entrepreneurship is facilitated by the use of the Internet , particularly social networking and social media websites . These websites enable social entrepreneurs to reach numerous people who are not geographically close yet who share the same goals and encourage them to collaborate online , learn about the issues , disseminate information about the group 's events and activities , and raise funds through crowdfunding .
