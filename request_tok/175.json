The town had a population of 39,277 in the 2011 census , making it the third largest settlement in Fife and the 18th most populous settlement in Scotland . The name Glenrothes comes from its historical link with the Earl of Rothes , who owned much of the land on which the new town has been built ; Glen ( Scottish for valley ) was added to the name to avoid confusion with Rothes in Moray and in recognition that the town lies in a river valley . The motto of Glenrothes is Ex terra vis , meaning From the earth strength , which dates back to the founding of the town . Planned in the late 1940s as one of Scotland 's first post-second world war new towns , its original purpose was to house miners who were to work at a newly established coal mine , the Rothes Colliery . After the mine closed , the town developed as an important industrial centre in Scotland 's Silicon Glen between 1961 and 2000 , with several major electronics and hi-tech companies setting up facilities in the town . The Glenrothes Development Corporation ( GDC ) , a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation , was established to develop , manage and promote the new town . The GDC , supported by the local authority , oversaw the governance of Glenrothes until the GDC was wound up in 1995 , after which all responsibility was transferred to Fife Council . Glenrothes is a major service centre and is the administrative capital of Fife , containing the headquarters of both Fife Council and Police Scotland Fife Division .

  "/wiki/Kirkcaldy": "Kirkcaldy ( /k\u0259r\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0di/ ( listen ) ; Scottish Gaelic : Cair Chaladain ) is a town and former royal burgh in Fife , on the east coast of Scotland . It is about 11.6 miles ( 19 km ) north of Edinburgh and 27.6 miles ( 44 km ) south-southwest of Dundee . The town had a recorded population of 49,460 in 2011 , making it Fife 's second-largest settlement and the 12th most populous settlement in Scotland . Kirkcaldy has long been nicknamed the Lang Toun ( listen ( help\u00b7info ) ; Scots for long town ) in reference to the early town 's 0.9-mile ( 1.4 km ) main street , as indicated on maps from the 16th and 17th centuries . The street would finally reach a length of nearly 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) , connecting the burgh to the neighbouring settlements of Linktown , Pathhead , Sinclairtown and Gallatown , which became part of the town in 1876 . The formerly separate burgh of Dysart was also later absorbed into Kirkcaldy in 1930 under an act of Parliament . The area around Kirkcaldy has been inhabited since the Bronze Age . The first document to refer to the town is from 1075 , when Malcolm III granted the settlement to the church of Dunfermline . David I later gave the burgh to Dunfermline Abbey , which had succeeded the church : a status which was officially recognised by Robert I in 1327 . The town only gained its independence from Abbey rule when it was created a royal burgh by Charles I in 1644 . From the early 16th century , the establishment of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town 's early role as an important trading port . The town also began to develop around the salt , coal mining and nail making industries.The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer , Michael Nairn .",

Alloa is south of the Ochil Hills , 5.5 miles ( 8.9 km ) east of Stirling and 7.9 miles ( 12.7 km ) north of Falkirk ; by water Alloa is 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Granton . The town , formerly a burgh of barony , is the administrative centre of Clackmannanshire Council . Historically , the economy relied heavily on trade between Glasgow and mainland Europe through its port . This became increasingly uncompetitive and the port stopped operating in 1970 . Any future marina project is likely to focus on tourism with Stirling or Granton rather than importing or exporting goods since downstream ports like Grangemouth can accommodate larger vessels . The local economy is now centred on retail and leisure since the closure of major industries ; only one brewer and one glassmaker survive today . Parochially , Alloa was linked with Tullibody .

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , Falkirk was at the centre of the iron and steel industry , underpinned by the Carron Company in nearby Carron . The company was responsible for making carronades for the Royal Navy and later manufactured pillar boxes . Within the last fifty years , heavy industry has waned , and the economy relies increasingly on retail and tourism .

Located on the River Forth , Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area , and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire . Proverbially it is the strategically important Gateway to the Highlands . It has been said that Stirling , like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together . Similarly he who holds Stirling , holds Scotland is often quoted . Stirling 's key position as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth made it a focal point for travel north or south . When Stirling was temporarily under Anglo-Saxon sway , according to a 9th-century legend , it was attacked by Danish invaders . The sound of a wolf roused a sentry , however , who alerted his garrison , which forced a Viking retreat . This led to the wolf being adopted as a symbol of the town as is shown on the 1511 Stirling Jug . The area is today known as Wolfcraig . Even today the wolf appears with a goshawk on the council 's coat of arms along with the recently chosen motto : Steadfast as the Rock .",

The town , with neighbouring Airdrie , is part of the Greater Glasgow urban area . While the earliest known settlement of the area dates back to the Stone Age era , the founding of the town can be traced to the 12th century , when a Royal Charter was granted to the monks of Newbattle Abbey by King Malcolm IV . Coatbridge , along with its neighbour Airdrie , forms the area known as the Monklands ( population approximately 90,000 including outlying settlements ) . In the last years of the 18th century , the area developed from a loose collection of hamlets into the town of Coatbridge . The town 's development and growth have been intimately connected with the technological advances of the Industrial Revolution , and in particular with the hot blast process . Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and was then described as 'the industrial heartland of Scotland ' and the 'Iron Burgh ' . Coatbridge also had a notorious reputation for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry . By the 1920s however , coal seams were exhausted and the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline . After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town .

Geographically , Cumbernauld sits between east and west , being on the Scottish watershed between the Forth and the Clyde ; however , it is culturally far more weighted towards Glasgow and the New Town 's planners thought to fill 80 % of its houses from Scotland 's largest city to reduce housing pressure there . Cumbernauld was marked by the Romans in antiquity . Traces of this are still visible today for example at Westerwood and , less conspicuously , north of the M80 where the legionaries surfaced what would later be called the Auld Cley Road . This is acknowledged in Cumbernauld Community Park , also site of Scotland 's only visible open-air Roman altar , in the shadow of the imposing Carrickstone Water Tower . For many years Cumbernauld was chiefly populated around what is now called The Village with the medieval castle a short walk away surrounded by its own park grounds . The castle frequently hosted visiting royalty and the grounds were famous for their white cattle which were hunted in the oak forest . The town began to spread as the weaving industry of the village was supplemented by mining and quarrying as travel across Scotland became easier due to the Forth and Clyde Canal and the railways being constructed . Cumbernauld railway station , though some distance from the village , improved communications with Glasgow , Falkirk and Stirling .
