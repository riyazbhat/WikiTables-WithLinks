  "/wiki/High_Wood": "The Attacks on High Wood near Bazentin le Petit in the Somme d\u00e9partement of northern France took place between the British Fourth Army and the German 1st Army during the Battle of the Somme . After the Battle of Bazentin Ridge on 14 July 1916 , High Wood lay undefended for most of the day but delays in communication and confusion caused by orders and counter-orders from British corps headquarters , which had overlapping responsibilities , led to the occupation of High Wood being forestalled by German reserves , which had moved forward to counter-attack British troops in the villages of Bazentin-le-Grand and Bazentin-le-Petit . Men from the 7th Division managed to occupy the southern half of the wood and two cavalry squadrons advanced on the east side to Wood Lane , which connected the wood to Longueval . On 15 July , the wood was evacuated by the survivors and the cavalry retired . The British and the Germans fought for control of the wood from 14 July to 15 September . Both sides had many casualties and chronic communication problems ; inclement weather grounded aircraft , obscured the view and slowed movement on the roads , which had been severely bombarded and turned to mud as soon as it rained . Trenches and shell holes filled with water , which made infantry movement exceedingly difficult and exhausted trench garrisons . The British and French found it impossible to arrange co-ordinated attacks and fought many small piecemeal actions , rather than general attacks until 15 September . British-French co-operation broke down again and the French did not attack on 15 September , when the British captured the wood during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette ( 15-22 September ) . The German defenders had great difficulty finding fresh troops for the Somme front , despite ending the Battle of Verdun ( 21 February - 20 December ) and had to send divisions to the Eastern Front and to Romania after it declared war on 27 August . Turnover of German divisions was high and many had to be withdrawn and replaced after fourteen days in the front line . The Germans lacked the resources to make many big organised counter-attacks and those at High Wood and the vicinity were often as costly and ineffective as corresponding British attacks .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

Initial Boer attacks were successful , and although British reinforcements later reversed these , the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare , until harsh British counter-measures brought the Boers to terms .

Staggered , the British brought in large numbers of soldiers and fought back . General Redvers Buller was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener . They relieved the three besieged cities , and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900 .

It was laid out on a portion of the farm Caroluspoort , was administered by a village management board from 1937 and attained municipal status in 1942 . Afrikaans for narrow pass , the name refers to a gap in the Carlton Hills 27 km to the north-west . It revolved principally around the railways and is still used as traction change-over facility from diesel to electric locomotives on the Noupoort-Bloemfontein line . It was serviced by Midlandia , a locomotive complex a few kilometres to the south of town , especially during the diesel era up to the late 1900s . Nowadays links up with the electric line to De Aar , part of the main artery for iron ore and manganese exports from the Northern Cape through Port Elizabeth Harbour on the south coast . Commercial activity in Noupoort is heavily dependent on railway activity . After a long period of increasingly less demand on the rail network , the town suffered from a drastic decline in local business leading to increasingly dire socioeconomic conditions for the local population . Poverty increased concomitantly with the decline in rail activity . This situation , however , was greatly remedied in 1992 with the establishment of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in the area by Pastor Sophos Nissiotis - the Noupoort Christian Care Centre .

South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

  "/wiki/New_Zealand_Wars": "The New Zealand Wars were a series of armed conflicts that took place in New Zealand from 1845 to 1872 between the Colonial government and allied M\u0101ori on one side and M\u0101ori and M\u0101ori-allied settlers on the other . They were previously commonly referred to as the Land Wars or the M\u0101ori Wars while M\u0101ori language names for the conflicts included Ng\u0101 pakanga o Aotearoa ( the great New Zealand wars ) and Te riri P\u0101keh\u0101 ( the white man 's anger ) . Historian James Belich popularised the name New Zealand Wars in the 1980s , although the term was first used by historian James Cowan in the 1920s . Though the wars were initially localised conflicts triggered by tensions over disputed land purchases , they escalated dramatically from 1860 as the government became convinced it was facing united M\u0101ori resistance to further land sales and a refusal to acknowledge Crown sovereignty . The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops to mount major campaigns to overpower the K\u012bngitanga ( M\u0101ori King ) movement and also acquire farming and residential land for British settlers . Later campaigns were aimed at quashing the so-called Hauhau movement , an extremist part of the Pai M\u0101rire religion , which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity . At the peak of hostilities in the 1860s , 18,000 British troops , supported by artillery , cavalry and local militia , battled about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors in what became a gross imbalance of manpower and weaponry . Although outnumbered , the M\u0101ori were able to withstand their enemy with techniques that included anti-artillery bunkers and the use of carefully placed p\u0101 , or fortified villages , that allowed them to block their enemy 's advance and often inflict heavy losses , yet quickly abandon their positions without significant loss . Guerrilla-style tactics were used by both sides in later campaigns , often fought in dense bush . Over the course of the Taranaki and Waikato campaigns , the lives of about 1,800 M\u0101ori and 800 Europeans were lost , and total M\u0101ori losses over the course of all the wars may have exceeded 2,100 . Violence over land ownership broke out first in the Wairau Valley in the South Island in June 1843 , but rising tensions in Taranaki eventually led to the involvement of British military forces at Waitara in March 1860 . The war between the government and K\u012bngitanga M\u0101ori spread to other areas of the North Island , with the biggest single campaign being the invasion of the Waikato in 1863-1864 , before hostilities concluded with the pursuits of Riwha T\u012btokowaru in Taranaki ( 1868-1869 ) and Rangatira ( chief ) Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki on the east coast ( 1868-1872 ) .",
