As one of the members of its predecessor , the German Workers ' Party , he was a close friend and early ally of Adolf Hitler and a co-founder of the Sturmabteilung ( SA , Storm Battalion ) , the Nazi Party 's militia , and later was its commander . By 1934 , the German Army feared the SA 's influence and Hitler had come to see R\u00f6hm as a potential rival , so he was executed during the Night of the Long Knives",
  "/wiki/Kurt_von_Schleicher": "Kurt Ferdinand Friedrich Hermann von Schleicher ( listen ( help\u00b7info ) ; 7 April 1882 - 30 June 1934 ) was a German general and the last Chancellor of Germany during the Weimar Republic . A rival for power with Adolf Hitler , Schleicher was murdered by Hitler 's SS during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 . Schleicher was born into a military family in Brandenburg an der Havel on 7 April 1882 . Entering the Prussian Army as a lieutenant in 1900 , he rose to become a General Staff officer in the Railway Department of the German General Staff and served in the General Staff of the Supreme Army Command during World War I. Schleicher served as liaison between the Army and the new Weimar Republic during the German Revolution of 1918-19 . An important player in the Reichswehr 's efforts to avoid the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles , Schleicher rose to power as head of the Reichswehr 's Armed Forces Department and close advisor to President Paul von Hindenburg from 1926 onward . Following the appointment of his mentor Wilhelm Groener as Minister of Defense in 1928 , Schleicher became head of the Defense Ministry 's Office of Ministerial Affairs ( Ministeramt ) in 1929 . In 1930 he was instrumental in the toppling of Hermann M\u00fcller 's government and the appointment of Heinrich Br\u00fcning as Chancellor . He enlisted the services of the SA as an auxiliary force for the Reichswehr from 1931 onward . Beginning in 1932 he served as Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Franz von Papen and was the prime mover behind the Preu\u00dfenschlag coup against the Social Democratic government of Prussia . Schleicher organized the downfall of Papen and succeeded him as Chancellor on 3 December . During his brief term , Schleicher negotiated with Gregor Strasser on a possible secession of the latter from the Nazi Party but their scheme failed . Schleicher attempted to tame Hitler into cooperating with his government by threatening him with an anti-Nazi alliance of parties , the so-called Querfront ( cross-front )",
  "/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives": "The Night of the Long Knives ( German : Nacht der langen Messer ( help\u00b7info ) ) , or the R\u00f6hm Purge , also called Operation Hummingbird ( German : Unternehmen Kolibri ) , was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from June 30 to July 2 , 1934 . Chancellor Adolf Hitler , urged on by Hermann G\u00f6ring and Heinrich Himmler , ordered a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of Ernst R\u00f6hm and the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) , the Nazis ' paramilitary organization . Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent coup by the SA under R\u00f6hm - the so-called R\u00f6hm Putsch . The primary instruments of Hitler 's action , which carried out most of the killings , were the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) paramilitary force under Himmler and its Security Service ( SD ) and Gestapo ( secret police ) under Reinhard Heydrich . G\u00f6ring 's personal police battalion also took part in the killings . Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA , the best-known being R\u00f6hm himself , the SA 's chief of staff and one of Hitler 's longtime supporters and allies . Leading members of the leftist-leaning Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party , including its figurehead , Gregor Strasser , were also killed , as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis , such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr , who had suppressed Hitler 's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 . The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics . Hitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power . He also wanted to conciliate leaders of the Reichswehr , the German military , who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival , in particular because of R\u00f6hm 's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership . Additionally , Hitler was uncomfortable with R\u00f6hm 's outspoken support for a second revolution to redistribute wealth . In R\u00f6hm 's view , President Hindenburg 's appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30 , 1933 had brought the Nazi Party to power , but had left unfulfilled the party 's larger goals",

  "/wiki/Avro_Lancaster": "The Avro Lancaster is a British Second World War heavy bomber . It was designed and manufactured by Avro as a contemporary of the Handley Page Halifax , both bombers having been developed to the same specification , as well as the Short Stirling , all three aircraft being four-engined heavy bombers adopted by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the same wartime era . The Lancaster has its origins in the twin-engine Avro Manchester which had been developed during the late 1930s in response to the Air Ministry Specification P.13/36 for a capable medium bomber for world-wide use . Originally developed as an evolution of the Manchester ( which had proved troublesome in service and was retired in 1942 ) , the Lancaster was designed by Roy Chadwick and powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlins and in one version , Bristol Hercules engines . It first saw service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum , it was the main aircraft for the night-time bombing campaigns that followed . As increasing numbers of the type were produced , it became the principal heavy bomber used by the RAF , the RCAF and squadrons from other Commonwealth and European countries serving within the RAF , overshadowing the Halifax and Stirling . A long , unobstructed bomb bay meant that the Lancaster could take the largest bombs used by the RAF , including the 4,000 lb ( 1,800 kg ) , 8,000 lb ( 3,600 kg ) and 12,000 lb ( 5,400 kg ) blockbusters , loads often supplemented with smaller bombs or incendiaries . The Lanc , as it was known colloquially , became one of the most heavily used of the Second World War night bombers , delivering 608,612 long tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties . The versatility of the Lancaster was such that it was chosen to equip 617 Squadron and was modified to carry the Upkeep Bouncing bomb designed by Barnes Wallis for Operation Chastise , the attack on German Ruhr valley dams . Although the Lancaster was primarily a night bomber , it excelled in many other roles , including daylight precision bombing , for which some Lancasters were adapted to carry the 12,000 lb ( 5,400 kg ) Tallboy and then the 22,000 lb ( 10,000 kg ) Grand Slam earthquake bombs ( also designed by Wallis ) . This was the largest payload of any bomber in the war . In 1943 , a Lancaster was converted to become an engine test bed for the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 turbojet",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Verri\u00e8res_Ridge": "The Battle of Verri\u00e8res Ridge was a series of engagements fought as part of the Battle of Normandy , in Calvados , during the Second World War . The main combatants were two Canadian infantry divisions - with additional support from the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade - against elements of three German SS Panzer divisions . The battle was part of the British and Canadian attempts to break out of Caen , and took place from 19 to 25 July 1944 , being part of both Operation Atlantic ( 18-21 July ) and Operation Spring ( 25-27 July ) . The immediate Allied objective was Verri\u00e8res Ridge , a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise . The ridge was occupied by battle-hardened German veterans , who had fallen back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position . Over the course of six days , substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge . Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine , as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations , resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain . From the perspective of the Canadian 1st Army , the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations - the most notable being a highly controversial attack by The Black Watch ( Royal Highland Regiment ) of Canada on 25 July , in which 315 of its 325 soldiers were killed , wounded or captured . This attack - the costliest single day for a Canadian battalion since the 1942 Dieppe Raid - has become one of the most contentious and critically analysed events in Canadian military history . While failing to achieve its original objective , an important strategic result of the Battle of Verri\u00e8res Ridge was to aid the overwhelmingly successful Operation Cobra , by tying down powerful German Panzer formations that might otherwise have been moved to counter-attack Cobra",
