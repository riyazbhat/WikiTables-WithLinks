  "/wiki/Intel_8088": "The Intel 8088 ( eighty-eighty-eight , also called iAPX 88 ) microprocessor is a variant of the Intel 8086 . Introduced on June 1 , 1979 , the 8088 had an eight-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 8086 . The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged , however . In fact , according to the Intel documentation , the 8086 and 8088 have the same execution unit ( EU ) - only the bus interface unit ( BIU ) is different . The original IBM PC was based on the 8088 , as were its clones",
  "/wiki/Floppy_disk": "A floppy disk , also known as a floppy , diskette , or simply disk , is a type of disk storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium , sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure lined with fabric that removes dust particles . Floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive ( FDD ) . Floppy disks , initially as 8-inch ( 203 mm ) media and later in 5 1\u20444-inch ( 133 mm ) and \u200b3 1\u20442 inch ( 90 mm ) sizes , were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s into the first years of the 21st century . By 2006 computers were rarely manufactured with installed floppy disk drives ; \u200b3 1\u20442-inch floppy disks can be used with an external USB floppy disk drive , but USB drives for \u200b5 1\u20444-inch , 8-inch , and non-standard diskettes are rare to non-existent . These formats are usually handled by older equipment . The prevalence of floppy disks in late 20th century culture was such that many electronic and software programs still use the floppy disks as save icons . While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses , especially with legacy industrial computer equipment , they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity and transfer speeds , such as USB flash drives , flash storage cards , optical discs and storage available through computer networks such as cloud storage",
  "/wiki/Compact_Cassette": "The Compact Cassette or Musicassette ( MC ) , also commonly called the cassette tape or simply tape or cassette , is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback . It was developed by Philips in Hasselt , Belgium , and introduced in September 1963 . Compact Cassettes come in two forms , either already containing content as a prerecorded cassette ( Musicassette ) , or as a fully recordable blank cassette . Both forms are reversible by the user . The compact cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines , but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications . Its uses ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers . The first cassette player ( although mono ) designed for use in car dashboards was introduced in 1968 . Between the early 1970s and continuing through the 1990s , the cassette was one of the two most common formats for prerecorded music , first alongside the LP record and later the compact disc ( CD ) . Compact Cassettes contain two miniature spools , between which the magnetically coated , polyester-type plastic film ( magnetic tape ) is passed and wound . These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell which is 4 by 2.5 by 0.5 inches ( 10 cm \u00d7 6.3 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm ) at its largest dimensions . The tape itself was commonly referred to as eighth-inch tape , supposedly 1\u20448 inch ( 3.17 mm ) wide , but it was slightly larger : 0.15 inches ( 3.81 mm ) . Two stereo pairs of tracks ( four total ) or two monaural audio tracks are available on the tape ; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second ( pair ) when moving in the other direction",
  "/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT": "The IBM Personal Computer XT , often shortened to the IBM XT , PC XT , or simply XT , is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive . It was released as IBM Machine Type number 5160 on March 8 , 1983 . Apart from the hard drive , it was essentially the same as the original PC , with only minor improvements . The XT was mainly intended as an enhanced IBM PC for business users . Later floppy-only models would effectively replace the original model 5150 PC . A corresponding 3270 PC featuring 3270 terminal emulation was released later in October 1983 . XT stands for eXtended Technology",
  "/wiki/PC-based_IBM-compatible_mainframes": "Since the rise of the personal computer in the 1980s , IBM and other vendors have created PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes which are compatible with the larger IBM mainframe computers . For a period of time PC-based mainframe-compatible systems had a lower price and did not require as much electricity or floor space . However , they sacrificed performance and were not as dependable as mainframe-class hardware . These products have been popular with mainframe developers , in education and training settings , for very small companies with non-critical processing , and in certain disaster relief roles ( such as field insurance adjustment systems for hurricane relief )",
  "/wiki/IBM_3270_PC": "The IBM 3270 PC ( IBM System Unit 5271 ) , released in October 1983 , is an IBM PC XT containing additional hardware which can emulate the behaviour of an IBM 3270 terminal . It can therefore be used both as a standalone computer , and as a terminal to a mainframe . IBM later released the 3270 AT ( IBM System Unit 5273 ) , which is a similar design based on the IBM PC AT . They also released high-end graphics versions of the 3270 PC in both XT and AT variants . The XT-based versions are called 3270 PC/G and 3270 PC/GX and they use a different System Unit 5371 , while their AT counterparts ( PC AT/G and PC AT/GX ) have System Unit 5373",
  "/wiki/3270_terminal": "The IBM 3270 is a class of block oriented computer terminals ( sometimes called display devices ) introduced by IBM in 1971 normally used to communicate with IBM mainframes . The 3270 was the successor to the IBM 2260 display terminal . Due to the text colour on the original models , these terminals are informally known as green screen terminals . Unlike a character-oriented terminal , the 3270 minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by transferring large blocks of data known as data streams , and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface , using coaxial cable . IBM no longer manufactures 3270 terminals , but the IBM 3270 protocol is still commonly used via 3270 terminal emulation or web interfaces to access mainframe-based applications , which are sometimes referred to as green screen applications",
  "/wiki/IBM_PCjr": "The IBM PCjr ( read PC junior ) is a home computer that was produced and marketed by IBM from March 1984 to May 1985 . The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful IBM Personal Computer ( PC ) , competing with other home computers such as the Apple II series and the Commodore 64 . It retains the IBM PC 's 8088 CPU and BIOS interface , but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC , ROM cartridge slots , joystick ports , and an infrared wireless keyboard . The PCjr supports expansion via sidecar modules , which are attached to the side of the unit . New software such as King 's Quest I showcased its PC gaming capabilities . Despite widespread anticipation , the PCjr 's launch was unsuccessful . IBM 's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning , with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr 's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II . It is only partially IBM compatible , so compatibility with existing PC software such as the killer app Lotus 1-2-3 was not guaranteed . The PCjr 's chiclet keyboard was widely criticized for its poor quality , with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing . The PCjr 's expandability was also limited , and it was initially offered with up to 128 KB of RAM only , insufficient for many IBM PC programs . The New York Times stated that the PCjr was incapable of serious business computing , which is similar to stating that a pickup is incapable of carrying a serious business payload , or that zirconium is not as bright as diamond - it misses the question entirely . The real question is , are there enough consumers who can be convinced that they need the amount and type of processing that the PCjr provided",
  "/wiki/Infrared": "Infrared radiation ( IR ) , sometimes called infrared light , is electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light . It is therefore generally invisible to the human eye , although IR at wavelengths up to 1050 nanometers ( nm ) s from specially pulsed lasers can be seen by humans under certain conditions . IR wavelengths extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers ( frequency 430 THz ) , to 1 millimeter ( 300 GHz ) . Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared . As with all EMR , IR carries radiant energy and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle , the photon . Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William Herschel , who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light , by means of its effect on a thermometer . Slightly more than half of the total energy from the Sun was eventually found to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared . The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on Earth 's climate . Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements . It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment , making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry . Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range . Infrared radiation is used in industrial , scientific , military , law enforcement , and medical applications",

  "/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/AT": "The IBM Personal Computer AT , more commonly known as the IBM AT and also sometimes called the PC AT or PC/AT , was IBM 's second-generation PC , designed around the 6 MHz Intel 80286 microprocessor and released in 1984 as System Unit 5170 . The name AT stood for Advanced Technology , and was chosen because the AT offered various technologies that were then new in personal computers ; one such advancement was that the 80286 processor supported protected mode . IBM later released an 8 MHz version of the AT",
  "/wiki/Intel_80286": "The Intel 80286 ( also marketed as the iAPX 286 and often called Intel 286 ) is a 16-bit microprocessor that was introduced on February 1 , 1982 . It was the first 8086-based CPU with separate , non-multiplexed address and data buses and also the first with memory management and wide protection abilities . The 80286 used approximately 134,000 transistors in its original nMOS ( HMOS ) incarnation and , just like the contemporary 80186 , it could correctly execute most software written for the earlier Intel 8086 and 8088 processors . The 80286 was employed for the IBM PC/AT , introduced in 1984 , and then widely used in most PC/AT compatible computers until the early 1990s",

  "/wiki/IBM_PC_Convertible": "The IBM PC Convertible is the first laptop computer released by IBM . Released on April 3 , 1986 , the Convertible was also the first IBM computer to use the 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk format which went on to become the industry standard . Like modern laptops , it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries . It was the follow-up to the IBM Portable and was model number 5140 . It was replaced in 1991 by the IBM PS/2 L40 SX , and in Japan by the IBM Personal System/55note , which was the predecessor to the ThinkPad",

  "/wiki/Laptop": "A laptop ( also laptop computer ) , often called a notebook , is a small , portable personal computer ( PC ) with a clamshell form factor , typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid . The clamshell is opened up to use the computer . Laptops are folded shut for transportation , and thus are suitable for mobile use . Its name comes from lap , as it was deemed to be placed on a person 's lap when being used . Although originally there was a distinction between laptops and notebooks ( the former being bigger and heavier than the latter ) , as of 2014 , there is often no longer any difference . Today , laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings , such as at work , in education , for playing games , Internet surfing , for personal multimedia , and general home computer use . Laptops combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer , including the display screen , small speakers , a keyboard , data storage device , optical disc drive , pointing devices ( such as a touchpad or trackpad ) , a processor , and memory into a single unit . Most modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones , while many also have touchscreens . Laptops can be powered either from an internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter . Hardware specifications , such as the processor speed and memory capacity , significantly vary between different types , makes , models and price points . Design elements , form factor and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on intended use . Examples of specialized models of laptops include rugged notebooks for use in construction or military applications , as well as low production cost laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) organization , which incorporate features like solar charging and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers",
  "/wiki/Wait_state": "A wait state is a delay experienced by a computer processor when accessing external memory or another device that is slow to respond . Computer microprocessors generally run much faster than the computer 's other subsystems , which hold the data the CPU reads and writes . Even memory , the fastest of these , can not supply data as fast as the CPU could process it . In an example from 2011 , typical PC processors like the Intel Core 2 and the AMD Athlon 64 X2 run with a clock of several GHz , which means that one clock cycle is less than 1 nanosecond ( typically about 0.3 ns to 0.5 ns on modern desktop CPUs ) , while main memory has a latency of about 15-30 ns . Some second-level CPU caches run slower than the processor core . When the processor needs to access external memory , it starts placing the address of the requested information on the address bus . It then must wait for the answer , that may come back tens if not hundreds of cycles later . Each of the cycles spent waiting is called a wait state . Wait states are a pure waste of a processor 's performance . Modern designs try to eliminate or hide them using a variety of techniques : CPU caches , instruction pipelines , instruction prefetch , branch prediction , simultaneous multithreading and others . No single technique is 100 % successful , but together can significantly reduce the problem",
  "/wiki/Motherboard": "A motherboard ( sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard , main circuit board , system board , baseboard , planar board or logic board , or colloquially , a mobo ) is the main printed circuit board ( PCB ) found in general purpose computers and other expandable systems . It holds , and allows , communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system , such as the central processing unit ( CPU ) and memory , and provides connectors for other peripherals . Unlike a backplane , a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor , the chipset 's input/output and memory controllers , interface connectors , and other components integrated for general purpose use and applications . Motherboard specifically refers to a PCB with expansion capability and as the name suggests , this board is often referred to as the mother of all components attached to it , which often include peripherals , interface cards , and daughtercards : sound cards , video cards , network cards , hard drives , or other forms of persistent storage ; TV tuner cards , cards providing extra USB or FireWire slots and a variety of other custom components . Similarly , the term mainboard is applied to devices with a single board and no additional expansions or capability , such as controlling boards in laser printers , televisions , washing machines , mobile phones and other embedded systems with limited expansion abilities"
