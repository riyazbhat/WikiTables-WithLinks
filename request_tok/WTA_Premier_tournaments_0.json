The name Wuhan came from the city 's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang , Hankou and Hanyang , which are collectively known as the Three Towns of Wuhan ( \u6b66\u6c49\u4e09\u9547 ) . It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain , on the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary , the Han River , and is known as Nine Provinces ' Thoroughfare ( \u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862 ) . Historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising , which led to the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China . Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) government led by Wang Jingwei . The city later served as the wartime capital of China in 1937 for ten months during the Second Sino-Japanese War . Wuhan today is considered the political , economic , financial , commercial , cultural and educational center of Central China . It is a major transportation hub , with dozens of railways , roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities . Because of its key role in domestic transportation , Wuhan is sometimes referred to as the Chicago of China by foreign sources . The Golden Waterway of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary , the Han River , traverse the urban area and divides Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang , Hankou and Hanyang . The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the city .",

The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010 , and , as of 2016 [ update ] , the city 's subway network is the busiest and longest in the world . Combining both modern and traditional architecture , Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world , with a rich history dating back three millennia . As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China , Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries , and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium AD . Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica notes that few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural center of an area as immense as China . With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital ."
