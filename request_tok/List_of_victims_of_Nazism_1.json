One of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust , she gained fame posthumously with the publication of The Diary of a Young Girl ( originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch ; English : The Secret Annex ) , in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 , during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II . It is one of the world 's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films . Born in Frankfurt , Germany , she lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam , Netherlands , having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the Nazis gained control over Germany . Born a German national , she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless . By May 1940 , the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands . As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942 , the Franks went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne 's father , Otto Frank , worked . From then until the family 's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944 , she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present , and wrote in it regularly . Following their arrest , the Franks were transported to concentration camps . In October or November 1944 , Anne and her sister , Margot , were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp , where they died ( probably of typhus ) a few months later . They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March , with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death , but research by the Anne Frank House in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February . Otto , the only survivor of the Franks , returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary , Miep Gies , and his efforts led to its publication in 1947",

Originally established as a prisoner of war camp , in 1943 , parts of it became a concentration camp . Initially this was an exchange camp , where Jewish hostages were held with the intention of exchanging them for German prisoners of war held overseas . The camp was later expanded to accommodate Jews from other concentration camps . After 1945 the name was applied to the displaced persons camp established nearby , but it is most commonly associated with the concentration camp . From 1941 to 1945 , almost 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war and a further 50,000 inmates died there . Overcrowding , lack of food and poor sanitary conditions caused outbreaks of typhus , tuberculosis , typhoid fever and dysentery , leading to the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the first few months of 1945 , shortly before and after the liberation . The camp was liberated on April 15 , 1945 , by the British 11th Armoured Division . The soldiers discovered approximately 60,000 prisoners inside , most of them half-starved and seriously ill , and another 13,000 corpses lying around the camp unburied . The horrors of the camp , documented on film and in pictures , made the name Belsen emblematic of Nazi crimes in general for public opinion in many countries in the immediate post-1945 period . Today , there is a memorial with an exhibition hall at the site",

She grew up in Leopoldstadt as the daughter of poor Jewish parents with her six siblings . She attended college , but after her father lost his job she was forced to leave school to work in a factory . In 1908 , she became a contributor to the socialist newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung and went on to co-found a socialist writers group , Vereinigung sozialistischer Schriftsteller , with Jewish socialist poet Josef Luitpold Stern , communist author , poet , essayist , and songwriter Fritz Br\u00fcgel , Jewish anarchist and socialist lyricist and poet Theodor Kramer , and early science fiction author Rudolf Brunngraber . Feldmann was able to develop stories from her articles into novels to reach a wider audience with her socialist message . She began working full-time for the Arbeiter-Zeitung in 1923 until the newspaper , along with other socialist and communist political activity , was forbidden by the austrofascist Fatherland Front Party in 1934 .

It was located in the forest next to the railway station of Sobib\u00f3r within the semi-colonial territory of the General Government in occupied Poland . Unlike many other Nazi concentration camps , Sobibor existed for the sole purpose of exterminating Jews . Most new arrivals were immediately sent to the gas chambers , with rare exceptions being made for those who were forced to serve as slave labourers who assisted in the operation of the camp . Some 200,000 to 250,000 people were murdered at Sobibor , making it the fourth deadliest extermination camp after Belzec , Treblinka , and Auschwitz . Sobibor is notable for the prisoner revolt which occurred on 14 October 1943 , an event which is often described as the most successful revolt ever to have taken place in a Nazi extermination camp . The plan for the revolt , which was developed by Alexander Pechersky and Leon Feldhendler , involved two phases . In the first phase , teams of prisoners were to assassinate all of the on-duty SS officers in discrete locations . In the second phase , all 600 prisoners would assemble for roll call and walk to freedom out the front gate . However , the revolt did not go as planned . The operation was discovered while several SS officers were still alive and prisoners ended up having to escape by climbing over barbed wire fences and running through a mine field under heavy machine gun fire . Even so , about 300 prisoners made it out of the camp , of whom roughly 60 survived to the end of the war",

  "/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp": "The Auschwitz concentration camp ( Konzentrationslager Auschwitz ) was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust . It consisted of Auschwitz I , the main camp ( Stammlager ) in O\u015bwi\u0119cim ; Auschwitz II-Birkenau , a concentration and extermination camp built with several gas chambers ; Auschwitz III-Monowitz , a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben ; and dozens of subcamps . The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers . Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz , 1.1 million died . The death toll includes 960,000 Jews ( 865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival ) , 74,000 non-Jewish Poles , 21,000 Roma , 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war , and up to 15,000 other Europeans . Those not gassed died of starvation , exhaustion , disease , individual executions , or beatings . Others were killed during medical experiments . At least 802 prisoners tried to escape , 144 successfully , and on 7 October 1944 two Sonderkommando units , consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers , launched an unsuccessful uprising",

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863 , it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East , where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception . It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents , known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds , spread throughout most of the world 's countries and territories . It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion , whose founder ( the B\u00e1b ) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad . In 1863 , after being banished from his native Iran , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h ( 1817-1892 ) announced that he was this prophet . He was further exiled , spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine . Following Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h 's death in 1892 , leadership of the religion fell to his son \u02bbAbdu ' l-Bah\u00e1 ( 1844-1921 ) , and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi ( 1897-1957 ) . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world annually elect local , regional , and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion , and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice , the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community , which sits in Haifa , Israel , near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths : God is considered single and all-powerful . However , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history ; Buddha , Jesus , and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h .

The camp operated between 23 July 1942 and 19 October 1943 as part of Operation Reinhard , the deadliest phase of the Final Solution . During this time , it is estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews were killed in its gas chambers , along with 2,000 Romani people . More Jews were killed at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz . Managed by the German SS and the Trawniki guards - enlisted voluntarily from among Soviet POWs to serve with the Germans - the camp consisted of two separate units . [ c ] Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp ( Arbeitslager ) whose prisoners worked in the gravel pit or irrigation area and in the forest , where they cut wood to fuel the cremation pits . Between 1941 and 1944 , more than half of its 20,000 inmates died from summary executions , hunger , disease and mistreatment . The second camp , Treblinka II , was an extermination camp ( Vernichtungslager ) , referred to euphemistically as the SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka by the Nazis . A small number of Jewish men who were not killed immediately upon arrival became its Jewish slave-labour units called Sonderkommandos , forced to bury the victims ' bodies in mass graves . These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres along with the bodies of new victims . Gassing operations at Treblinka II ended in October 1943 following a revolt by the Sonderkommandos in early August",

Theresienstadt served two main purposes : it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps , and a retirement settlement for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution . Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners , and the ghetto also served a propaganda role . Unlike other ghettos , the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant . The ghetto was established by a transport of Czech Jews in November 1941 . The first German and Austrian Jews arrived in June 1942 ; Dutch and Danish Jews came beginning in 1943 and prisoners of a wide variety of nationalities were sent to Theresienstadt in the last months of the war . About 33,000 people died at Theresienstadt , mostly from malnutrition and disease .

Known from his Romanian youth as a Symbolist poet and columnist , he alternated Neoromantic and Expressionist themes with echoes from Tudor Arghezi , and dedicated several poetic cycles to the rural life of his native Moldavia . Fondane , who was of Jewish Romanian extraction and a nephew of Jewish intellectuals Elias and Moses Schwartzfeld , participated in both minority secular Jewish culture and mainstream Romanian culture . During and after World War I , he was active as a cultural critic , avant-garde promoter and , with his brother-in-law Armand Pascal , manager of the theatrical troupe Insula . Fondane began a second career in 1923 , when he moved to Paris . Affiliated with Surrealism , but strongly opposed to its communist leanings , he moved on to become a figure in Jewish existentialism and a leading disciple of Lev Shestov . His critique of political dogma , rejection of rationalism , expectation of historical catastrophe and belief in the soteriological force of literature were outlined in his celebrated essays on Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud , as well as in his final works of poetry .

At its peak activity in 1944 , the Gross-Rosen complex had up to 100 subcamps located in eastern Germany , Czechoslovakia , and on the territory of occupied Poland .

  "/wiki/Dora_concentration_camp": "Mittelbau-Dora ( also Dora-Mittelbau and Nordhausen-Dora ) was a German Nazi concentration camp located near Nordhausen in Thuringia , Germany . It was established in late summer 1943 as a subcamp of Buchenwald concentration camp , supplying Slavic slave labour from many Eastern countries occupied by Germany ( including evacuated survivors of eastern extermination camps ) , for extending the nearby tunnels in the Kohnstein and for manufacturing the V-2 rocket and the V-1 flying bomb . In the summer of 1944 , Mittelbau became an independent concentration camp with numerous subcamps of its own . In 1945 , most of the surviving inmates were evacuated by the SS . On 11 April 1945 , US troops freed the remaining prisoners . The racial ideology of Nazi Germany held that Slavic people were sub-human . Accordingly , the inmates at Dora-Mittelbau were treated in a brutal and inhumane manner , working 14-hour days and being denied access to basic hygiene , beds , and adequate rations . Around one in three of the roughly 60,000 prisoners who were sent to Dora-Mittelbau died . Today , the site hosts a memorial and museum"
