  "/wiki/Grappa": "Grappa is an alcoholic beverage : a fragrant , grape-based pomace brandy of Italian origin that contains 35 to 60 percent alcohol by volume ( 70 to 120 US proof ) . The flavor of grappa , like that of wine , depends on the type and quality of the grapes used , as well as the specifics of the distillation process . Grappa is made by distilling the skins , pulp , seeds , and stems ( i.e. , the pomace ) left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes . It was originally made to prevent waste by using these leftovers . A similar drink , known as acquavite d'uva , is made by distilling whole must . Grappa is now a protected name in the European Union . To be called grappa , the following criteria must be met : Criterion 2 rules out the direct fermentation of pure grape juice , which is the method used to produce brandy . Criterion 3 has two important implications . First , the distillation must occur on solids . Thus , it is carried out not with a direct flame but with a bain-marie or steam distillation ; otherwise , the pomace may burn . Second , the woody parts of the grapes ( the stems and seeds ) are co-fermented with the sugar-rich juice ; this produces a very small amount of methanol , which is much more toxic than ethanol . Unlike in the similar process of making red wine , in grappa the methanol must be carefully removed during distillation .",

  "/wiki/Elk": "The elk or wapiti ( Cervus canadensis ) is one of the largest species within the deer family , Cervidae , and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in North America and Northeast Asia . This animal should not be confused with the still larger Alces alces , known as the moose in America , but as the elk in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia . Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat , feeding on grasses , plants , leaves , and bark . Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year . Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut , including posturing , antler wrestling ( sparring ) , and bugling , a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females . Although they are native to North America and eastern Asia , they have adapted well to countries in which they have been introduced , including Argentina and New Zealand . Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced . Elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases , some of which can be transmitted to livestock . Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations , largely by vaccination , have had mixed success . Some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force . In parts of Asia , antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines . Elk are hunted as a game species .",
