  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",
  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40 % of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25 % of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth .",
  "/wiki/Metal": "A metal ( from Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd m\u00e9tallon , mine , quarry , metal ) is a material that , when freshly prepared , polished , or fractured , shows a lustrous appearance , and conducts electricity and heat relatively well . Metals are typically malleable ( they can be hammered into thin sheets ) or ductile ( can be drawn into wires ) . A metal may be a chemical element such as iron ; an alloy such as stainless steel ; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride . In physics , a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero . Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures . For example , the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure . Equally , some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals . Sodium , for example , becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure . In chemistry , two elements that would otherwise qualify ( in physics ) as brittle metals - arsenic and antimony - are commonly instead recognised as metalloids , on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry . Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals ( or are likely to be such ) . The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals , nonmetals , and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved . In astrophysics the term metal is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two , hydrogen and helium , and not just traditional metals .",

  "/wiki/Information_technology": "Information technology ( IT ) is the use of computers to store , retrieve , transmit , and manipulate data or information . IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies . IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology ( ICT ) . An information technology system ( IT system ) is generally an information system , a communications system or , more specifically speaking , a computer system - including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users . Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology ( IT ) . Their definition consists of three categories : techniques for processing , the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs . The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks , but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones . Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology , including computer hardware , software , electronics , semiconductors , internet , telecom equipment , and e-commerce . [ a ] Based on the storage and processing technologies employed , it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development : pre-mechanical ( 3000 BC - 1450 AD ) , mechanical ( 1450-1840 ) , electromechanical ( 1840-1940 ) , and electronic ( 1940-present ) . This article focuses on the most recent period ( electronic ) .",

The term ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system . There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling , signal distribution , and management . ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device , encompassing radio , television , cell phones , computer and network hardware , satellite systems and so on , as well as the various services and appliance with them such as video conferencing and distance learning . [ citation needed ] ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving . It covers any product that will store , retrieve , manipulate , transmit , or receive information electronically in a digital form ( e.g. , personal computers , digital television , email , or robots ) . Theoretical differences between interpersonal-communication technologies and mass-communication technologies have been identified by the philosopher Piyush Mathur .

  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry .",

  "/wiki/Leisure": "Leisure has often been defined as a quality of experience or as free time . Free time is time spent away from business , work , job hunting , domestic chores , and education , as well as necessary activities such as eating and sleeping . Situationist International proposes that leisure does not evolve from free time , and free-time is an illusory concept that is rarely fully free ; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as leisure . Certainly most people 's leisure activities are not a completely free choice and may be constrained by social pressures , e.g . people may be coerced into spending time gardening by the need to keep up with the standard of neighbouring gardens or go to a party because of social pressures . Leisure as experience usually emphasizes dimensions of perceived freedom and choice . It is done for its own sake , for the quality of experience and involvement . Other classic definitions include Thorsten Veblen 's ( 1899 ) of nonproductive consumption of time . Different disciplines have definitions reflecting their common issues : for example , sociology on social forces and contexts and psychology as mental and emotional states and conditions . From a research perspective , these approaches have an advantage of being quantifiable and comparable over time and place . Leisure studies and sociology of leisure are the academic disciplines concerned with the study and analysis of leisure . Research has shown that practicing creative leisure activities is interrelated with the emotional creativity .",

  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80 % of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80 % or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name .",
  "/wiki/Diamond_mining": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) .",
  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction . A relatively rare element , gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history .",

  "/wiki/Logistics": "Logistics is generally the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation . In a general business sense , logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet requirements of customers or corporations . The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials , equipment , and supplies , as well as food and other consumable items . The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow , materials handling , production , packaging , inventory , transportation , warehousing , and often security . In military science , logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy , since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless . Military logistics was already practiced in the ancient world and as modern military have a significant need for logistics solutions , advanced implementations have been developed . In military logistics , logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed . Logistics management is the part of supply chain management and supply chain engineering that plans , implements , and controls the efficient , effective forward , and reverse flow and storage of goods , services , and related information between point of origin and point of consumption to meet customer 's requirements . The complexity of logistics can be modeled , analyzed , visualized , and optimized by dedicated simulation software . The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in all logistics fields . A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician .",
  "/wiki/Transport": "Transport or transportation is the movement of humans , animals and goods from one location to another . In other words , the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a point B. Modes of transport include air , land ( rail and road ) , water , cable , pipeline and space . The field can be divided into infrastructure , vehicles and operations . Transport enables trade between people , which is essential for the development of civilizations . Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations , including roads , railways , airways , waterways , canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports , railway stations , bus stations , warehouses , trucking terminals , refueling depots ( including fueling docks and fuel stations ) and seaports . Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance . Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles , bicycles , buses , trains , trucks , helicopters , watercraft , spacecraft and aircraft . Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated , and the procedures set for this purpose , including financing , legalities , and policies . In the transport industry , operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private , depending on the country and mode . Passenger transport may be public , where operators provide scheduled services , or private . Freight transport has become focused on containerization , although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items . Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization , but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land .",

  "/wiki/Construction": "Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . Construction starts with planning , design , and financing ; it continues until the project is built and ready for use . Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . A project manager normally manages the budget on the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it . Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements , environmental impact of the job , scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding . Large construction projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects .",
  "/wiki/Manufacturing": "Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines , tools , chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry . The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design , in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale . Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products ( such as aircraft , household appliances , furniture , sports equipment or automobiles ) , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers ( usually through wholesalers , who in turn sell to retailers , who then sell them to individual customers ) . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product . The manufacturing process begins with the product design , and materials specification from which the product is made . These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part . Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product 's components . Some industries , such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead . The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design . Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation , General Electric , Procter & Gamble , General Dynamics , Boeing , Pfizer , and Precision Castparts . Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group , Siemens , FCA and Michelin . Examples in Asia include Toyota , Yamaha , Panasonic , LG , Samsung and Tata Motors .",

In general , it has also been defined as the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable , sustain , or enhance societal living conditions .",
  "/wiki/Property": "Property in the abstract is what belongs to or with something , whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing . In the context of this article , it is one or more components ( rather than attributes ) , whether physical or incorporeal , of a person 's estate ; or so belonging to , as in being owned by , a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society . Depending on the nature of the property , an owner of property has the right to consume , alter , share , redefine , rent , mortgage , pawn , sell , exchange , transfer , give away or destroy it , or to exclude others from doing these things , as well as to perhaps abandon it ; whereas regardless of the nature of the property , the owner thereof has the right to properly use it ( as a durable , mean or factor , or whatever ) , or at the very least exclusively keep it . In economics and political economy , there are three broad forms of property : private property , public property , and collective property ( also called cooperative property ) . Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways , whether simply or complexly , whether equally or unequally . However , there is an expectation that each party 's will ( rather discretion ) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional , [ citation needed ] so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent . The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous , or alternately every given one of them , when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists , may expect his , her , its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute . The Restatement ( First ) of Property defines property as anything , tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing . This mediating relationship between individual , property and state is called a property regime . In sociology and anthropology , property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object , in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object . The distinction between collective property and private property is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object . Important widely recognized types of property include real property ( the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land ) , personal property ( physical possessions belonging to a person ) , private property ( property owned by legal persons , business entities or individual natural persons ) , public property ( state owned or publicly owned and available possessions ) and intellectual property ( exclusive rights over artistic creations , inventions , etc .",
  "/wiki/Metallurgy": "Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements , their inter-metallic compounds , and their mixtures , which are called alloys . Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals . That is , the way in which science is applied to the production of metals , and the engineering of metal components used in products for both consumers and manufacturers . Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking . Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement . A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a Metallurgist . The science of metallurgy is subdivided into two broad categories : chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy . Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals , and the chemical performance of metals . Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing , the extraction of metals , thermodynamics , electrochemistry , and chemical degradation ( corrosion ) . In contrast , physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals , the physical properties of metals , and the physical performance of metals . Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography , material characterization , mechanical metallurgy , phase transformations , and failure mechanisms . Historically , metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals ."
