  "/wiki/First_class_cricket": "First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest-standard international or domestic matches in the sport of cricket . A first-class match is of three or more days ' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams . Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each although , in practice , a team might play only one innings or none at all . First-class cricket ( which for this purpose includes all important matches played before 1895 ) , along with historical single-wicket and the modern limited-overs forms of List A and Twenty20 , is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket . The origin of the term first-class cricket is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status , effective in 1895 , following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894 . Subsequently , at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference ( ICC ) in May 1947 , it was formally defined on a global basis . A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively . This has left historians , and especially statisticians , with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches , especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain . The solution put forward by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians ( ACS ) is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as important matches . Test cricket , the highest standard of cricket , is statistically a form of first-class cricket , though the term first-class is mainly used to refer to domestic competition . A player 's first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches .",
  "/wiki/Clive_Lloyd": "Sir Clive Hubert Lloyd ( born 31 August 1944 ) is a former Guyanese cricketer who played for the West Indies cricket team . In 1971 he was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year . He captained the West Indies between 1974 and 1985 and oversaw their rise to become the dominant Test-playing nation , a position that was only relinquished in the latter half of the 1990s . He is one of the most successful Test captains of all time : during his captaincy the side had a run of 27 matches without defeat , which included 11 wins in succession ( Viv Richards acted as captain for one of the 27 matches , against Australia at Port of Spain in 1983-84 ) . He was the first West Indian player to earn 100 international caps . Lloyd captained the West Indies in three World Cups , winning in 1975 ( with Lloyd scoring a century ) and 1979 while losing the 1983 final to India . Lloyd was a tall , powerful middle-order batsman and occasional medium-pace bowler . In his youth he was also a strong cover point fielder . He wore his famous glasses as a result of being poked in the eye with a ruler .

  "/wiki/Captain_(cricket)": "The captain of a cricket team , often referred to as the skipper , is the appointed leader , having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players . As in other sports , the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills , and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team , as the captain often has a say in team selection . Before the game the captains toss for innings . During the match the captain decides the team 's batting order , who will bowl each over , and where each fielder will be positioned . While the captain has the final say , decisions are often collaborative . A captain 's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics , and shrewdness in the field , may contribute significantly to the team 's success . Due to the smaller coaching/management role played out by support staff , as well as the need for greater on-field decision-making , the captain of a cricket team typically shoulders more responsibility for results than team captains in other sports .",
  "/wiki/Fast_bowling": "Pace bowler ( also referred to as fast bowling ) is one of two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket , the other being spin bowling . Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as fast bowlers , quicks , or pacemen . They can also be referred to as a seam bowler , a swing bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it ' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries . Strictly speaking , a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace , though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days . The aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake . The bowler achieves this by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable , linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it . For deviation caused by the ball 's stitching ( the seam ) , the ball bounces off the pitch and deflects either away from the batsman 's body , or inwards towards them . Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way . To 'bowl swing ' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air . Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation , body position at the point of release , asymmetric ball polishing , and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball . The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement ' can make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately . Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory , the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly , or at all .",

ODIs were infrequent in Fredericks ' time , and consequently he only appeared in 12 matches , making 311 runs . At the first-class level , he represented Glamorgan Cricket Club in English domestic cricket and British Guiana and Guyana . He had a number of opening partners in the Test team before establishing a successful partnership with Gordon Greenidge in the mid-1970s . He was an aggressive batsman who liked to counterattack fast bowlers , but also was capable as a traditional accumulator of runs . His highest Test score was 169 against Australia at Perth in 1975-76 . After Australia had been dismissed early on the second day , in 90 minutes batting before lunch the West Indies scored 130 for 1 off 14 eight-ball overs , and after lunch Fredericks reached his century off only 71 balls , at the time the quickest ever .

  "/wiki/Chinaman_(cricket)": "Left-arm unorthodox spin , also known as slow left-arm wrist-spin bowling or chinaman , is a type of left arm wrist leg spin bowling in the sport of cricket . Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use wrist spin to spin the ball , and make it deviate , or turn from left to right after pitching . The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler ; however , the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist . Some left-arm unorthodox bowlers also bowl the equivalent of a googly , ( or wrong'un ) , which turns from right to left on the pitch . The ball turns away from the right-handed batsman , as if the bowler were an orthodox left-arm spinner . In cricketing parlance , the word chinaman was sometimes used to describe the stock delivery of a left-arm wrist-spinner , or unorthodox spin bowler ( though some reserve it for the googly delivery . The origin of the term is uncertain . One version relates to a Test match played between England and the West Indies at Old Trafford in 1933 . Ellis Puss Achong , a player of Chinese origin , was a left-arm orthodox spinner , playing for the West Indies . He had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump . As he walked back to the pavilion , Robins reportedly said to the umpire , fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman ! , leading to the popularity of the term in England , and subsequently , in the rest of the world . However , it has been suggested that the term originated earlier than this , in Yorkshire .",

In 2009 , Gibbs was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame .",
  "/wiki/Offbreak": "An off break is the type of delivery in the sport of cricket . It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler . Off breaks are known as off spinners . An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers . As the ball is released , the fingers roll down the right side of the ball ( for a right-handed bowler ) , giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind . When the ball bounces on the pitch , the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler 's perspective , this is to the left from the batsman 's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman . The ball spins away from the off side . An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks , varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries . Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play . This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman 's body , meaning the batsman 's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge . This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break , but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket , assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump . A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling , because the ball moves away from his body .",
