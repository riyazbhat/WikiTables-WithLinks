The first play at the theatre was a hit musical called The Beauty of Bath co-written by Hicks . Another big success was A Waltz Dream in 1908 . In 1909 , the American impresario Charles Frohman became manager of the theatre and renamed the house the Globe Theatre - a name that it retained for 85 years . Call It a Day opened in 1935 and ran for 509 performances , a long run for the slow inter-war years . There 's a Girl in My Soup , opening in 1966 , ran for almost three years , a record for the theatre that was not surpassed until Daisy Pulls It Off opened in April 1983 to run for 1,180 performances .

  "/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre": "The Royal National Theatre in London , commonly known as the National Theatre ( NT ) , is one of the United Kingdom 's three most prominent publicly funded performing arts venues , alongside the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Opera House . Internationally , it is known as the National Theatre of Great Britain . From its foundation in 1963 until 1976 , the company was based at The Old Vic theatre in Waterloo . The current building is located next to the Thames in the South Bank area of central London . In addition to performances at the National Theatre building , the National Theatre tours productions at theatres across the United Kingdom . Permission to add the Royal prefix to the name of the theatre was given in 1988 , but the full title is rarely used . The theatre presents a varied programme , including Shakespeare , other international classic drama , and new plays by contemporary playwrights . Each auditorium in the theatre can run up to three shows in repertoire , thus further widening the number of plays which can be put on during any one season . In June 2009 , the theatre began National Theatre Live ( NT Live ) , a programme of simulcasts of live productions to cinemas , first in the United Kingdom and then internationally . The programme began with a production of Ph\u00e8dre , starring Helen Mirren , which was screened live in 70 cinemas across the UK . NT Live productions have since been broadcast to over 2,500 venues in 60 countries around the world . The NT had an annual turnover of approximately \u00a3105 million in 2015-16 , of which earned income made up 75 % ( 58 % from ticket sales , 5 % from NT Live and Digital , and 12 % from commercial revenue such as in the restaurants , bookshops , etc . ) .",
  "/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet": "Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families . It was among Shakespeare 's most popular plays during his lifetime and along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays . Today , the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers . Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity . The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567 . Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters , particularly Mercutio and Paris . Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 , the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 . The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality , however , and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare 's original . Shakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure ( especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story ) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill . The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters , sometimes changing the form as the character develops . Romeo , for example , grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play . Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage , film , musical , and opera venues .",
  "/wiki/Romeo": "Romeo Montague is the main protagonist of William Shakespeare 's tragedy , The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet . The son of Lord Montague and his wife , Lady Montague , he secretly loves and marries Juliet , a member of the rival House of Capulet , through a priest named Friar Laurence . Forced into exile after slaying Juliet 's cousin , Tybalt , in a duel , Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet 's death . The character 's origins can be traced as far back as Pyramus , who appears in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , but the first modern incarnation of Romeo is Mariotto in the 33rd of Masuccio Salernitano 's Il Novellino ( 1476 ) . This story was reworked in 1524 by Luigi da Porto as Giulietta e Romeo ( published posthumously in 1531 ) . Da Porto named the character Romeo Montecchi and his storyline is near-identical to Shakespeare 's adaptation . Since no 16th-century direct English translation of Giulietta e Romeo is known , Shakespeare 's main source is thought to be Arthur Brooke 's English verse translation of a French translation of a 1554 adaptation by Matteo Bandello . Although both Salernitano and da Porto claimed that their stories had historical basis , there is little evidence that this is the case . Romeo , an only child like Juliet , is one of the most important characters of the play , and has a consistent presence throughout it . His role as an idealistic lover has led the word Romeo to become a synonym for a passionate male lover in various languages . Although often treated as such , it is not clear that Montague is a surname in the modern sense .",

  "/wiki/A_View_from_the_Bridge": "A View from the Bridge is a play by American playwright Arthur Miller . It was first staged on September 29 , 1955 , as a one-act verse drama with A Memory of Two Mondays at the Coronet Theatre on Broadway . The run was unsuccessful , and Miller subsequently revised the play to contain two acts ; this version is the one with which audiences are most familiar . The two-act version premiered in the New Watergate theatre club in London 's West End under the direction of Peter Brook on October 11 , 1956 . The play is set in 1950s America , in an Italian-American neighborhood near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York . It employs a chorus and narrator in the character of Alfieri . Eddie , the tragic protagonist , has an improper love of , and almost obsession with , Catherine , his wife Beatrice 's orphaned niece , so he does not approve of her courtship of Beatrice 's cousin Rodolfo . Miller 's interest in writing about the world of the New York docks originated with an unproduced screenplay that he developed with Elia Kazan in the early 1950s ( titled The Hook ) that addressed corruption on the Brooklyn docks . Kazan later directed On the Waterfront , which dealt with the same subject . Miller said that he heard the basic account that developed into the plot of A View from the Bridge from a lawyer who worked with longshoremen , who related it to him as a true story .",

Written in Danish - the common written language of Denmark and Norway in Ibsen 's lifetime - it is one of the most widely performed Norwegian plays . Ibsen believed Per Gynt , the Norwegian fairy tale on which the play is loosely based , to be rooted in fact , and several of the characters are modelled after Ibsen 's own family , notably his parents Knud Ibsen and Marichen Altenburg . He was also generally inspired by Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen 's collection of Norwegian fairy tales , published in 1845 ( Huldre-Eventyr og Folkesagn ) . Peer Gynt chronicles the journey of its titular character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert . According to Klaus Van Den Berg , its origins are romantic , but the play also anticipates the fragmentations of emerging modernism and the cinematic script blends poetry with social satire and realistic scenes with surreal ones . Peer Gynt has also been described as the story of a life based on procrastination and avoidance . The play was written in Italy and a first edition of 1,250 copies was published on 14 November 1867 by the Danish publisher Gyldendal in Copenhagen . Although the first edition swiftly sold out , a reprint of two thousand copies , which followed after only fourteen days , did n't sell out until seven years later . While Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson admired the play 's satire on Norwegian egotism , narrowness , and self-sufficiency and described it as magnificent , Hans Christian Andersen , Georg Brandes and Clemens Petersen all joined the widespread hostility , Petersen writing that the play was not poetry . Enraged by Petersen 's criticisms in particular , Ibsen defended his work by arguing that it is poetry ; and if it is n't , it will become such .

  "/wiki/Look_Back_in_Anger": "Look Back in Anger ( 1956 ) is a realist play written by John Osborne . It focuses on the life and marital struggles of an intelligent and educated but disaffected young man of working-class origin , Jimmy Porter , and his equally competent yet impassive upper-middle-class wife Alison . The supporting characters include Cliff Lewis , an amiable Welsh lodger who attempts to keep the peace ; and Helena Charles , Alison 's snobbish friend . Osborne drew inspiration from his personal life and failing marriage with Pamela Lane while writing Look Back in Anger , which was his first successful outing as a playwright . The play spawned the term angry young men to describe Osborne and those of his generation who employed the harshness of realism in the theatre in contrast to the more escapist theatre that characterised the previous generation . This harsh realism has led to Look Back in Anger being considered one of the first examples of kitchen sink drama in theatre . The play was received favorably in the theatre community becoming an enormous commercial success , transferring to the West End and Broadway , and even touring to Moscow . It is credited with turning Osborne from a struggling playwright into a wealthy and famous personality , and also won him the Evening Standard Drama Award as the most promising playwright of 1956 .

  "/wiki/The_Seagull": "The Seagull ( Russian : \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 , romanized : Chayka ) is a play by Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov , written in 1895 and first produced in 1896 . The Seagull is generally considered to be the first of his four major plays . It dramatises the romantic and artistic conflicts between four characters : the famous middlebrow story writer Boris Trigorin , the ingenue Nina , the fading actress Irina Arkadina , and her son the symbolist playwright Konstantin Tr\u00e9plev . Though the character of Trigorin is considered Chekhov 's greatest male role [ citation needed ] , like Chekhov 's other full-length plays , The Seagull relies upon an ensemble cast of diverse , fully developed characters . In contrast to the melodrama of mainstream 19th-century theatre , lurid actions ( such as Konstantin 's suicide attempts ) are not shown onstage . Characters tend to speak in ways that skirt around issues rather than addressing them directly ; in other words , their lines are full of what is known in dramatic practice as subtext . The opening night of the first production was a famous failure . Vera Komissarzhevskaya , playing Nina , was so intimidated by the hostility of the audience that she lost her voice . Chekhov left the audience and spent the last two acts behind the scenes . When supporters wrote to him that the production later became a success , he assumed that they were merely trying to be kind . When Konstantin Stanislavski , the seminal Russian theatre practitioner of the time , directed it in 1898 for his Moscow Art Theatre , the play was a triumph . Stanislavski 's production of The Seagull became one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama .",

The architect was George Dance the Younger , with John Palmer carrying out much of the work . It opened with a performance of Shakespeare 's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan , William Macready and Edmund Kean . A major fire in 1862 destroyed the interior of the building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by Charles J. Phipps , which included the construction of the current entrance . Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892 ; more extensive building work , including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting , followed in 1902 . Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt , the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell , the theatre was rarely very profitable . During World War II Donald Wolfit , Irene Vanbrugh , John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike appeared , with shows including No\u00ebl Coward 's Private Lives and Blyth Spirit , a performance by Ballet Rambert and light entertainment such as Charley 's Aunt , but audiences declined .
