  "/wiki/Gelling_agent": "A thickening agent or thickener is a substance which can increase the viscosity of a liquid without substantially changing its other properties . Edible thickeners are commonly used to thicken sauces , soups , and puddings without altering their taste ; thickeners are also used in paints , inks , explosives , and cosmetics . Thickeners may also improve the suspension of other ingredients or emulsions which increases the stability of the product . Thickening agents are often regulated as food additives and as cosmetics and personal hygiene product ingredients . Some thickening agents are gelling agents ( gellants ) , forming a gel , dissolving in the liquid phase as a colloid mixture that forms a weakly cohesive internal structure . Others act as mechanical thixotropic additives with discrete particles adhering or interlocking to resist strain . Thickening agents can also be used when a medical condition such as dysphagia causes difficulty in swallowing . Thickened liquids play a vital role in reducing risk of aspiration for dysphagia patients",
