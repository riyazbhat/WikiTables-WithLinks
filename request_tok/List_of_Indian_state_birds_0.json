  "/wiki/Binomial_name": "Binomial nomenclature ( two-term naming system ) , also called binominal nomenclature ( two-name naming system ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . Such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just binomial ) , a binomen , binominal name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name - the generic name - identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part - the specific name or specific epithet - identifies the species within the genus . For example , humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . Tyrannosaurus rex is probably the most widely known binomial . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753 . But Gaspard Bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici ( English , Illustrated exposition of plants ) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus . The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICNafp ) . Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules . In modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . Similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii",

The adult male sports a red and black neck ring , and the hen and immature birds of both sexes either show no neck rings , or display shadow-like pale to dark grey neck rings . Both sexes have a distinctive green colour in the wild , and captive bred ringnecks have multiple colour mutations including blue , violet and yellow . Rose-ringed parakeets measure on average 40 cm ( 16 in ) in length , including the tail feathers , a large portion of their total length . Their average single-wing length is about 15 to 17.5 cm ( 5.9 to 6.9 in ) . In the wild , this is a noisy species with an unmistakable squawking call . Captive individuals can be taught to speak . They are a herbivorous and non-migratory species . One of the few parrot species that have successfully adapted to living in disturbed habitats , it has withstood the onslaught of urbanisation and deforestation . As a popular pet species , escaped birds have colonised a number of cities around the world , including Northern and Western Europe",

It feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds , but it is an opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods . Its predators include domestic cats , hawks , owls , and many other predatory birds and mammals . Because of its numbers , ubiquity , and association with human settlements , the house sparrow is culturally prominent . It is extensively , and usually unsuccessfully , persecuted as an agricultural pest . It has also often been kept as a pet , as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust , sexual potency , commonness , and vulgarity",

  "/wiki/Northern_goshawk": "The northern goshawk ( /\u02c8\u0261\u0252s\u02cch\u0254\u02d0k/ ; Accipiter gentilis ) is a medium-large raptor in the family Accipitridae , which also includes other extant diurnal raptors , such as eagles , buzzards and harriers . As a species in the genus Accipiter , the goshawk is often considered a true hawk . The scientific name is Latin ; Accipiter is hawk , from accipere , to grasp , and gentilis is noble or gentle because in the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry . This species was first described under its current scientific name by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 . It is a widespread species that inhabits many of the temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere . The northern goshawk is the only species in the genus Accipiter found in both Eurasia and North America . It may have the second widest distribution of any true member of the family Accipitridae , behind arguably only the golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos ) , which has a broader range to the south of Asia than the goshawk . The only other acciptrid species to also range in both North America and Eurasia according to current opinion , is the more Arctic-restricted rough-legged buzzard ( Buteo lagopus ) . Except in a small portion of southern Asia , it is the only species of goshawk in its range and it is thus often referred to , both officially and unofficially , as simply the goshawk . It is mainly resident , but birds from colder regions migrate south for the winter . In North America , migratory goshawks are often seen migrating south along mountain ridge tops at nearly any time of the fall depending on latitude"
