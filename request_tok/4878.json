  "/wiki/Paleo-Indian": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period . The prefix paleo- comes from the Greek adjective palaios ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning old or ancient . The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago . Stone tools , particularly projectile points and scrapers , are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas .",
  "/wiki/Clovis_point": "Clovis points are the characteristically-fluted projectile points associated with the New World Clovis culture . They are present in dense concentrations across much of North America ; in South America , they are largely restricted to the north of that continent . Clovis points date to the Early Paleoindian period roughly 13,500 to 12,800 calendar years ago . Clovis fluted points are named after the city of Clovis , New Mexico , where examples were first found in 1929 by Ridgely Whiteman . A typical Clovis point is a medium to large lanceolate point . Sides are parallel to convex , and exhibit careful pressure flaking along the blade edge . The broadest area is near the midsection or toward the base . The base is distinctly concave with a characteristic flute or channel flake removed from one or , more commonly , both surfaces of the blade . The lower edges of the blade and base are ground to dull edges for hafting . Clovis points also tend to be thicker than the typically thin later-stage Folsom points . with length ranging from 4 to 20 centimetres ( 1.6 to 7.9 in ) and width from 2.5 to 5 centimetres ( 0.98 to 1.97 in ) . Whether the points were knife blades or spear points is an open question .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Effigy_mound": "An effigy mound is a raised pile of earth built in the shape of a stylized animal , symbol , human , or other figure and generally containing one or more human burials . Effigy mounds were primarily built during the Late Woodland Period ( 350-1300 CE ) . Conical and linear mounds , the predecessors of effigy mounds may date from as far back as 700 BCE . They remain places First Peoples frequent to visit and speak with ancestors , to put down tobacco and to give thanks . These sites are primarily visited by Hochungra ( pl . of Hochunk ) people whose ancestors likely built the great majority of them , though they are also visited by people from other original indigenous nations such as Anishinaabe ( Ojibwe ) , Kikapu , Oneida , Menominii who reside in Wisconsin and surrounding areas . There also remains the possibility that a greater diversity of First Peoples such as ancestors of those named nations may have contributed to building some percentage of the mounds . That is to say that ancestral Hochunk likely popularized the form and other groups may have adopted the practice of building effigy mounds from having observed the Hochunk ancestors methods and aesthetics surrounding their construction . Scholars believe that effigy mounds were built primarily for spiritual purposes , although most also fulfilled a burial mound function . According to 2011 ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry studies surveying 586 mounds at 128 sites , 65 % of linear mounds in Wisconsin contain evidence of burials , 89 % of conical mounds contain evidence of burials , and 87 % of effigy ( animal and other abstract shaped ) mounds contain persistent evidence of burials . Older conical mound construction evolves into effigy mound construction over time . Given the expected rates of decay regarding burial evidence ( some conical mounds being as old as 2700 years ) it is reasonable to project that all mounds in the conical-to-effigy mound spectrum , are burial or funerary earthworks .",

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",
  "/wiki/Public_Works_Administration": "Public Works Administration ( PWA ) , part of the New Deal of 1933 , was a large-scale public works construction agency in the United States headed by Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes . It was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933 in response to the Great Depression . It built large-scale public works such as dams , bridges , hospitals , and schools . Its goals were to spend $ 3.3 billion in the first year , and $ 6 billion in all , to provide employment , stabilize purchasing power , and help revive the economy . Most of the spending came in two waves in 1933-35 , and again in 1938 . Originally called the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works , it was renamed the Public Works Administration in 1935 and shut down in 1944 . The PWA spent over $ 7 billion in contracts to private construction firms that did the actual work . It created an infrastructure that generated national and local pride in the 1930s and remains vital eight decades later . The PWA was much less controversial than its rival agency with a confusingly similar name , the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) , headed by Harry Hopkins , which focused on smaller projects and hired unemployed unskilled workers .",

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

The cemetery was established in 1834 after the Stockbridge Indians moved to the community . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 . The Stockbridge initially lived in New York and Massachusetts , but were forced by the federal government to come to Wisconsin . They were largely Christianized farmers and the Indian Commissioners hoped that this acculturation would rub off on the neighboring Indians here . Chief John Metoxin , whose stone is in the cemetery , led them through this movement . But here again white farmers wanted their land , and in the 1840s the government pushed them to dissolve the tribe or sell their land and move west . After debate within the tribe , they decided to stay together . John Quinney ( who is also buried in the cemetery ) traveled to Washington repeatedly , arguing for the Stockbridge , and finally obtained the right for them to stay in Wisconsin . Many of them moved to Shawano County , and their descendants live in the Stockbridge-Munsee Community there . The cemetery is all that remains of the community at Stockbridge .",
  "/wiki/Stockbridge_Indians": "The Stockbridge-Munsee Community also known as the Mohican Nation Stockbridge-Munsee Band is a federally recognized Native American tribe formed in the late eighteenth century from communities of so-called praying Indians ( or Moravian Indians ) , descended from Christianized members of two distinct peoples : Mohicans from the praying town of Stockbridge , Massachusetts , and Munsees . Their land-base , the Stockbridge-Munsee Indian Reservation , is 22,000 acres located at 44\u00b053\u203255\u2033N 88\u00b051\u203242\u2033W / 44.89861\u00b0N 88.86167\u00b0W / 44.89861 ; -88.86167 in Shawano County , Wisconsin . It encompasses the towns of Bartelme and Red Springs . Among their enterprises is the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino . In settlement of a large land claim in New York , where the tribe had occupied land in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , in 2010 the state of New York agreed to give the tribe 330 acres in Sullivan County in the Catskills and two acres in Madison County ( their former territory ) . This was in exchange for dropping their larger claim for 23,000 acres of land in Madison ( near the city of Syracuse ) , which they had occupied in the early 19th century . The state granted the tribe the right to develop the Catskills property as a gaming casino . The deal is controversial and opposed by numerous interests , including other federally recognized tribes in New York . The tribe dropped their bid for a gaming casino in New York in June 2014 , given a high level of competition from other developers for sites in Orange County , which is closer to the metropolitan market .
