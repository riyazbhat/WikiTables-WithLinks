Thousands of years before Europeans arrived , Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples , some of whom remain in the state today . French explorers , missionaries , and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century , encountering the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe tribes .

General Ewing was an ambitious , literate , and erudite officer who held a strong sense of responsibility for the men under his command . He combined his West Point experience with the Civil War system of officer election . Ewing 's wartime service was characterized by several incidents which would have a unique impact on history . In 1861 , his political connections helped save the reputation of his brother-in-law , William T. Sherman , who went on to become one of the north 's most successful generals . Ewing himself went on to become Sherman 's most trusted subordinate . His campaigning eventually led to the near-banishment of Lorenzo Thomas , a high-ranking regular army officer who had intrigued against Sherman . He was present at the Battle of Antietam , where his brigade saved the flank of the Union Army late in the day . During the Vicksburg campaign , Ewing accidentally came across personal correspondence from Confederate President Jefferson F.

  "/wiki/William_T._Sherman": "William Tecumseh Sherman ( February 8 , 1820 - February 14 , 1891 ) was an American soldier , businessman , educator , and author . He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War ( 1861-65 ) , receiving recognition for his command of military strategy as well as criticism for the harshness of the scorched earth policies he implemented in conducting total war against the Confederate States . British military theorist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart declared that Sherman was the first modern general . Born in Ohio to a politically prominent family , Sherman graduated in 1840 from the United States Military Academy at West Point . He interrupted his military career in 1853 to pursue private business ventures , and at the outbreak of the Civil War he was superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy ( now Louisiana State University ) . Sherman distinguished himself at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861 , before being transferred to the Western Theater . Stationed in Kentucky , his pessimism about the outlook of the war led to a nervous breakdown that required him to be briefly put on leave . He recovered by forging a close partnership with General Ulysses S. Grant . Sherman served under Grant in 1862 and 1863 during the battles of forts Henry and Donelson , the Battle of Shiloh , the campaigns that led to the fall of the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River , as well as the Chattanooga Campaign that culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee . In 1864 , Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union commander in the western theater of the war . Sherman then led the capture of the strategic city of Atlanta , a military success that contributed to the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln . Sherman 's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas involved little fighting but large-scale destruction of cotton plantations and other infrastructure , a systematic policy intended to undermine the ability and willingness of the Confederacy to continue fighting for its independence .",
