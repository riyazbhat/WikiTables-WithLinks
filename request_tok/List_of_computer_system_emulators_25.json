  "/wiki/PCem": "PCem ( short for PC Emulator ) is an IBM PC emulator for Windows and Linux that specializes in running old operating systems and software that are designed for IBM PC compatibles . Originally developed as an IBM PC XT emulator , it later emulates other IBM PC compatible computers as well . A fork known as 86Box is also available , which includes a number of added features , such as support for SCSI and additional boards .",
  "/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible": "IBM PC compatible computers are similar to the original IBM PC , XT , and AT that are able to use the same software and expansion cards . Such computers were referred to as PC clones , or IBM clones . The term IBM PC compatible is now a historical description only , since IBM no longer sells personal computers . The industry jargon PC sometimes does n't mean personal computer generally , but rather a computer running Microsoft Windows , in contrast to Apple 's Mac . These clones duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the IBM PC architecture . This was facilitated by IBM 's choice of commodity hardware components and by various manufacturers ' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a clean room design technique . Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS . [ citation needed ] Early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer bus as the original PC and AT models . The IBM AT compatible bus was later named the Industry Standard Architecture ( ISA ) bus by manufacturers of compatible computers . Descendants of the IBM PC compatibles comprise the majority of personal computers on the market presently , with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows , although interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent . Some of these computers ran MS-DOS but had enough hardware differences that IBM compatible software could not be used ; examples include slight differences in the memory map , serial ports or video hardware . Only the Macintosh kept significant market share without having compatibility with the IBM PC .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources . It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI . It is a flexible operating system , and consumes negligible installation space .",
  "/wiki/.NET_Framework": ".NET Framework ( pronounced as dot net ) is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows . It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library ( FCL ) and provides language interoperability ( each language can use code written in other languages ) across several programming languages . Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment ( in contrast to a hardware environment ) named the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) . The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security , memory management , and exception handling . As such , computer code written using .NET Framework is called managed code . FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework . FCL provides the user interface , data access , database connectivity , cryptography , web application development , numeric algorithms , and network communications . Programmers produce software by combining their source code with .NET Framework and other libraries . The framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform . Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment for .NET software called Visual Studio . .NET Framework began as proprietary software , although the firm worked to standardize the software stack almost immediately , even before its first release . Despite the standardization efforts , developers , mainly those in the free and open-source software communities , expressed their unease with the selected terms and the prospects of any free and open-source implementation , especially regarding software patents .",
  "/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history": "Microsoft started development on the .NET Framework in the late 1990s originally under the name of Next Generation Windows Services ( NGWS ) . By late 2001 the first beta versions of .NET 1.0 were released . The first version of .NET Framework was released on 13 February 2002 , bringing managed code to Windows NT 4.0 , 98 , 2000 , ME and XP . Since the first version , Microsoft has released nine more upgrades for .NET Framework , seven of which have been released along with a new version of Visual Studio . Two of these upgrades , .NET Framework 2.0 and 4.0 , have upgraded Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) . New versions of .NET Framework replace older versions when the CLR version is the same . The .NET Framework family also includes two versions for mobile or Embedded device use . A reduced version of the framework , the .NET Compact Framework , is available on Windows CE platforms , including Windows Mobile devices such as smartphones . Additionally , the .NET Micro Framework is targeted at severely resource-constrained devices .",

  "/wiki/Bochs": "Bochs ( pronounced box ) is a portable IA-32 and x86-64 IBM PC compatible emulator and debugger mostly written in C++ and distributed as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License . It supports emulation of the processor ( s ) ( including protected mode ) , memory , disks , display , Ethernet , BIOS and common hardware peripherals of PCs . Many guest operating systems can be run using the emulator including DOS , several versions of Microsoft Windows , BSDs , Linux , Xenix and Rhapsody ( precursor of Mac OS X ) . Bochs runs on many host operating systems , including Android , Linux , macOS , PlayStation 2 , Windows , and Windows Mobile . Bochs is mostly used for operating system development ( when an emulated operating system crashes , it does not crash the host operating system , so the emulated OS can be debugged ) and to run other guest operating systems inside already running host operating systems . It can also be used to run older software - such as PC games - which will not run on non-compatible , or too fast computers .",
  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development .",

The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",

JavaScript is high-level , often just-in-time compiled , and multi-paradigm . It has curly-bracket syntax , dynamic typing , prototype-based object-orientation , and first-class functions . Alongside HTML and CSS , JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web . JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications . The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior , and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it . As a multi-paradigm language , JavaScript supports event-driven , functional , and imperative programming styles . It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text , dates , regular expressions , standard data structures , and the Document Object Model ( DOM ) . However , the language itself does not include any input/output ( I/O ) , such as networking , storage , or graphics facilities , as the host environment ( usually a web browser ) provides those APIs . Originally used only in web browsers , JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications . Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java , including language name , syntax , and respective standard libraries , the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design .",
  "/wiki/Google_Native_Client": "Google Native Client ( NaCl ) is a sandboxing technology for running either a subset of Intel x86 , ARM , or MIPS native code , or a portable executable , in a sandbox . It allows safely running native code from a web browser , independent of the user operating system , allowing web apps to run at near-native speeds , which aligns with Google 's plans for Chrome OS . It may also be used for securing browser plugins , and parts of other applications or full applications such as ZeroVM . To demonstrate the readiness of the technology , on 9 December 2011 , Google announced the availability of several new Chrome-only versions of games known for their rich and processor-intensive graphics , including Bastion ( no longer supported on the Chrome Web Store ) . NaCl runs hardware-accelerated 3D graphics ( via OpenGL ES 2.0 ) , sandboxed local file storage , dynamic loading , full screen mode , and mouse capture . There are also plans to make NaCl available on handheld devices . Portable Native Client ( PNaCl ) is an architecture-independent version . PNaCl apps are compiled ahead-of-time . PNaCl is recommended over NaCl for most use cases . The general concept of NaCl ( running native code in web browser ) has been implemented before in ActiveX , which , while still in use , has full access to the system ( disk , memory , user-interface , registry , etc. ) . Native Client avoids this issue by using sandboxing . An alternative of sorts to NaCl is asm.js , which also allows applications written in C or C++ to be compiled to run in the browser ( at more than half the native speed ) , and also supports ahead-of-time compilation , but is a subset of JavaScript and hence backwards-compatible with browsers that do not support it directly .",

In 1984 , Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the Classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software . The system , rebranded Mac OS in 1996 , was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s . Noted for its ease of use , it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors . The current Mac operating system is macOS , originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016 . Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple 's purchase of NeXT , Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP , a Unix system , that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced . The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually . It is the basis of Apple 's current system software for its other devices - iOS , iPadOS , watchOS , and tvOS . Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X , Apple experimented with several other concepts , releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa , A/UX , MAE , and MkLinux . Apple 's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects , code named Star Trek , Taligent , and Copland . Although they have different architectures , the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI principles , including a menu bar across the top of the screen ; the Finder shell , featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can ; and overlapping windows for multitasking .",

QEMU is a hosted virtual machine monitor : it emulates the machine 's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine , enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems . It also can be used with KVM to run virtual machines at near-native speed ( by taking advantage of hardware extensions such as Intel VT-x ) . QEMU can also do emulation for user-level processes , allowing applications compiled for one architecture to run on another .",
  "/wiki/AMD_K8": "The AMD K8 Hammer , also code-named SledgeHammer , is a computer processor microarchitecture designed by AMD as the successor to the AMD K7 Athlon microarchitecture . The K8 was the first implementation of the AMD64 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set architecture .",
  "/wiki/Athlon_64": "The Athlon 64 is an eighth-generation , AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by AMD , released on September 23 , 2003 . It is the third processor to bear the name Athlon , and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP . The second processor ( after the Opteron ) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer , it was AMD 's primary consumer microprocessor , and competes primarily with Intel 's Pentium 4 , especially the Prescott and Cedar Mill core revisions . It is AMD 's first K8 , eighth-generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers . Despite being natively 64-bit , the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions . Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754 , Socket 939 , Socket 940 and Socket AM2 . The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines .",
  "/wiki/Opteron": "Opteron is AMD 's x86 former server and workstation processor line , and was the first processor which supported the AMD64 instruction set architecture ( known generically as x86-64 or AMD64 ) . It was released on April 22 , 2003 , with the SledgeHammer core ( K8 ) and was intended to compete in the server and workstation markets , particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor . Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture ( codenamed Barcelona ) were announced on September 10 , 2007 , featuring a new quad-core configuration . The most-recently released Opteron CPUs are the Piledriver-based Opteron 4300 and 6300 series processors , codenamed Seoul and Abu Dhabi respectively . In January 2016 , the first ARMv8-A based Opteron SoC was released .",
  "/wiki/X86-64": "x86-64 ( also known as x64 , x86_64 , AMD64 and Intel 64 [ note 1 ] ) is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set . It introduces two new modes of operation , 64-bit mode and compatibility mode , along with a new 4-level paging mode . With 64-bit mode and the new paging mode , it supports vastly larger amounts of virtual memory and physical memory than is possible on its 32-bit predecessors , allowing programs to store larger amounts of data in memory . x86-64 also expands general-purpose registers to 64-bit , as well extends the number of them from 8 ( some of which had limited or fixed functionality , e.g . for stack management ) to 16 ( fully general ) , and provides numerous other enhancements . Floating point operations are supported via mandatory SSE2-like instructions , and x87/MMX style registers are generally not used ( but still available even in 64-bit mode ) ; instead , a set of 32 vector registers , 128 bits each , is used . ( Each can store one or two double-precision numbers or one to four single precision numbers , or various integer formats . ) In 64-bit mode , instructions are modified to support 64-bit operands and 64-bit addressing mode . The compatibility mode allows 16- and 32-bit user applications to run unmodified coexisting with 64-bit applications if the 64-bit operating system supports them . [ note 2 ] As the full x86 16-bit and 32-bit instruction sets remain implemented in hardware without any intervening emulation , these older executables can run with little or no performance penalty , while newer or modified applications can take advantage of new features of the processor design to achieve performance improvements . Also , a processor supporting x86-64 still powers on in real mode for full backward compatibility , as x86 processors have done since the 80286 . The original specification , created by AMD and released in 2000 , has been implemented by AMD , Intel and VIA .",
