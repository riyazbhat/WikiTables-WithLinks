  "/wiki/Milk": "Milk is a nutrient-rich , white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals . It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals ( including humans who are breastfed ) before they are able to digest other types of food . Early-lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases . It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products . China and Russia were the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient , contributing to a worldwide glut of milk . Throughout the world , more than six billion people consume milk and milk products",

  "/wiki/Herve_cheese": "Herve is a Belgian rind washed soft cheese made from raw cow 's milk . The aging process takes place in ripening cellars of the Herve countryside , sometimes cut into its chalky rock . Herve comes from the Belgian town of the same name , which was part of the Duchy of Limburg . It has been produced since the 15th century . Other variants of pungent and soft Limburger cheeses are now made in many countries , using the name derived from the old Duchy . It is sometimes flavored with herbs . Herve has a pale yellow interior with a glossy reddish-brown coating created by the bacteria that grow during its 3-month aging . It is usually shaped into a brick when sold . The taste and flavor of the cheese deepens during the period of ripening . When young , the interior is sweet , and with age it becomes spicy . Because it is so strong , Herve is best eaten with dark breads and beers . It is often regarded as one of the most popular cheeses in Belgium",

  "/wiki/Duchy_of_Limburg": "The Duchy of Limburg or Limbourg was an imperial estate of the Holy Roman Empire . Its main territory including the capital , the fortified town of Limbourg-sur-Vesdre , is today located within the Belgian province of Li\u00e8ge , with a small part in the neighbouring province of Belgian Limburg , within the east of Voeren . The Duchy evolved from a county which was first assembled under the lordship of a junior member of the House of Ardennes , Frederick , and he also built and apparently named the fortified town , which the county , and later the Duchy , were named after . Despite being a younger son , Frederick had a successful career and became Duke of Lower Lotharingia in 1046 . Lordship of this county was not originally automatically linked with possession of a ducal title ( Herzog in German , Hertog in Dutch ) , and the same title also eventually contested by counts of Brabant , leading to the invention of two new Ducal titles : Brabant and Limbourg . The extinction of the line of Frederick 's grandson Henry in 1283 sparked the War of the Limburg Succession , whereafter Limburg was ruled by the Dukes of Brabant in personal union , eventually being grouped together with the Brabantian Overmaas territories bordering it ( including Dalhem , Valkenburg , and Hertogenrade ) , to be one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Burgundian Netherlands . Unlike other parts of this province , the lands of the duchy stayed intact within the Southern Netherlands , under Habsburg control , after the divisions caused by the Eighty Years ' War and the War of the Spanish Succession . However finally , after the failed Brabant Revolution in 1789 , the duchy 's history was terminated with the occupation by French Revolutionary troops in 1793 . These lands were reunited within modern Belgium only after World War I . The duchy was multilingual , being the place where Dutch , French , and German dialects border upon each other and coexist at their geographical extremes , both now and in medieval times . Its northern and eastern borders are the approximate boundaries of the modern state of Belgium with the Netherlands and Germany , at their tripoint . The eastern part , which includes Eupen , is the administrative capital and northernmost part of the modern Belgian German-speaking Ostkantonen",

  "/wiki/Maredsous_cheese": "Maredsous is a semi-hard loaf-shaped washed-rind cheese made from cow 's milk . It is suitable for slicing , and characterised by an orange coloured rind . The cheese has been produced at Maredsous Abbey in Belgium since 1953 . The cheese is lightly pressed , then washed in brine to create the firm , orange crust and pungent aroma . Each cheese is washed by hand every two days , starting with the older cheeses . The water used for the washing of the older cheeses picks up the appropriate bacteria which are then transferred to the younger cheeses when the same water is used for washing these . The maturing process in the cellar takes place over 22 days . Maredsous is now an industrially produced cheese , produced by Groupe Bel . It was formerly matured in the abbey cellars where the even temperature of 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) and the 95 % humidity favour the micro-organisms that transform the raw curd into cheese . The only cheeses still manufactured at the abbey are in the traditional sizes of 390g , 800g and 2.5kg .

  "/wiki/Walloon_language": "Walloon ( /w\u0252\u02c8lu\u02d0n/ ; natively walon ) is a Romance language that is spoken in much of Wallonia in Belgium , in some villages of northern France ( near Givet ) and in the northeast part of Wisconsin , US until the mid 20th century and in some parts of Canada . [ citation needed ] It belongs to the langue d'o\u00efl language family , whose most prominent member is the French language . The historical background of its formation was the territorial extension since 980 of the Principality of Li\u00e8ge to the south and west . Despite its rich literature , beginning anonymously in the 16th century and with well-known authors since 1756 , the use of Walloon has decreased markedly since France 's annexation of Wallonia in 1795 . This period definitively established French as the language of social promotion , far more than it was before . After World War I , public schools provided French-speaking education to all children , inducing a denigration of Walloon , especially when accompanied by official orders in 1952 to punish its use in schools . Subsequently , since the middle of the 20th century , generational transmission of the language has decreased , resulting in Walloon almost becoming a dead language . Today it is scarcely spoken among younger people , with vast majority of its native speakers being the elderly ( aged 65 and over ) . In 1996 , the number of people with knowledge of the language was estimated at between 1 and 1.3 million . Numerous associations , especially theatre companies , are working to keep the language alive . Formally recognized as a langue r\u00e9gionale endog\u00e8ne ( regional indigenous language ) of Belgium since 1990 , Walloon has also benefited from a continued corpus planning process .
