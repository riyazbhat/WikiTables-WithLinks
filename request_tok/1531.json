  "/wiki/Gogo_Station": "Gogo or Gogo Station and sometimes referred to as Margaret Downs is a pastoral lease that has operated as a cattle station . It is located about 11 kilometres ( 7 mi ) south of Fitzroy Crossing and 83 kilometres ( 52 mi ) north east of Yungngora in the Kimberley region of Western Australia , The area was first explored by Alexander Forrest in 1879 , who gave enthusiastic reports of the well grassed and watered country that would be suitable for grazing lands . Among those to take up leases were the Durack and the Emanuel families who together claimed over one million acres along the Fitzroy River in the West Kimberley and a similar amount along the Ord River in the East Kimberley . After an expedition to the area the Duracks decided to take up the lands along the Ord and the Emanuels took the area along the Fitzroy . The station was established in 1885 , and in 1902 occupied and area of 1,750,000 acres ( 708,200 ha ) . The country is on the flood-plain of the Fitzroy River and is well covered in Mitchell and Flinders grass with large areas of spinifex . A large number of cattle was lost on Gogo and on Fossil Downs Station in 1906 following an extended dry spell . Other neighbouring stations lost several hundred cattle each . By 1910 the station had an estimated herd of 35,000 cattle and the station manager was being paid an annual salary of \u00a3600 a year . In 1911 the station was being managed by George Piper and was owned by the Emanuel Bros. , who also owned Noonkanbah Station located further to the south east . Following the advent of the revision of the Land Act limiting holdings up to one million acres , several of the properties of the Emanuels had to be disposed of . Gogo was dissolved into three separate properties ; Margaret Downs ( also known as Gogo ) , Cherrabun and Christmas Creek , and these together with Meda Station are still held by the descendants of the original partners .",
