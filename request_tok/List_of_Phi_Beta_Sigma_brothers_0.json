  "/wiki/George_Washington_Carver": "George Washington Carver ( 1860s - January 5 , 1943 ) was an American agricultural scientist and inventor . He actively promoted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion . He was the most prominent black scientist of the early 20th century . While a professor at Tuskegee Institute , Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton . He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops such as peanuts and sweet potatoes as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life . The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts . Although he spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts , none became commercially successful . Apart from his work to improve the lives of farmers , Carver was also a leader in promoting environmentalism . He received numerous honors for his work , including the Spingarn Medal of the NAACP . In an era of high racial polarization , his fame reached beyond the black community . He was widely recognized and praised in the white community for his many achievements and talents . In 1941 , Time magazine dubbed Carver a Black Leonardo",
  "/wiki/Peanut": "The peanut , also known as the groundnut , goober ( US ) , or monkey nut ( UK ) , and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea , is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds . It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics , being important to both small and large commercial producers . It is classified as both a grain legume and , due to its high oil content , an oil crop . World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016 , led by China with 38 % of the world total . Atypically among legume crop plants , peanut pods develop underground ( geocarpy ) rather than above ground . With this characteristic in mind , the botanist Carl Linnaeus named the species hypogaea , which means under the earth . As a legume , the peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae ; this is also known as Leguminosae , and commonly known as the bean , or pea , family . Like most other legumes , peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules . This capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and also improve soil fertility , making them valuable in crop rotations . Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds , and as a culinary nut are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines . The botanical definition of a nut is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity . Using this criterion , the peanut is not a typical nut",
  "/wiki/Sweet_potato": "The sweet potato or sweetpotato ( Ipomoea batatas ) is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the bindweed or morning glory family , Convolvulaceae . Its large , starchy , sweet-tasting , tuberous roots are a root vegetable . The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as greens . The sweet potato is commonly thought to be a type of potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) but does not belong to the nightshade family , Solanaceae , but both families belong to the same taxonomic order , the Solanales . The sweet potato , especially the orange variety , is often called a yam in parts of North America , but is botanically very distinct from true yams . The plant is a herbaceous perennial vine , bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers . The edible tuberous root is long and tapered , with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow , orange , red , brown , purple , and beige . Its flesh ranges from beige through white , red , pink , violet , yellow , orange , and purple . Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red , pink or orange flesh . Ipomoea batatas is native to the tropical regions in the Americas . Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae , I. batatas is the only crop plant of major importance - some others are used locally ( e.g. , I. aquatica kangkong ) , but many are poisonous . The genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning glories , though that term is not usually extended to Ipomoea batatas",

Established by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in 1863 , it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East , where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception . It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents , known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds , spread throughout most of the world 's countries and territories . It grew from the mid-19th-century B\u00e1b\u00ed religion , whose founder ( the B\u00e1b ) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad . In 1863 , after being banished from his native Iran , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h ( 1817-1892 ) announced that he was this prophet . He was further exiled , spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine . Following Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h 's death in 1892 , leadership of the religion fell to his son \u02bbAbdu ' l-Bah\u00e1 ( 1844-1921 ) , and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi ( 1897-1957 ) . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world annually elect local , regional , and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion , and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice , the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community , which sits in Haifa , Israel , near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths : God is considered single and all-powerful . However , Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history ; Buddha , Jesus , and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h . Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose , though varied in social practices and interpretations . There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people , openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism"
