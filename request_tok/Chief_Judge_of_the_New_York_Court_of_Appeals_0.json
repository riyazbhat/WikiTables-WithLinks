  "/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy",

  "/wiki/Know_Nothing": "The Know Nothing , formally known as the Native American Party and the American Party from 1855 onwards , was a far-right nativist political party and movement in the United States which operated nationwide in the mid-1850s . It was primarily an anti-Catholic , anti-immigration , and xenophobic movement , originally starting as a secret society . The Know Nothing movement also briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party . Adherents to the movement were to simply reply I know nothing when asked about its specifics by outsiders , providing the group with its common name . Supporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged Romanist conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States , and sought to politically organize native-born Protestants in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values . The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters . In most places , the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders , a lack of publicly declared national leaders , and a deep split over the issue of slavery . In the South , the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North , but it became the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party . The collapse of the Whig Party after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party . The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts and several other individuals in the 1854 elections into the U.S. Congress ( with Banks becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives ) , and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party . Particularly in the South , the American Party served as a vehicle for politicians opposed to the Democrats . Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging Republican Party",
