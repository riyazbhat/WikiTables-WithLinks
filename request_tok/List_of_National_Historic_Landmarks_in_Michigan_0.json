  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Camp_meeting": "The camp meeting is a form of Protestant Christian religious service originating in England and Scotland as an evangelical event in association with the communion season . It was held for worship , preaching and communion on the American frontier during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century . Revivals and camp meetings continued to be held by various denominations , and in some areas of the mid-Atlantic , led to the development of seasonal cottages for meetings . Originally camp meetings were held in frontier areas , where people without regular preachers would travel on occasion from a large region to a particular site to camp , pray , sing hymns , and listen to itinerant preachers at the tabernacle . Camp meetings offered community , often singing and other music , sometimes dancing , and diversion from work . The practice was a major component of the Second Great Awakening , an evangelical movement promoted by Baptist , Methodist , Presbyterian and other preachers in the early 19th century . Certain denominations took the lead in different geographic areas . Camp meetings today are often held annually at campgrounds owned by a Christian denomination .",
  "/wiki/Romanticism": "Romanticism ( also known as the Romantic era ) was an artistic , literary , musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century , and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850 . Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature , preferring the medieval rather than the classical . It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution , the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment , and the scientific rationalization of nature - all components of modernity . It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts , music , and literature , but had a major impact on historiography , education , the social sciences , and the natural sciences . [ failed verification ] It had a significant and complex effect on politics , with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism , radicalism , conservatism and nationalism . The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience , placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension , horror and terror , and awe - especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublimity and beauty of nature . It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble , but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic ( as in the musical impromptu ) . In contrast to the Rationalism and Classicism of the Enlightenment , Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth , early urban sprawl , and industrialism . Although the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement , which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment , the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors . Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of heroic individualists and artists , whose examples , it maintained , would raise the quality of society . It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art . There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability , a Zeitgeist , in the representation of its ideas .",

  "/wiki/Idealism": "In philosophy , idealism is the diverse group of metaphysical philosophies which assert that reality is in some way indistinguishable or inseparable from human understanding and/or perception ; that it is in some sense mentally constituted , or otherwise closely connected to ideas . According to Immanuel Kant , a pioneer of modern idealist thought , idealism does not concern the existence of things , but asserts only that our modes of representation of them , above all space and time , are not determinations that belong to things in themselves but essential features of our own minds . Kant called this position transcendental and critical idealism , since it describes the way in which reality is utterly transcended by , and can not be thought separate from , the categories with which they are structered by and in human understanding . Epistemologically , idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing . In contrast to materialism , idealism asserts the primacy of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of phenomena . Idealism holds consciousness or mind to be the origin of the material world - in the sense that it is a necessary condition for our positing of a material world - and it aims to explain the existing world according to these principles . In Anglo-American scholarship , idealist theories are primarily divided into two groups . Subjective idealism takes as its starting point the given fact of human consciousness seeing the existing world as a combination of sensation . Objective idealism posits the existence of an objective consciousness which exists before and , in some sense , independently of human ones . In a sociological sense , idealism emphasizes how human ideas - especially beliefs and values - shape society . As an ontological doctrine , idealism goes further , asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit . Idealism thus rejects those physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind .",

His introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry . As the owner of the Ford Motor Company , he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world . He is credited with Fordism : mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers . Ford had a global vision , with consumerism as the key to peace . His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations , including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents . Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation and arranged for his family to control the company permanently . Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I , and for promoting antisemitic content , including The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent and the book The International Jew , having an alleged influence on the development of Nazism and Adolf Hitler .",

The style is usually marked by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , integration with the landscape , solid construction , craftsmanship , and discipline in the use of ornament . Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H.

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile , that made car travel available to middle-class Americans . The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford 's efficient fabrication , including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting . The Ford Model T was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition , ahead of the BMC Mini , Citro\u00ebn DS , and Volkswagen Type 1 .

  "/wiki/Continuous-flow_manufacturing": "Continuous-flow manufacturing , or Repetitive-Flow Manufacturing , is an approach to discrete manufacturing that contrasts with batch production . It is associated with a just-in-time and kanban production approach , and calls for an ongoing examination and improvement efforts which ultimately requires integration of all elements of the production system . The goal is an optimally balanced production line with little waste , the lowest possible cost , on-time and defect-free production . This strategy is typically applied in discrete manufacturing as an attempt to handle production volumes comprising discrete units of product in a flow which is more naturally found in process manufacturing . The basic fact is that in most cases , discrete units of a solid product can not be handled in the same way as continuous quantities of liquid , gas or powder . Discrete manufacturing is more likely to be performed in batches of product units that are routed from process to process in the factory . Each process may add value to the batch during a run-time or work-time . There is usually some time spent waiting for the process during a queue-time or wait-time . The larger the batch , the longer each unit has to wait for the rest of the batch to be completed , before it can go forward to the next process . This queue-time is waste , Muda , and represents time lost that is not value-added in the eyes of the customer . This waste is one of the most important elements targeted for reduction and elimination in lean manufacturing . Reducing the batch size in discrete manufacturing is therefore a desirable goal : it improves the speed of response to the customer , whilst improving the ratio of value-added to non value-added work .",

Mackinaw City is at the northern tip ( headland ) of the Michigan 's Lower Peninsula along the southern shore of the Straits of Mackinac . Across the straits lies the state 's Upper Peninsula . These two land masses are physically connected by the Mackinac Bridge , which runs from Mackinaw City north to St. Ignace .

  "/wiki/Lower_Peninsula_of_Michigan": "The Lower Peninsula of Michigan is the southern of the two major landmasses of the U.S. state of Michigan , the other being the Upper Peninsula . It is surrounded by water on all sides except its southern border , which it shares with Indiana and Ohio . Although the Upper Peninsula is commonly referred to as the U.P. , it is fairly uncommon for the Lower Peninsula to be called the L.P. Because of its recognizable shape , the Lower Peninsula is nicknamed the mitten , with the eastern region identified as The Thumb . This has led to several folkloric creation myths for the area , one being that it is a hand print of Paul Bunyan , a giant lumberjack and popular European-American folk character in Michigan . When asked where they live , Lower Peninsula residents may hold up their right palm and point to a spot on it to indicate the location . The peninsula is sometimes divided into the Northern Lower Peninsula - which is more sparsely populated and largely forested - and the Southern Lower Peninsula - which is largely urban or farmland . The Lower Peninsula dominates Michigan politics , and maps of it without the Upper Peninsula are sometimes presented as Michigan , which contributes to resentment by Yoopers ( residents of the U.P ) . Yoopers jokingly refer to residents of the Lower Peninsula as flat-landers ( referring to the region 's less rugged terrain ) or trolls ( because , living south of the Mackinac Bridge , they live under the bridge ) .",
  "/wiki/American_Revolution": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt which occurred between 1765 and 1783 . The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) with the assistance of France , winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America . The American colonials proclaimed no taxation without representation starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 . They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they had no representatives in that governing body . Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 , followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 . The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony 's rights of self-government . The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts , and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain ; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories . Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George 's forces attempted to destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 . The conflict then developed into war , during which the Patriots ( and later their French allies ) fought the British and Loyalists in the Revolutionary War . Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments , suppressed Loyalism , and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington . The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists ' rights as Englishmen , and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2 , 1776 . The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy , and they proclaimed that all men are created equal .",

  "/wiki/International_Style_(architecture)": "The International Style or internationalism is a major architectural style that was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was closely related to modernism and modern architecture . It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932 , based on works of architecture from the 1920s . The terms rationalist architecture and modern movement are often used interchangeably with International Style , although the former is mostly used in the English-speaking world to specifically refer to the Italian rationalism of architects such as Giuseppe Terragni and Gino Pollini , or even the International Style that developed in Europe as a whole . It is defined by the Getty Research Institute as the style of architecture that emerged in Holland , France , and Germany after World War I and spread throughout the world , becoming the dominant architectural style until the 1970s . The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass , the use of lightweight , mass-produced , industrial materials , rejection of all ornament and colour , repetitive modular forms , and the use of flat surfaces , typically alternating with areas of glass .",
