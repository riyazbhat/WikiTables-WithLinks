The traditional recipe for this dish calls for squid ink , cuttlefish or squid , white rice , garlic , green cubanelle peppers , sweet paprika , olive oil and seafood broth . However , many cooks add other seafood as well , such as crab and shrimp . The dish 's dark color comes from squid ink which also enhances its seafood flavor . In addition to Valencia and Catalonia , this dish is popular in Cuba and Puerto Rico where on both islands it is known as arroz con calamares ( rice with squid in Spanish ) . In the Philippines , it is considered to be a subtype of the Filipino adaptation of paelya and is known as paella negra ( or paelya negra ) . Black rice dishes with cuttlefish or squid ink are also made in Italy , Croatia and Montenegro , where they are known as black risotto .

[ c ] Catalonia consists of four provinces : Barcelona , Girona , Lleida , and Tarragona . The capital and largest city is Barcelona , the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the core of the sixth most populous urban area in the European Union . It comprises most of the territory of the former Principality of Catalonia ( with the remainder Roussillon now part of France 's Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales , Occitanie ) . It is bordered by France ( Occitanie ) and Andorra to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the east , and the Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon to the west and Valencia to the south . The official languages are Catalan , Spanish , and the Aranese dialect of Occitan . In the late 8th century , the counties of the March of Gothia and the Hispanic March were established by the Frankish kingdom as feudal vassals across and near the eastern Pyrenees as a defensive barrier against Muslim invasions . The eastern counties of these marches were united under the rule of the Frankish vassal , the count of Barcelona . In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became independent de facto . In 1137 , Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon were united by marriage under the Crown of Aragon . The de jure end of Frankish rule was ratified by French and Aragonese monarchs in the Treaty of Corbeil in 1258 . The Principality of Catalonia developed its own institutional system , such as courts ( parliament ) , and constitutions , becoming the base for the Crown of Aragon 's naval power , trade and expansionism in the Mediterranean .",

In the Catalan counties of Alta Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars , formerly territories united to the historic County of Ribagorza in medieval Aragon , chireta is known as gireta , or girella , respectively . Being a mountain recipe , nothing goes to waste : once the choice cuts of a slaughtered sheep have been reserved , the intestines , tripe , neck meat , minced liver including heart and lungs , are all used . This is enhanced with rice , chopped pancetta or bacon , cured ham , parsley , garlic , a pinch of cinnamon , salt and white pepper . Chireta literally means inside out - i.e. , the sheep 's intestines which make up the casings are cleaned and turned inside out for a smoother , more appetizing appearance . The casing is cleaned in white vinegar then rinsed very well before filling . The filling contains rice mixed with garlic , parsley and seasoned chopped meats . Casings are filled about a half to two-thirds of the way with the rice mixture , taking care not to overfill them , as the rice will expand once the chiretas are boiled in the broth - otherwise they are likely to burst . Once trussed , and just before cooking , they are also examined to make sure any air pockets are pushed out . Chiretas are usually served hot , as a main dish . However they taste just as good , if not better , when served up as tapas , sliced , dipped in an egg-flour batter , and fried to a golden color .",

Escabeche is a popular presentation of canned or potted preserved fish , such as mackerel , tuna , bonito or sardines . In the New World , versions of the basic marinade are often used with foods other than fish and meats , for example cassava or green bananas with chicken gizzards ( Puerto Rico ) , jalape\u00f1o peppers ( Mexico ) , etc .
