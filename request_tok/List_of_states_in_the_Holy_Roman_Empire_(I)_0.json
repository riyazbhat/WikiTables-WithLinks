It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized",

It became a stem duchy in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire , became an independent kingdom , joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom , and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 . The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555 . In the 17th century AD , the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire .

  "/wiki/Limburg-Styrum": "The house of Limburg Stirum ( or Limburg-Styrum ) , which adopted its name in the 12th century from the sovereign county of Limburg an der Lenne in what is now Germany , is one of the oldest families in Europe . It is the eldest and only surviving branch of the House of Berg , which was among the most powerful dynasties in the region of the lower Rhine during the Middle Ages . Some historians link them to an even older dynasty , the Ezzonen , going back to the 9th century . The Limburg-Stirum were sovereign counts within the Holy Roman Empire , until they were mediatised in 1806 by the Confederation of the Rhine . Although undisputedly a mediatised comital family , having enjoyed a dynastic status for over 600 years until the collapse of the Empire , they were omitted from the Almanach de Gotha because the branches of the family possessing mediatised lands were extinct by the time ( 1815 ) that the Congress of Vienna established the German Confederation 's obligation to recognise their dynastic status . Since the 9th century , the family counted five Counts Palatine of Lotharingia , several Dukes of Westphalia , Bavaria , Carinthia and Swabia , seven Archbishops of Cologne , one Prince-Bishop of Speyer , more than ten bishops in the Holy Roman Empire , and at least two saints of the Catholic Church ( Saint Richenza , celebrated on 21 March , and Saint Engelbert of Cologne , celebrated on 7 November ) . The territorial authority of the family , counts of Berg since 1077 , counts of Altena and Isenberg , then counts of Limburg since 1246 , was significantly reduced following the opposition of Frederick II , Count of Isenberg to the aggression of his cousin , the Archbishop of Cologne , Engelbert II of Berg , leading to the murder of the latter .
