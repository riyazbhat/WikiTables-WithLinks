  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_5th_congressional_district": "The 5th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in northern South Carolina bordering North Carolina . The district includes all of Cherokee , Chester , Fairfield , Kershaw , Lancaster , Lee , Union and York counties and parts of Newberry , Spartanburg and Sumter counties . Outside the rapidly growing cities of Rock Hill , Fort Mill , and Lake Wylie the district is mostly rural and agricultural . The district borders were contracted from some of the easternmost counties in the 2012 redistricting . The district 's character is very similar to other mostly rural districts in the South . Democrats still hold most offices outside Republican-dominated York County . However , few of the area 's Democrats can be described as liberal by national standards ; most are fairly conservative on social issues , but less so on economics . The largest blocs of Republican voters are in the fast-growing suburbs of Charlotte , North Carolina and Cherokee County , which shares the Republican tilt of most of the rest of the Upstate . York County is by far the largest county in the district , with almost one-third of its population , and its Republican bent has pushed the district as a whole into the Republican column in recent years . In November 2010 , the Republican Mick Mulvaney defeated longtime Congressman John Spratt and became the first Republican since Robert Smalls and the end of Reconstruction to represent the district . Following Mulvaney 's confirmation as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , a special election was held in 2017 to determine his successor .
