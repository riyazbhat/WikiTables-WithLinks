The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice .

  "/wiki/British_Army": "The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom , a part of British Armed Forces . As of 2019 [ update ] , the British Army comprises just over 79,300 trained regular ( full-time ) personnel and just over 27,200 trained reserve ( part-time ) personnel . The modern British Army traces back to 1707 , with an antecedent in the English Army that was created during the Restoration in 1660 . The term British Army was adopted in 1707 after the Acts of Union between England and Scotland . Members of the British Army swear allegiance to the monarch as their commander-in-chief , but the Bill of Rights of 1689 requires parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a peacetime standing army . Therefore , Parliament approves the army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years . The army is administered by the Ministry of Defence and commanded by the Chief of the General Staff . The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world 's great powers , including the Seven Years ' War , the Napoleonic Wars , the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars . Britain 's victories in these decisive wars allowed it to influence world events and establish itself as one of the world 's leading military and economic powers . Since the end of the Cold War , the British Army has been deployed to a number of conflict zones , often as part of an expeditionary force , a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation .",
