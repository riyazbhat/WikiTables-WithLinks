He also heaped praise on Cusanus and Bessarion and used his dedicatory preface to Apuleius to laud Bessarion 's Defensio Platonis . He also incorporated an edition of Alcinous translated by Pietro Balbi into his printing of Apuleius . The preface to this version elicited a correspondence with George of Trebizond and his son Andreas . Andreas attacked Bussi and Bessarion in a letter entitled Platonis Accusatio and Bussi directed a response to Andreas in the preface to his edition of Strabo . The debate lasted until 1472 .

Other noteworthy publications are the Historia Romana of Appianus ( 1477 ) , and the first edition of Euclid 's Elements ( 1482 ) , where he solved the problem of printing geometric diagrams , the Poeticon astronomicon , also from 1482 , Haly Abenragel ( 1485 ) , and Alchabitius ( 1503 ) . Ratdolt is also famous for having produced the first known printer 's type specimen book ( in this instance a broadsheet displaying the fonts with which he might print ) . His innovations of layout and typography , mixing type and woodcuts , have subsequently been much admired . His graphic choices and technical solutions influenced also those of William Morris",
  "/wiki/Plato": "Plato ( /\u02c8ple\u026ato\u028a/ ; PLAY-toe Greek : \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd Pl\u00e1t\u014dn , pronounced [ pl\u00e1.t\u0254\u02d0n ] in Classical Attic ; 428/427 or 424/423 - 348/347 BC ) was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece , founder of the Platonist school of thought , and the Academy , the first institution of higher learning in the Western world . He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy , along with his teacher , Socrates , and his most famous student , Aristotle . [ a ] Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality . The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry influenced Saint Augustine and thus Christianity . Alfred North Whitehead once noted : the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato . Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy . Plato is also considered the founder of Western political philosophy . His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason , in which Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism ( also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism ) . He is also the namesake of Platonic love and the Platonic solids . His own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been along with Socrates , the pre-Socratics Pythagoras , Heraclitus and Parmenides , although few of his predecessors ' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself . [ b ] Unlike the work of nearly all of his contemporaries , Plato 's entire body of work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years . Although their popularity has fluctuated over the years , the works of Plato have never been without readers since the time they were written",

He attended chiefly to the printing of Greek books and published the Greek Anthology , edited by Janus Lascaris , with a commentary , and dedicated to Pietro de ' Medici , Aug. 8 , 1494 , in quarto ; The Hymns of Callimachus , in quarto ; Gnomae Monostichae , with the poem of the Musaeum , in quarto ; four tragedies of Euripides : Medea , Hippolytus , Alcestis , Andromache , small edition in quarto ; the first edition ( editio princeps ) of the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes , 1496 , in quarto . These editions are remarkable for the beauty of the paper and the elegance of the Greek type . The first edition of Marsilio Ficino 's Latin translation of Plato , which contains at the end of the Symposium the name of Laurentius Venetus , is also supposed to have come from the press of Lorenzo de Alopa .

Originating from Smyrna , now Izmir in Turkey , he had seen and heard the preaching of Polycarp , the last known living connection with the Apostles , who in turn was said to have heard John the Evangelist . Chosen as bishop of Lugdunum , now Lyon , his best-known work is Against Heresies , often cited as Adversus Haereses , an attack on gnosticism , in particular that of Valentinus . To counter the doctrines of the gnostic sects claiming secret wisdom , he offered three pillars of orthodoxy : the scriptures , the tradition handed down from the apostles , and the teaching of the apostles ' successors . Intrinsic to his writing is that the surest source of Christian guidance is the church of Rome , and he is the earliest surviving witness to regard all four of the now-canonical gospels as essential . He is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church , which celebrates his feast on 28 June , and in the Eastern Orthodox Church , which celebrates the feast on 23 August",

Originally trained as a Catholic priest , Erasmus was an important figure in classical scholarship who wrote in a pure Latin style . Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet Prince of the Humanists , and has been called the crowning glory of the Christian humanists . Using humanist techniques for working on texts , he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament , which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation . He also wrote On Free Will , In Praise of Folly , Handbook of a Christian Knight , On Civility in Children , Copia : Foundations of the Abundant Style , Julius Exclusus , and many other works . Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation . While he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform , he nonetheless kept his distance from Luther , Henry VIII , and John Calvin and continued to recognise the authority of the pope , emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith , piety and grace , and rejecting Luther 's emphasis on faith alone . Erasmus remained a member of the Catholic Church all his life , remaining committed to reforming the church and its clerics ' abuses from within . He also held to the doctrine of synergism , which some Reformers ( Calvinists ) rejected in favor of the doctrine of monergism . His middle road ( via media ) approach disappointed , and even angered , scholars in both camps . Erasmus died suddenly in Basel in 1536 while preparing to return to Brabant and was buried in Basel Minster , the former cathedral of the city . A bronze statue of Erasmus was erected in 1622 in his city of birth , replacing an earlier work in stone",
  "/wiki/Philo": "Philo of Alexandria HaCohen ; c. 20 BCE - c. 50 CE ) , also called Philo Judaeus , was a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher who lived in Alexandria , in the Roman province of Egypt . Philo used philosophical allegory to harmonize Jewish scripture , mainly the Torah , with Greek philosophy . His method followed the practices of both Jewish exegesis and Stoic philosophy . His allegorical exegesis was important for some Christian Church Fathers , but he had very little reception history within the Rabbinic Judaism . He adopted allegorical instead of literal interpretations of the Hebrew Bible . Some scholars hold that his concept of the Logos as God 's creative principle influenced early Christology . Other scholars deny direct influence but say that Philo and Early Christianity borrow from a common source . The only event in Philo 's life that can be decisively dated is his participation in the embassy to Rome in 40 CE . He represented the Alexandrian Jews in a delegation to the Roman Emperor Gaius ( Caligula ) following civil strife between the Alexandrian Jewish and Greek communities . The story of this event , and a few other biographical details , are found in Josephus and in Philo 's own works , especially in Legatio ad Gaium ( Embassy to Gaius ) of which only two of the original five volumes survive . The thought of Philo was largely inspired by Aristobulus of Paneas and the Alexandrian School , concerning his work Wisdom of Solomon and the occupations of the Therapeut\u00e6 and the Essenes . Philo has never been claimed as a saint nor Doctor of the Church",

Basel is Switzerland 's third-most-populous city ( after Z\u00fcrich and Geneva ) with about 180,000 inhabitants . Located where the Swiss , French and German borders meet , Basel also has suburbs in France and Germany . As of 2016 [ update ] , the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland , with a population of 541,000 in 74 municipalities in Switzerland ( municipal count as of 2018 ) . The initiative Trinational Eurodistrict Basel ( TEB ) of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries , counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007 . The official language of Basel is ( the Swiss variety of Standard ) German , but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect . The city is known for its many internationally renowned museums , ranging from the Kunstmuseum , the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe ( 1661 ) and the largest museum of art in the whole of Switzerland , to the Fondation Beyeler ( located in Riehen ) . The University of Basel , Switzerland 's oldest university ( founded in 1460 ) , and the city 's centuries-long commitment to humanism , have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam , the Holbein family , Friedrich Nietzsche , and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers . The city of Basel is Switzerland 's second-largest economic centre after the city of Z\u00fcrich [ citation needed ] and has the highest GDP per capita in the country , ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva . In terms of value , over 94 % of Basel City 's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors .

  "/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius": "The major sources depicting the life and rule of Marcus are patchy and frequently unreliable . The most important group of sources , the biographies contained in the Historia Augusta , claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century AD , but it is believed they were in fact written by a single author ( referred to here as 'the biographer ' ) from about 395 AD . The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are unreliable , but the earlier biographies , derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources ( Marius Maximus or Ignotus ) , are much more accurate . For Marcus ' life and rule , the biographies of Hadrian , Antoninus , Marcus , and Lucius are largely reliable , but those of Aelius Verus and Avidius Cassius are not . A body of correspondence between Marcus ' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts , covering the period from c. 138 to 166 . Marcus ' own Meditations offer a window on his inner life , but are largely undateable and make few specific references to worldly affairs . The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio , a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books . Dio is vital for the military history of the period , but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective . Some other literary sources provide specific details : the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite , the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times , and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianeus on Marcus ' legal work . Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources",

Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement . It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium , where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180 . Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia , because internal notes tell us that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova ( modern-day Hron ) and the second book was written at Carnuntum . It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published and the work has no official title , so Meditations is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection .

His texts deal with solving algebraic equations . While reading Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac 's edition of Diophantus ' Arithmetica , Pierre de Fermat concluded that a certain equation considered by Diophantus had no solutions , and noted in the margin without elaboration that he had found a truly marvelous proof of this proposition , now referred to as Fermat 's Last Theorem . This led to tremendous advances in number theory , and the study of Diophantine equations ( Diophantine geometry ) and of Diophantine approximations remain important areas of mathematical research . Diophantus coined the term \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ( parisotes ) to refer to an approximate equality . This term was rendered as adaequalitas in Latin , and became the technique of adequality developed by Pierre de Fermat to find maxima for functions and tangent lines to curves . Diophantus was the first Greek mathematician who recognized fractions as numbers ; thus he allowed positive rational numbers for the coefficients and solutions . In modern use , Diophantine equations are usually algebraic equations with integer coefficients , for which integer solutions are sought"
