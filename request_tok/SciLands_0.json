  "/wiki/Science_Friday": "Science Friday ( known as SciFri for short ) is a weekly call-in talk show that broadcasts each Friday on public radio stations , distributed by WNYC Studios . SciFri is hosted by award-winning science journalist Ira Flatow and was created and is produced by ScienceFriday , Inc . The program is divided into two one-hour programs , with each hour ending with a complete sign-off . The focus of each program is news and information on nature , science , and technology . For most of its existence , Science Friday was a sub-program within Talk of the Nation ; it was spun off as a series in its own right when Talk of the Nation was canceled in June 2013 . Science Friday is also available in a podcasting format and is one of the most popular iTunes downloads , frequently in the top 15 downloads each week . SciFri podcasts are downloaded over 23 million times per year and over 1.3 million listeners tune in each week to hear the program . It is also carried via Sirius XM Radio . In addition to the program , SciFri creates original videos and educational materials , all available on its website . [ citation needed ] SciFri broadcasts excerpts from the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony on the Friday after Thanksgiving . Science Friday maintained an island ( Science Friday Island ) in Second Life , including an open-air theater with live audio and video feeds of the broadcast . That venue is no longer in operation",
  "/wiki/Victoria_crater": "Victoria is an impact crater on Mars located at 2.05\u00b0S , 5.50\u00b0W in the Meridiani Planum extraterrestrial plain , lying situated within the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle ( MC-19 ) region of the planet Mars . This crater was first visited by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity . It is roughly 730 metres wide , nearly eight times the size of the crater Endurance , visited by Opportunity from sols 951 to 1630 . It is informally named after Victoria - one of the five Spanish ships of Ferdinand Magellan and the first ship to circumnavigate the globe - and formally named after Victoria , Seychelles . Along the edges of the crater are many outcrops within recessed alcoves and promontories , named for bays and capes that Magellan discovered . Opportunity traveled for 21 months to Victoria before finally reaching its edge on September 26 , 2006 ( sol 951 ) , at the newly named Duck Bay . Around the rover were features dubbed No Name , Duck Crater , Emma Dean , Maid of the Canyon , and Kitty Clyde 's Sister . It also imaged several nearby alcoves , informally named Cape Verde and Cabo Frio , and a small bright crater the size of Beagle on the opposite end of Victoria",
  "/wiki/NASA": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA , /\u02c8n\u00e6s\u0259/ ) is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government responsible for the civilian space program , as well as aeronautics and aerospace research . [ note 1 ] NASA was established in 1958 , succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) . The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation , encouraging peaceful applications in space science . Since its establishment , most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA , including the Apollo Moon landing missions , the Skylab space station , and later the Space Shuttle . NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles . The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches . NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System ; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate 's Heliophysics Research Program ; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons ; and researching astrophysics topics , such as the Big Bang , through the Great Observatories and associated programs",
  "/wiki/Mars": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury . In English , Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet ' . The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars ' surface , which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye . Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere , having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys , deserts , and polar ice caps of Earth . The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth , because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar . Mars is the site of Olympus Mons , the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System , and of Valles Marineris , one of the largest canyons in the Solar System . The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40 % of the planet and may be a giant impact feature . Mars has two moons , Phobos and Deimos , which are small and irregularly shaped . These may be captured asteroids , similar to 5261 Eureka , a Mars trojan . Mars has been explored by numerous unmanned spacecraft . Mariner 4 , launched by NASA on November 28 , 1964 , was the first spacecraft to visit Mars , making its closest approach to the planet on July 15 , 1965 . Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt , measured at about 0.1 % that of Earths , and captured the first images of another planet from deep space",
  "/wiki/NOAA": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA , /\u02c8no\u028a.\u0259/ like Noah ) is an American scientific agency within the United States Department of Commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans , major waterways , and the atmosphere . NOAA warns of dangerous weather , charts seas , guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources , and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the environment"
