The original Chrysler Corporation was founded in 1925 by Walter Chrysler from the remains of the Maxwell Motor Company . In 1998 , it was acquired by Daimler-Benz , and the holding company was renamed DaimlerChrysler . After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007 , the company existed as Chrysler LLC ( 2007-2009 ) and Chrysler Group LLC ( 2009-2014 ) before merging in 2014 with Italian holding company Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of its successor Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . In addition to the Chrysler brand , FCA sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge , Jeep , and Ram nameplates . Furthermore , the subsidiary includes Mopar , its automotive parts and accessories division , and SRT , its performance automobile division . After founding the company , Walter Chrysler used the General Motors brand diversification and hierarchy strategy that he had seen working for Buick , and acquired Fargo Trucks and Dodge Brothers , and created the Plymouth and DeSoto brands in 1928 . Facing postwar declines in market share , productivity , and profitability , as GM and Ford were growing , Chrysler borrowed $ 250 million in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs . Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French , British and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s ; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn for $ 1 . The company struggled to adapt to changing markets , increased U.S. import competition , and safety and environmental regulation in the 1970s . It began an engineering partnership with Mitsubishi Motors , and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America . On the verge of bankruptcy in the late 1970s , it was saved by $ 1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government",

Later in the same year , he won the Breeders ' Cup Classic and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and American Horse of the Year .

After his retirement from racing , Sunday Silence attracted little support by breeders in the United States and was exported to Japan . He was Leading Sire in Japan on thirteen occasions , surpassing the previous record of ten titles by Northern Taste . Although the relatively insular nature of Japanese racing at the time meant that Sunday Silence 's success was initially restricted to his home territory , his descendants have in recent years won major races in Australia , France , the United Kingdom , Hong Kong , the United States and Dubai . Blood-Horse pedigree expert Anne Peters speculated , Had Sunday Silence retired in Kentucky , it 's almost certain he would have tanked commercially and been exported in disgrace , but he found his perfect gene pool and thrived instead .

The injury ruined any chance of a Triple Crown in 2006 and ended his racing career . The next day , he underwent surgery at the New Bolton Center at the University of Pennsylvania for his injuries . In July he developed laminitis in his left rear foot . He was rushed to the hospital , where he underwent five further operations , and his prognosis varied during an exceptionally long stay in the Equine Intensive Care Unit at the New Bolton Center .
