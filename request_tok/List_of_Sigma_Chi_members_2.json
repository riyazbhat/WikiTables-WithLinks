  "/wiki/St._Louis_Rams": "In 1995 , the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League relocated the franchise from southern California to the Midwestern United States , moving to St. Louis , Missouri and becoming known as the St. Louis Rams .

The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers .

  "/wiki/Tight_End": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary .

  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play",

  "/wiki/All-Pro": "All-Pro is an honor bestowed upon professional American football players that designates the best player at each position during a given season . All-Pro players are typically selected by press organizations , who select an All-Pro team , a list that consists of at least 22 players , one for each offensive and defensive position , plus various special teams players depending on the press organization that compiles the list . All-Pro lists are exclusively limited to the major leagues , usually only the National Football League ; in the past , other leagues recognized as major , such as the American Football League of the 1960s or the All-America Football Conference of the 1940s , have been included in All-Pro lists . Beginning in the early 1920s , All-Pro teams have traditionally been assembled from press polls of individually voting sportswriters . After polling the writers , the votes are tallied to determine the selected players and the results have historically been published through various news syndicates . Today , the teams are mostly published online or announced on various televised sports programs . Some organizations publish two All-Pro lists , a First Team and a Second Team , with the first consisting of more prominent players than the second . The Associated Press ( AP ) and its All-Pro selections are the most widely recognized today . Other polls include the United Press International All-Pro poll , which began in the 1940s and continued in various forms until 1997 , the Newspaper Enterprise Association All-Pro team , which ran from 1954 until 1996 , and the Pro Football Writers Association All-Pro teams , which were inaugurated in 1966 and continue to be released annually . The NFL itself compiled official All-Pro lists beginning in 1931 but abandoned the practice in 1942 . The All-Pro designation , while not officially sanctioned by the NFL , is generally considered a more prestigious honor than the NFL 's official all-star designation , a Pro Bowl recognition : a minimum of twice as many Pro Bowlers are selected as first and second team All-Pro slots combined , and Pro Bowl selections often drop out , allowing a lesser player to also receive the honor by default , which does not occur with the All-Pro list",

The NFLPA is a member of the AFL-CIO , the largest federation of unions in the United States . In the early years of the NFL , contractual negotiations took place between individual players and management ; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining . A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union 's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners . League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation ; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA . However , the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968 , when a CBA was signed . The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011 . In addition to conducting labor negotiations , the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players ; the organization 's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe .
