  "/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty": "The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty , commonly known as the National Trust , is an independent charity and membership organisation for environmental and heritage conservation in England , Wales and Northern Ireland . The trust describes itself as a charity that works to preserve and protect historic places and spaces - for ever , for everyone . The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen . In Scotland , there is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland . The National Trust has a unique special power to prevent its inalienable land being sold off , although this can be over-ridden by Parliamentary procedure . The National Trust has been the beneficiary of many large donations and bequests . It owns over 500 heritage properties , which include many historic houses and gardens , industrial monuments , and social history sites . Most of these are open to the public , usually for a charge . Others are leased to tenants on terms that manage to preserve their character whilst providing for more limited public access . The Trust is one of the largest private landowners in the United Kingdom , owning over 248,000 hectares ( 610,000 acres ; 2,480 km2 ; 960 sq mi ) of land",
