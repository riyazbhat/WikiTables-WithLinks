Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity ; however , some still use it as a means of transportation . Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved , sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport . Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing , from which all skiing disciplines evolved , including alpine skiing , ski jumping and Telemark skiing . Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward ( classic style ) or side-to-side in a skating motion ( skate skiing ) , aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow . It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes , including Northern Europe , Canada , Russia , the United States , Australia and New Zealand . Competitive cross-country skiing is one of the Nordic skiing sports . Cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship are the two components of biathlon , ski-orienteering is a form of cross-country skiing , which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks .",

The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) .

  "/wiki/Sailing": "Sailing employs the wind - acting on sails , wingsails or kites - to propel a craft on the surface of the water ( sailing ship , sailboat , windsurfer , or kitesurfer ) , on ice ( iceboat ) or on land ( land yacht ) over a chosen course , which is often part of a larger plan of navigation . A course defined with respect to the true wind direction is called a point of sail . Conventional sailing craft can not derive power from sails on a point of sail that is too close into the wind . On a given point of sail , the sailor adjusts the alignment of each sail with respect to the apparent wind direction ( as perceived on the craft ) to mobilize the power of the wind . The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull , keel , and rudder of a sailing craft , by forces from skate runners of an iceboat , or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course . In the 21st century , most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport . Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising . Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips , coastal sailing within sight of land , and daysailing . Until the mid of the 19th century , sailing ships were the primary means for marine commerce , this period is known as Age of Sail .",

  "/wiki/Athletics_(sport)": "Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running , jumping , throwing , and walking . The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field , road running , cross country running , and race walking . The results of racing events are decided by finishing position ( or time , where measured ) , while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts . The simplicity of the competitions , and the lack of a need for expensive equipment , makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world . Athletics is mostly an individual sport , with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes ' performances for a team score , such as cross country . Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC . The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century , and were then spread to other parts of the world . Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics , the global governing body for the sport of athletics , or its member continental and national federations .

  "/wiki/Figure_skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions ."
