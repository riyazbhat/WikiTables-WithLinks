It currently has four members : the Arizona Cardinals , the Los Angeles Rams , the San Francisco 49ers , and the Seattle Seahawks . The division was formed in 1967 as the National Football League Coastal Division , keeping with the theme of having all of the league 's divisions starting with the letter C. The division was so named because its teams were fairly close to the coasts of the United States , although they were on opposite coasts , making for long travel between division rivals . The NFL Coastal Division had four members : Atlanta Falcons , Baltimore Colts , Los Angeles Rams , and San Francisco 49ers . Los Angeles and San Francisco occupied the West Coast , while Baltimore maintained its dominance over the lesser teams that remained in the division . After the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 , the division was renamed the NFC West . The Baltimore Colts moved to the AFC East and were replaced by the New Orleans Saints . In 1976 , the newly formed Seattle Seahawks spent one season in this division before moving to the AFC West . Except for that one year , the division remained the same until 1995 with the addition of the new Carolina Panthers team . The Rams moved to St. Louis before that same season , making the division geographically inaccurate . Ten of the fifteen NFC teams were based west of Atlanta , and twelve of them were based west of Charlotte . The 2002 re-alignment changed the entire look of the NFC West .",

The second began in 1983 and ended in 1998 . During this period , the Broncos had just two losing seasons , were AFC champions five times and were Super Bowl champions for two consecutive years . This second period of success is best remembered for John Elway being the team 's quarterback . The most recent run of success began in 2011 , lasting until their victory in Super Bowl 50 at the end of the 2015 season .

After losing in the Divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons , the Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented West coast offense with zone blocking to blend in with Manning 's shotgun passing style , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line . Manning missed six games due to a partial tear of the plantar fascia in his left foot and had his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 . Backup quarterback Brock Osweiler filled in for Manning during the second half of the regular season , before Manning re-claimed the starting quarterback position prior to the team 's postseason run .
