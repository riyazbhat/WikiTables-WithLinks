  "/wiki/Confederate_States_Army": "The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America ( commonly referred to as the Confederacy ) during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , fighting against the United States forces . On February 28 , 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president , Jefferson Davis . Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War . He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce . On March 1 , 1861 , on behalf of the Confederate government , Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston , South Carolina , where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , held by a small U.S. Army garrison . By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons . Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war , they do not represent the size of the army at any given date . These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy . Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer . In the absence of exact records , estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts",

Most Confederate generals needed confirmation from the Confederate Congress , much like prospective generals in the modern U.S. armed forces .

  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

  "/wiki/Department_of_the_Tennessee": "The Army of the Tennessee was a Union army in the Western Theater of the American Civil War , named for the Tennessee River . It appears that the term Army of the Tennessee was first used within the Union Army in March 1862 , to describe Union forces perhaps more properly described as the Army of West Tennessee ; these were the troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in the Union 's District of West Tennessee . In April 1862 , Grant 's troops survived a severe test in the bloody Battle of Shiloh . Then , during six months marked by discouragement and anxiety for Grant , his army first joined with two other Union armies to prosecute the relatively bloodless Siege of Corinth and then strained to hold Union positions in Tennessee and Mississippi . In October 1862 , Grant 's command was reconfigured and elevated to departmental status , as the Department of the Tennessee ; the title of his command was thus officially aligned with that of his army . Grant commanded these forces until after his critically important victory at Vicksburg on July 4 , 1863 . Under other generals , starting with William Tecumseh Sherman , the army marched and fought from the Chattanooga Campaign , through the Relief of Knoxville , the Meridian Campaign , the Atlanta Campaign , the March to the Sea , the Carolinas Campaign , and to the end of the war and disbandment . This article also discusses Grant 's 1861-1862 commands - the District of Southeast Missouri and the District of Cairo - because the troops Grant led in the Battle of Belmont and the Henry-Donelson campaign during that period became the nucleus of the Army of the Tennessee . A 2005 study of the army states that it was present at most of the great battles that became turning points of the war - Fort Donelson , Vicksburg , and Atlanta and won the decisive battles in the decisive theater of the war . More poetically , in 1867 , apparently speaking of the Atlanta campaign , General Sherman said that the Army of the Tennessee was never checked - always victorious ; so rapid in motion - so eager to strike ; it deserved its name of the 'Whip-lash , ' swung from one flank to the other , as danger called , night or day , sunshine or storm",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places .

After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei , the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895 . The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty 's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty , especially when compared with Japan 's successful Meiji Restoration . For the first time , regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan ; the prestige of the Qing dynasty , along with the classical tradition in China , suffered a major blow .

While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna , the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation . The Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree , declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such , being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag . Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico , establishing the Republic of Texas , and eventually being annexed by the United States . The revolution began in October 1835 , after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas . The Mexican government had become increasingly centralized and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed , particularly regarding immigration from the United States . Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the Mexican Constitution of 1824 . While delegates at the Consultation ( provisional government ) debated the war 's motives , Texians and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835 . The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government , whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas . An ill-conceived proposal to invade Matamoros siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling Texian Army . In March 1836 , a second political convention declared independence and appointed leadership for the new Republic of Texas .
