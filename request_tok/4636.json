  "/wiki/Cumbric_language": "Cumbric was a variety of the Common Brittonic language spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the Hen Ogledd or Old North in what is now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland . It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages . Place name evidence suggests Cumbric may also have been spoken as far south as Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales . The prevailing view is that it became extinct in the 12th century , after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Celtic_languages": "The Celtic languages ( usually /\u02c8k\u025blt\u026ak/ , but sometimes /\u02c8s\u025blt\u026ak/ ) are a group of related languages descended from Proto-Celtic . They form a branch of the Indo-European language family . The term Celtic was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707 , following Paul-Yves Pezron , who made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages . During the 1st millennium BC , Celtic languages were spoken across much of Europe and in Asia Minor . Today , they are restricted to the northwestern fringe of Europe and a few diaspora communities . There are four living languages : Welsh , Breton , Irish and Scottish Gaelic . All are minority languages in their respective countries , though there are continuing efforts at revitalisation . Welsh is an official language in Wales and Irish is an official language of Ireland and of the European Union . Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as endangered by UNESCO . The Cornish and Manx languages went extinct in modern times . They have been the object of revivals and now each has several hundred second-language speakers . Irish , Scottish and Manx form the Goidelic languages , while Welsh , Cornish and Breton are Brittonic .",
  "/wiki/Jewish_Babylonian_Aramaic": "Jewish Babylonian Aramaic was the form of Middle Aramaic employed by writers in Lower Mesopotamia between the fourth and eleventh centuries . It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian Talmud ( which was completed in the seventh century ) and of post-Talmudic ( Geonic ) literature , which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Jews . The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of inscriptions on incantation bowls .",
  "/wiki/Semitic_languages": "The Semitic languages , previously also named Syro-Arabian languages , are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family originating in the Middle East that are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of Western Asia , North Africa and the Horn of Africa , as well as in often large immigrant and expatriate communities in North America , Europe and Australasia . The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the G\u00f6ttingen School of History , who derived the name from Shem , one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis . The most widely spoken Semitic languages today are ( numbers given are for native speakers only ) Arabic ( 300 million ) , Amharic ( ~65 million ) , Tigrinya ( 7 million ) , Hebrew ( ~5 million native/L1 speakers ) , Tigre ( ~1.05 million ) , Aramaic ( 575,000 to 1 million largely Assyrian fluent speakers ) and Maltese ( 483,000 speakers ) . Semitic languages occur in written form from a very early historical date , with East Semitic Akkadian and Eblaite texts ( written in a script adapted from Sumerian cuneiform ) appearing from the 30th century BCE and the 25th century BCE in Mesopotamia and the northern Levant respectively . The only earlier attested languages are Sumerian , Elamite ( 2800 BCE to 550 BCE ) ( both language isolates ) , Egyptian and unclassified Lullubi from the 30th century BCE . Most scripts used to write Semitic languages are abjads - a type of alphabetic script that omits some or all of the vowels , which is feasible for these languages because the consonants in the Semitic languages are the primary carriers of meaning . Among them are the Ugaritic , Phoenician , Aramaic , Hebrew , Syriac , Arabic , and South Arabian alphabets . The Ge'ez script , used for writing the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea , is technically an abugida - a modified abjad in which vowels are notated using diacritic marks added to the consonants at all times , in contrast with other Semitic languages which indicate diacritics based on need or for introductory purposes . Maltese is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script and the only Semitic language to be an official language of the European Union . The Semitic languages are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology . That is , word roots are not themselves syllables or words , but instead are isolated sets of consonants ( usually three , making a so-called triliteral root ) . Words are composed out of roots not so much by adding prefixes or suffixes , but rather by filling in the vowels between the root consonants ( although prefixes and suffixes are often added as well ) .",

The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , historically known as Mesopotamia , is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation . It was here that mankind first began to read , write , create laws and live in cities under an organised government - notably Uruk , from which Iraq is derived . The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC . Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian , Sumerian , Assyrian and Babylonian empires .",

  "/wiki/Turkic_languages": "The Turkic languages are a language family of at least 35 documented languages , spoken by the Turkic peoples of Eurasia from Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , Central Asia and West Asia all the way to North Asia ( particularly in Siberia ) and East Asia . The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning Western China to Mongolia , where Proto-Turkic is thought to have been spoken , from where they expanded to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium . Turkic languages are spoken as a native language by some 170 million people , and the total number of Turkic speakers , including second language speakers , is over 200 million . The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish , spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans ; its native speakers account for about 40 % of all Turkic speakers . Characteristic features such as vowel harmony , agglutination , and lack of grammatical gender , are universal within the Turkic family . There is also a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages , which include Turkish , Azerbaijani , Turkmen , Qashqai , Gagauz , Balkan Gagauz Turkish and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar . Although methods of classification vary , the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches : Oghur , the only surviving member of which is Chuvash , and Common Turkic , which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch . Turkic languages show some similarities with the Mongolic , Tungusic , Koreanic and Japonic languages . These similarities led some linguists to propose an Altaic language family , though this proposal is widely rejected by historical linguists . Apparent similarities with the Uralic languages even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the Ural-Altaic hypothesis . However , there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies , the shared characteristics between the languages being attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact .",

It is also colloquially referred to as the stans as the countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix -stan , meaning land of . In pre-Islamic and early Islamic times , Central Asia was predominantly Iranian , populated by Eastern Iranian-speaking Bactrians , Sogdians , Chorasmians and the semi-nomadic Scythians and Dahae . After expansion by Turkic peoples , Central Asia also became the homeland for the Kazakhs , Uzbeks , Tatars , Turkmen , Kyrgyz , and Uyghurs ; Turkic languages largely replaced the Iranian languages spoken in the area . Central Asia has historically been closely tied to its nomadic peoples and the Silk Road . It has acted as a crossroads for the movement of people , goods , and ideas between Europe , Western Asia , South Asia , and East Asia . The Silk Road connected Muslim lands with the people of Europe , India , and China . This crossroads position has intensified the conflict between tribalism and traditionalism and modernization . From the mid-19th century until almost the end of the 20th century , most of Central Asia was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union , both Slavic-majority countries , and the five former Soviet -stans are still home to about 7 million ethnic Russians and 500,000 Ukrainians .

  "/wiki/Lombardic_language": "Lombardic or Langobardic is an extinct West Germanic language that was spoken by the Lombards ( Langobardi ) , the Germanic people who settled in Italy in the sixth century . It was already rapidly declining by the seventh century because the invaders quickly adopted the Latin vernacular spoken by the local Gallo-Roman population . Lombardic may have been in use in scattered areas until as late as c. 1000 AD . A number of place names in the Lombardy Region in Northern Italy and items of Lombard vocabulary derive from Lombardic . Some linguists have argued that the modern Cimbrian and Mocheno varieties in Northeast Italy , usually classified as Bavarian , are in fact surviving Lombard remnants .

The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8 % of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11 % of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] .
