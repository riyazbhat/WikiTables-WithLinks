  "/wiki/Film_noir": "Film noir ( /nw\u0251\u02d0r/ ; French : [ film nwa\u0281 ] ) is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas , particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations . The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the classic period of American film noir . Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key , black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography . Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression . The term film noir , French for black film ( literal ) or dark film ( closer meaning ) , was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic Nino Frank in 1946 , but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era . Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively . Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s , many of the classic film noir [ a ] were referred to as melodramas . Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct genre is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars . Film noir encompasses a range of plots : the central figure may be a private investigator ( The Big Sleep ) , a plainclothes policeman ( The Big Heat ) , an aging boxer ( The Set-Up ) , a hapless grifter ( Night and the City ) , a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime ( Gun Crazy ) , or simply a victim of circumstance ( D.O.A. ) . Although film noir was originally associated with American productions , the term has been used to describe films from around the world . Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noirs of the classical period , and often treat its conventions self-referentially . Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir .",

After his release from jail , while looking for a job as a club singer , the young man meets a musical promoter who helps him launch his career . As he develops his musical abilities and becomes a star , his self-centered personality begins to affect his relationships . The wife of producer Pandro S.

Berman hired Richard Thorpe , who was known for shooting productions quickly . The production of Jailhouse Rock began on May 13 , 1957 , and concluded on June 17 of that year . The dance sequence to the film 's title song Jailhouse Rock is often cited as Presley 's greatest moment on screen . Before pre-production began , songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber were commissioned to integrate the film 's soundtrack . In April , Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show the progress of the repertoire .

His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations , made him enormously popular - and controversial .
