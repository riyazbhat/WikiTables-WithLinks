  "/wiki/Metre": "The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) ( from the French unit m\u00e8tre , from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd , measure ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) . The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second . The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth 's circumference is approximately 40,000 km . In 1799 , the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar ( the actual bar used was changed in 1889 ) . In 1960 , the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . In 1983 , the current definition was adopted",
  "/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)": "The foot ( pl . feet ; abbreviation : ft ; symbol : \u2032 , the prime symbol ) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement . Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959 , one foot is defined as 0.3048 meter exactly . In customary and imperial units , the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard . Historically the foot was a part of many local systems of units , including the Greek , Roman , Chinese , French , and English systems . It varied in length from country to country , from city to city , and sometimes from trade to trade . Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally , but not always , subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits . The United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot ( a customary unit of length ) in preference to the meter in its commercial , engineering , and standards activities . The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom ; road signs must use imperial units ( however , distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards , not feet ) , while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height . The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement . The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world . The length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 ( UK ) , 14 ( US male ) , 15.5 ( US female ) or 47 ( EU sizing )",

Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park Reserve in southwestern Yukon , less than 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of the Yukon-Alaska border . Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan glaciers . Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth ( many shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass ) , including a massif with eleven peaks over 5,000 metres ( 16,400 ft ) . Due to active tectonic uplifting , Mount Logan is still rising in height . Before 1992 , the exact elevation of Mount Logan was unknown and measurements ranged from 5,959 to 6,050 metres ( 19,551 to 19,849 ft ) . In May 1992 , a GSC expedition climbed Mount Logan and fixed the current height of 5,959 metres ( 19,551 ft ) using GPS . Temperatures are extremely low on and near Mount Logan . On the 5,000-metre-high ( 16,000 ft ) plateau , air temperature hovers around \u221245 \u00b0C ( \u221249 \u00b0F ) in the winter and reaches near freezing in summer with the median temperature for the year around \u221227 \u00b0C ( \u221217 \u00b0F ) .

The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) .

The northern terminus is near the Liard River , while the southernmost point is near Albuquerque , adjacent the Sandia-Manzano Mountains . Located within the North American Cordillera , the Rockies are distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges , Cascade Range , and the Sierra Nevada , which all lie farther to the west . The Rocky Mountains formed 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny , in which a number of plates began sliding underneath the North American plate . The angle of subduction was shallow , resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America . Since then , further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys . At the end of the last ice age , humans began inhabiting the mountain range . After Europeans , such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie , and Americans , such as the Lewis and Clark expedition , began exploring the range , minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains , although the range itself never experienced a dense population . Of the 100 highest peaks in the Rocky Mountains , 78 ( including the 30 highest ) are located in Colorado , ten in Wyoming , six in New Mexico , and three in Montana .

Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land .

The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) defines the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division as consisting of thirteen provinces : the Atlantic Coast Uplands , Eastern Newfoundland Atlantic , Maritime Acadian Highlands , Maritime Plain , Notre Dame and M\u00e9gantic Mountains , Western Newfoundland Mountains , Piedmont , Blue Ridge , Valley and Ridge , Saint Lawrence Valley , Appalachian Plateaus , New England province , and the Adirondack areas . A common variant definition does not include the Adirondack Mountains , which geologically belong to the Grenville Orogeny and have a different geological history from the rest of the Appalachians",
  "/wiki/Ontario": "Ontario is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada . Located in Central Canada , it is Canada 's most populous province , with 38.3 percent of the country 's population , and is the second-largest province in total area . Ontario is fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included . It is home to the nation 's capital city , Ottawa , and the nation 's most populous city , Toronto , which is also Ontario 's provincial capital . Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west , Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north , and Quebec to the east and northeast , and to the south by the U.S. states of ( from west to east ) Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York . Almost all of Ontario 's 2,700 km ( 1,678 mi ) border with the United States follows inland waterways : from the westerly Lake of the Woods , eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system . These include Rainy River , Pigeon River , Lake Superior , St. Marys River , Lake Huron , St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , Detroit River , Lake Erie , Niagara River , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston , Ontario , to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall , Ontario . There is only about 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) of land border , made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border . Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions , Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario . The great majority of Ontario 's population and arable land is in the south . In contrast , the larger , northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation",
  "/wiki/Ishpatina_Ridge": "Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point of land in the Canadian province of Ontario , at an estimated 693 m ( 2,274 ft ) above sea level . Ishpatina Ridge rises approximately 300 m ( 984 ft ) above the immediate area . It was only truly recognized as Ontario 's highest point after federal government topographical mapping revealed this fact in the 1970s . Before then , the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher . The ridge lies in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park . Due to its remote location , Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach . The closest major highway , Highway 560 , is more than 30 km north . There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area , but they are difficult to travel in poor weather . The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the town of Capreol north of Sudbury . While a northern route exists ( out of Gowganda , the nearest community ) , there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous . This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe . Historically , a fire tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane",

  "/wiki/Nova_Scotia": "Nova Scotia ( /no\u028av\u0259 \u02c8sko\u028a\u0283\u0259/ ) is a province in eastern Canada . With a population of 923,598 as of 2016 , it is the most populous of Canada 's three Maritime provinces and the four Atlantic provinces . It is the country 's second most-densely populated province and second-smallest province by area , both after neighbouring Prince Edward Island . Its area of 55,284 square kilometres ( 21,345 sq mi ) includes Cape Breton Island and 3,800 other coastal islands . The peninsula that makes up Nova Scotia 's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the Isthmus of Chignecto , on which the province 's land border with New Brunswick is located . The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east , and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits , respectively . The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years . France 's first settlement in North America , Port-Royal , was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of Acadia for over a hundred years . The Fortress of Louisbourg was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area , changing hands numerous times in the until France relinquished its claims with the Treaty of Paris in 1763 . During the American Revolutionary War , thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia . In 1848 , Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government , and it federated in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada ( now Ontario and Quebec ) to form what is now the country of Canada . Nova Scotia 's capital and largest city is Halifax , which is today home to about 45 per cent of the province 's population , is the thirteenth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada , the largest city in Atlantic Canada , and Canadas second largest coastal city ( after Vancouver )",

  "/wiki/Cape_Breton_Highlands": "The Cape Breton Highlands , commonly called the Highlands , refer to a highland or mountainous plateau across the northern part of Cape Breton Island in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia . Considered an extension of the Appalachian mountain chain , the Highlands comprise the northern portions of Inverness and Victoria counties . The Highlands are surrounded by water with the Atlantic Ocean on the east , the Cabot Strait to the north and east , the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the north and west , and Bras d'Or Lake to the south . Elevations average 350 metres at the edges of the plateau ( i.e . at the above-mentioned water bodies ) , and rise to more than 500 metres at the centre , including the highest elevation point in the province at White Hill . The plateau consists of numerous broad , gently rolling hills bisected with deep valleys and steep-walled river canyons . The southern and western edges of the plateau give way to broad valleys with soils resulting from glaciation , providing some of Cape Breton 's best agricultural lands . Most of the interior and southern edges of the plateau are covered with damp , cool deciduous forests which makes for spectacular colours during autumn foliage . Southward facing slopes above 300 metres in elevation generally only support Balsam Fir , as a result of the short growing season and harsh winter climate . The northern and western edges of the plateau , particularly at high elevations , resemble arctic tundra . The west coast of the Highlands meets the Gulf of St. Lawrence in steep cliffs whereas the east coast borders the Atlantic Ocean with a gently sloping coastal plain , low headlands , and several beaches . In 1936 the federal government established the Cape Breton Highlands National Park covering 950 km\u00b2 across the northern third of the Highlands",

Other important industries include the fisheries , tourism , aerospace , bio-science , IT , and renewable energy . The island has several informal names : Garden of the Gulf , referring to the pastoral scenery and lush agricultural lands throughout the province ; and Birthplace of Confederation or Cradle of Confederation , referring to the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 , although PEI did not join Confederation until 1873 , when it became the seventh Canadian province . Historically , PEI is one of Canada 's older settlements and demographically still reflects older immigration to the country , with Scottish , Irish , English and French surnames being dominant .
