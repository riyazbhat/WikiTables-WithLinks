  "/wiki/Jon_Appleton": "Jon Howard Appleton ( born January 4 , 1939 ) is an American composer and teacher who was a pioneer in electro-acoustic music . His earliest compositions in the medium , e.g . Chef d'Oeuvre and Newark Airport Rock attracted attention because they established a new tradition some have called programmatic electronic music . In 1970 he won Guggenheim , Fulbright and American-Scandinavian Foundation fellowships . When he was twenty-eight years old he joined the faculty of Dartmouth College where he established one of the first electronic music studios in the United States . He remained there intermittently for forty-two years . In the mid-1970s he left Dartmouth to briefly become the head of Elektronmusikstudion ( EMS ) in Stockholm , Sweden . In the late 1970s , together with Sydney Alonso and Cameron Jones he helped develop the first commercial digital synthesizer called the Synclavier . For a decade he toured around the United States and Europe performing the compositions he composed for this instrument . In the early 1990s he helped found the Theremin Center for Electronic Music at the Moscow Conservatory of Music where he continues to teach once a year . He has also taught at Keio University ( Mita ) in Tokyo , Japan , CCRMA at Stanford University and the University of California Santa Cruz . In his later years he has devoted most of his time to the composition of instrumental and choral music in a quasi-Romantic vein which has largely been performed only in France , Russia and Japan .",

  "/wiki/King_Crimson": "King Crimson are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 . King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and many contemporary artists . Although the band has undergone numerous formations throughout its history , Robert Fripp is the only consistent member of the group and is considered the band 's leader and driving force . The band has earned a large cult following . They were ranked No . 87 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock . Although considered to be a seminal progressive rock band ( a genre characterised by extended instrumental sections and complex song structures ) , they have often distanced themselves from the genre : as well as influencing several generations of progressive and psychedelic rock bands , they have also been an influence on subsequent alternative metal , hardcore and experimental/noise musicians . Developed from the unsuccessful psychedelic pop trio Giles , Giles and Fripp , the initial King Crimson were key to the formation of early progressive rock , strongly influencing and altering the music of contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis . Their debut album , In the Court of the Crimson King ( 1969 ) , remains their most successful and influential release , with its elements of jazz , classical and experimental music . Their success increased following an opening act performance for the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park , London , in 1969 . Following In the Wake of Poseidon ( 1970 ) and the less successful chamber jazz-inspired Lizard ( 1970 ) , and Islands ( 1971 ) , the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation ( swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion ) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation , reaching a new creative peak on Larks ' Tongues in Aspic ( 1973 ) , Starless and Bible Black ( 1974 ) and Red ( 1974 ) . Fripp disbanded the group in 1974 .",

  "/wiki/Cherry_Poppin'_Daddies": "The Cherry Poppin ' Daddies are an American swing and ska band established in Eugene , Oregon , in 1989 . Formed by singer-songwriter Steve Perry and bassist Dan Schmid , the band has experienced numerous personnel changes over the course of their thirty year career , with only Perry , Schmid and trumpeter Dana Heitman currently remaining from the original founding line-up . The Daddies ' music is primarily a mix of swing and ska , contrastingly encompassing both traditional jazz-influenced variations of the genres as well as contemporary rock and punk hybrids , characterized by a prominent horn section and Perry 's acerbic and innuendo-laced lyricism often concerning dark or political subject matter . While the band 's earliest releases were mostly grounded in punk and funk rock , their later studio albums have since incorporated elements from many diverse genres of popular music and Americana into their sound , including rockabilly , rhythm and blues , soul and world music . Initially drawing both acclaim and controversy as a preeminent regional band , the Daddies gained wider recognition touring nationally within the American ska scene before ultimately breaking into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot . Released at the onset of the late 1990s swing revival , Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit , launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement . By the end of the decade , however , interest in the swing revival had swiftly declined , along with the band 's commercial popularity . The resultant failure of their subsequent album Soul Caddy contributed to an abrupt hiatus in 2000 . The Daddies officially regrouped in 2002 to resume part-time touring , eventually returning to recording with the independently released Susquehanna in 2008 . Their eleventh album , the punk and ska-influenced Bigger Life , was released in June 2019 .",
