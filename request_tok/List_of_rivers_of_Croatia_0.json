It flows through Slovenia , Croatia , along the northern border of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and through Serbia , discharging into the Danube in Belgrade . Its central part is a natural border of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia . The Sava forms the northern border of the Balkan Peninsula , and the southern edge of the Pannonian Plain . The Sava is 990 kilometres ( 615 miles ) long , including the 45-kilometre ( 28 mi ) Sava Dolinka headwater rising in Zelenci , Slovenia . It is the greatest tributary of the Danube by volume of water , and second-largest after Tisza in terms of catchment area ( 97,713 square kilometres ( 37,727 square miles ) ) and length . It drains a significant portion of the Dinaric Alps region , through the major tributaries of Drina , Bosna , Kupa , Una , Vrbas , Lonja , Kolubara , Bosut and Krka . The Sava is one of the longest rivers in Europe and among a handful of European rivers of that length that do not drain directly into a sea . The population in the Sava River basin is estimated at 8,176,000 , and it connects three national capitals - Ljubljana , Zagreb and Belgrade . The Sava is navigable for larger vessels from the confluence of the Kupa River in Sisak , Croatia , approximately two-thirds of its length . The name is believed to be derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *sewh1 ( 'to take liquid ' , whence the English word sup ) and the ending *eh2 , so that it literally means 'that which waters [ the ground ] '",
  "/wiki/Danube": "The Danube ( /\u02c8d\u00e6n.ju\u02d0b/ DAN-yoob ; known by various names in other languages ) is Europe 's second longest river , after the Volga . It is located in Central and Eastern Europe . The Danube was once a long-standing frontier of the Roman Empire , and today flows through 10 countries , more than any other river in the world . Originating in Germany , the Danube flows southeast for 2,850 km ( 1,770 mi ) , passing through or bordering Austria , Slovakia , Hungary , Croatia , Serbia , Romania , Bulgaria , Moldova and Ukraine before draining into the Black Sea . Its drainage basin extends into nine more countries . The Danube river basin is home to fish species such as pike , zander , huchen , Wels catfish , burbot and tench . It is also home to a large diversity of carp and sturgeon , as well as salmon and trout . A few species of euryhaline fish , such as European seabass , mullet , and eel , inhabit the Danube Delta and the lower portion of the river . Since ancient times , the Danube has become a traditional trade route in Europe . Today , 2,415 km ( 1,501 mi ) of its total length are navigable . The river is also an important source of hydropower and drinking water",

The Black Sea has an area of 436,400 km2 ( 168,500 sq mi ) ( not including the Sea of Azov ) , a maximum depth of 2,212 m ( 7,257 ft ) , and a volume of 547,000 km3 ( 131,000 cu mi ) .

The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine , Romania , Bulgaria , Turkey , Georgia , and Russia . It has a positive water balance ; that is , a net outflow of water 300 km3 ( 72 cu mi ) per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea . There is a two-way hydrological exchange : the more saline and therefore denser , but warmer , Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow . This creates a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters . The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea , via the Aegean Sea and various straits , and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean",

The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Italy , Montenegro and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands , mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) in summer to 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate . The Adriatic Sea sits on the Apulian or Adriatic Microplate , which separated from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era .
