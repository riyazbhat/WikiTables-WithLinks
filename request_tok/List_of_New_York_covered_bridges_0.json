  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Irene_(2011)": "Hurricane Irene was a large and destructive tropical cyclone which affected much of the Caribbean and East Coast of the United States during late August 2011 . The ninth named storm , first hurricane , and first major hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season , Irene originated from a well-defined Atlantic tropical wave that began showing signs of organization east of the Lesser Antilles . Due to development of atmospheric convection and a closed center of circulation , the system was designated as Tropical Storm Irene on August 20 , 2011 . After intensifying , Irene made landfall in St. Croix as a strong tropical storm later that day . Early on August 21 , the storm made a second landfall in Puerto Rico . While crossing the island , Irene strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane . The storm paralleled offshore of Hispaniola , continuing to slowly intensify in the process . Shortly before making four landfalls in the Bahamas , Irene peaked as a 120 mph ( 190 km/h ) Category 3 hurricane . Thereafter , the storm slowly leveled off in intensity as it struck the Bahamas and then curved northward after passing east of Grand Bahama . Continuing to weaken , Irene was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina on August 27 , becoming the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Ike in 2008 . Early on the following day , the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic from southeastern Virginia .

The river has been popular as a trout stream since the early 19th century , when it became one of the first resort destinations in the United States . The subsequent depletion of the brook trout population by the 1850s led to an early conservation movement to preserve the river , including the introduction of hatcheries for brown trout . Its popularity as a trout stream arises in part from the many cold springs and deep pools in the upper river that keep the water at an even cold temperature .
