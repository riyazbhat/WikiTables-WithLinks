  "/wiki/Oberleutnant_zur_See": "Oberleutnant zur See ( OLt zS or OLZS in the German Navy , Oblt.z.S . in the Kriegsmarine ) is traditionally the highest rank of Lieutenant in the German Navy . It is grouped as OF-1a in NATO , equivalent to a Lieutenant Junior Grade in the United States Navy , and a Sub-Lieutenant in the British Royal Navy The rank was introduced in the Imperial German Navy by renaming the former rank of Premier Lieutenant in 1890 . Within the navy officers of this rank were simply addressed as Herr Oberleutnant . To distinguish naval officers from those of the army , the suffix zur See ( at sea ) was added in official communications , sometimes shortened to z.S . ( Oblt.z.S. ) . The rank has since been used by the Reichsmarine , Kriegsmarine , and Bundesmarine . In the Volksmarine the rank was originally used in the same way until the suffix zur See was dropped .

  "/wiki/Killed_in_action": "Killed in action ( KIA ) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their own combatants at the hands of hostile forces . The United States Department of Defense , for example , says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack . KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat , but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes , murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism . KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval , air and support troops . Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a \u2020 ( dagger ) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events . [ citation needed ] Further , KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas died of wounds ( DOW ) relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) also uses DWRIA , rather than DOW , for died of wounds received in action . However , historically , militaries and historians have used the former acronym . [ citation needed ] PKIA means presumed killed in action . This term is used when personnel are lost in battle , initially listed missing in action ( MIA ) , but after not being found , are later presumed to have not survived .",

  "/wiki/Military_reserve_force": "A military reserve force is a military organization composed of citizen-soldiers of a country who combine a military role or career with a civilian career . They are not normally kept under arms and their main role is to be available to fight when their military requires additional manpower . Reserve forces are generally considered part of a permanent standing body of armed forces . The existence of reserve forces allows a nation to reduce its peacetime military expenditures while maintaining a force prepared for war . It is analogous to the historical model of military recruitment before the era of standing armies . In some countries , such as Canada , United States , Spain and the United Kingdom , members of the reserve forces are civilians who maintain military skills by training , typically one weekend a month . They may do so as individuals or as members of standing reserve regiments , for example the Army Reserve of the United Kingdom . In some cases a militia , home guard , state guard , or State Military could constitute part of a military reserve forces , such as the United States National Guard , the Norwegian Home Guard , the Swedish Home Guard , or the Danish Home Guard . In Colombia , Israel , Norway , Singapore , South Korea , Sweden and Taiwan service in the reserves is compulsory for a number of years after one has completed national service . A military reserve force is different from a reserve formation , sometimes called a military reserve , a group of military personnel or units not committed to a battle by their commander so that they are available to address unforeseen situations , bolster defences , or exploit opportunities .",
