The film was directed by creator John A. Davis and written by Davis and producer Steve Oedekerk , with voice talents by Debi Derryberry , Patrick Stewart , Martin Short , Rob Paulsen , and Jeffrey Garcia . The precursor to the TV show , The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius , which followed shortly after , Jimmy Neutron follows the title character , a schoolboy with super-genius powers who must save all of the parents of the world from a race of egg-like aliens known as the Yolkians . The idea for Jimmy Neutron was first created by Davis in the 1980s , in which he wrote a script for a short film titled Runaway Rocketboy and starring a prototype character for Jimmy named Johnny Quasar . After coming across the abandoned script several years later , Davis decided that it would be a good idea to revisit it and retool it as a computer animated short and potential TV series . A 40-second demo was animated using LightWave 3D and gained popularity at the 1995 SIGGRAPH convention where it was shown off , grabbing the attention of Oedekerk and leading DNA Productions to develop an extended TV Pilot . After a successful pitch to Nickelodeon , a 13-minute-long TV episode was developed , and Nickelodeon , impressed with both the character and the 3D technology , raised the possibility making both a TV series and a full-length feature film . Davis , in turn , suggested that the film be made first , so that the development team could create the assets at theatrical quality and reuse them in the TV series . Production officially began in early 2000 , and was completed in roughly 24 months , with DNA Productions considerably raising its staff count and expanding its studio space . Animation was done entirely using commercial software , including Lightwave and project : messiah . Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius was released on December 21 , 2001 . Backed by a strong pre-release campaign , the film was a box office success , grossing $ 103 million worldwide",

As introduced in Buffy in 1997 , Angel is a love interest for heroine Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , a young woman whose destiny as the Slayer is to fight the forces of evil , such as vampires and demons . However , their relationship is complicated by the fact that Angel is himself a vampire cursed with remorse and a human soul , which motivates him to assist Buffy in her duties as Slayer .
