  "/wiki/Survival_horror": "Survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience . Although combat can be part of the gameplay , the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition , health , speed and vision , or through various obstructions of the player 's interaction with the game mechanics . The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game . Games make use of strong horror themes , like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies . The term survival horror was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996 , which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 's Sweet Home and 1992 's Alone in the Dark . The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay , and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles . Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005 , the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games . This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as action horror .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

  "/wiki/Adventure_game": "In video game culture , an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving . The genre 's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media , literature and film , encompassing a wide variety of literary genres . Many adventure games ( text and graphic ) are designed for a single player , since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult . Colossal Cave Adventure is identified [ by whom ? ] as the first such adventure game , first released in 1976 , while other notable adventure game series include Zork , King 's Quest , The Secret of Monkey Island , and Myst . Initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based , using text parsers to translate the player 's input into commands . As personal computers became more powerful with better graphics , the graphic adventure-game format became popular , initially by augmenting player 's text commands with graphics , but soon moving towards point-and-click interfaces . Further computer advances led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or full-motion video taken from the first- or third-person perspective . For markets in the Western hemisphere , the genre 's popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid-1990s when many [ quantify ] considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres , but it had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of first-person shooters , and it became difficult for developers to find publishers to support adventure-game ventures . Since then , a resurgence in the genre has occurred , spurred on by the success of independent video-game development , particularly from crowdfunding efforts , from the wide availability of digital distribution enabling episodic approaches , and from the proliferation of new gaming platforms , including portable consoles and mobile devices . The Walking Dead is considered [ by whom ? ] to be a key title which rejuvenated the genre .",

  "/wiki/Platform_game": "Platform games , or platformers , are a video game genre and subgenre of action game . In a platformer , the player controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles . Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed . The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps . The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button , but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen . Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well , such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks , as in Ristar or Bionic Commando , or bouncing from springboards or trampolines , as in Alpha Waves . These mechanics , even in the context of other genres , are commonly called platforming , a verbification of platform . Games where jumping is automated completely , such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series , fall outside of the genre . Platform games originated in the early 1980s , which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping , with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s . The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established , no later than 1983 . The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres , such as the shooter elements in Contra , Beat 'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe , adventure elements of Flashback , or role-playing game elements of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . While commonly associated with console gaming , there have been many important platform games released to video arcades , as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers .",

  "/wiki/First-person_shooter": "First-person shooter ( FPS ) is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective ; that is , the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist . The genre shares common traits with other shooter games , which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game . Since the genre 's inception , advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development , and multiplayer gaming has been integral . The first-person shooter genre has been traced as far back as Maze War , development of which began in 1973 , and 1974 's Spasim . Later , and after more playful titles like MIDI Maze in 1987 , the genre coalesced into a more violent form with 1992 's Wolfenstein 3D , which has been credited with creating the genre 's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based . One such title , and the progenitor of the genre 's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity , was Doom , one of the most influential games in this genre ; for some years , the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to Doom 's influence . Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years , since processing limitations of the era 's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed areas , such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels . 1998 's Half-Life - along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2 - enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements . In 1999 , the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and , together with Doom , is perhaps one of the most influential first-person shooters . GoldenEye 007 , released in 1997 , was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles , while the Halo series heightened the console 's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for first-person shooter titles . In the 21st century , the first-person shooter is the most commercially viable video game genre , and in 2016 , shooters accounted for over 27 % of all video game sales . Several first-person shooters have been popular games for esports and competitive gaming competitions as well .",

The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective and its open world is navigated on foot or by riding a prehistoric animal . Players can use firearms and improvised weapons to defend against hostile humans and creatures , with the ability to build bases as defense on the ground and on some creatures . The game has both single-player and multiplayer options . Multiplayer allows the option to form tribes of members in a server . The max number of tribe mates varies from each server . In this mode all tamed dinosaurs and building structures are usually shared between the members . There is a PvE mode where players can not fight each other . Development began in October 2014 , where it was first released on PC as an early access title in the middle of 2015 . The development team conducted research into the physical appearance of the animals , but took creative license for gameplay purposes .",
  "/wiki/Open_world": "In video games , an open world is a virtual world in which the player can explore and approach objectives freely , as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay . While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s , the implementation in Grand Theft Auto III ( 2001 ) set a standard that has been used since . Games with open or free-roaming worlds typically lack level structures like walls and locked doors , or the invisible walls in more open areas that prevent the player from venturing beyond them ; only at the bounds of an open world game will players be limited by geographic features like vast oceans or impassible mountains . Players typically do not encounter loading screens common in linear level designs when moving about the game world , with the open world game using strategic storage and memory techniques to load the game world in a dynamic and seamless manner . Open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment , either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game 's linearity . While the openness of the game world is an important facet to games featuring open worlds , the main draw of open world games is about providing the player with autonomy - not so much the freedom to do anything they want in the game ( which is nearly impossible with current computing technology ) , but the ability to choose how to approach the game and its challenges in the order and manner as the player desires while still constrained by gameplay rules . Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPG ) or in single-player games adhering to the open-world concept such as the Fallout series . The main appeal of open-world gameplay is that they provide a simulated reality and allow players to develop their character and its behaviour in the direction and the pace of their own choosing . In these cases , there is often no concrete goal or end to the game , although there may be the main storyline , such as with games like The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim .",
  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",

  "/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game": "Massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs ) are a combination of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world . As in all role-playing games or RPGs , the player assumes the role of a character ( often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world ) and takes control over many of that character 's actions . MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together , and by the game 's persistent world ( usually hosted by the game 's publisher ) , which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game . MMORPGs are played throughout the world . Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005 , and Western revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006 . In 2008 , the spending on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew to $ 1.4 billion . World of Warcraft , a popular MMORPG , has over 10 million subscribers as of November 2014 . World of Warcraft 's total revenue was $ 1.04 billion US dollars in 2014 . Star Wars : The Old Republic , released in 2011 , became the world 's 'Fastest-Growing MMO Ever ' after gaining more than 1 million subscribers within the first three days of its launch .",

  "/wiki/Racing_simulation": "Sim ( simulated ) racing is the collective term for computer software that attempts to accurately simulate auto racing , complete with real-world variables such as fuel usage , damage , tire wear and grip , and suspension settings . To be competitive in sim racing , a driver must understand all aspects of car handling that make real-world racing so difficult , such as threshold braking , how to maintain control of a car as the tires lose traction , and how properly to enter and exit a turn without sacrificing speed . It is this level of difficulty that distinguishes sim racing from arcade driving games where real-world variables are taken out of the equation and the principal objective is to create a sense of speed as opposed to a sense of realism . In general , sim racing applications , such as rFactor , Grand Prix Legends , NASCAR Racing , Race 07 , F1 Challenge '99-'02 , Assetto Corsa , GTR 2 , Project CARS , iRacing and Richard Burns Rally are less popular than arcade-style games , mainly because much more skill and practice is required to master them . An exception is Gran Turismo , which has achieved worldwide fame , as have simcade titles such as Forza Motorsport , Colin McRae Rally , F1 '09-'19 and NASCAR Heat Evolution . Also , because of the demands on the computer system , race sims require faster computers to run effectively , as well as a somewhat costly steering wheel and pedals for the throttle and brakes . Most arcade-style driving games can be played with a simple joystick controller or even a mouse and keyboard . With the development of online racing capability , the ability to drive against human opponents as opposed to computer AI is the closest many will come to driving real cars on a real track . Even those who race in real-world competition use simulations for practice or for entertainment . With continued development of the physics engine software that forms the basis of these sims , as well as improved hardware ( providing tactile feedback ) , the experience is becoming more realistic .",
