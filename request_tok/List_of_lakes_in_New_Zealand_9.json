  "/wiki/Lake_Wairarapa": "Lake Wairarapa is a lake at the southern end of the North Island of New Zealand , 50 kilometers east of Wellington . The lake covers an area of 78 km2 ( 30 sq mi ) , and at its deepest is 2.5 m ( 8.2 ft ) . The lake is the third largest in the North Island , fractionally smaller than Lake Rotorua . The nearest town to the lake is Featherston , which is located five kilometres from its northern shore.The lake forms part of the Wairarapa Moana Wetlands Park . The lake 's catchment area is large , and includes the eastern slopes of the Remutaka and Tararua Ranges . The lake takes water from several rivers and was originally the main outflow for the Ruamahanga . This in turn drained slowly into Palliser Bay and Cook Strait ten kilometres south near the settlement of Lake Ferry , via what is now Lake Onoke . The river , however , was diverted in the 1960s to assist flow , thereby reducing flooding for farmers . The lake today therefore covers an area significantly smaller than its historical size of around 210 km\u00b2 . The area around the lake is low-lying and swampy , and recent efforts have been made to preserve its important wetland features and restore wildlife habitat that has been degraded through human use . Agriculture and river development , flood control , and waterway diversions have resulted in the drainage of large areas of the wetlands , reducing their ecological values . Lake Wairarapa is classed as supertrophic on the trophic level index , meaning that it is highly polluted with nitrates which leach from intensified agriculture surrounding the lake .",

  "/wiki/Oxbow_lake": "An oxbow lake is a U-shaped lake that forms when a wide meander of a river is cut off , creating a free-standing body of water . This landform is so named for its distinctive curved shape , which resembles the bow pin of an oxbow . In Australia , an oxbow lake is called a billabong , from the indigenous Wiradjuri language . In south Texas , oxbows left by the Rio Grande are called resacas . The word oxbow can also refer to a U-shaped bend in a river or stream , whether or not it is cut off from the main stream .",
  "/wiki/Ruamahanga_River": "The Ruamahanga River runs through the southeastern North Island of New Zealand . The river 's headwaters are in the Tararua Ranges northwest of Masterton . From there it runs firstly south and then southwest for 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) before emptying into the Cook Strait . The towns of Masterton and Martinborough are close to the banks of the river . It is joined by many other rivers , including the Tauweru River near Gladstone . In its lower reaches , the river meanders across a large floodplain , culminating in the wetlands around the edges of Lake Wairarapa . The river once flowed into the lake , but has now been diverted . The river drains at Palliser Bay 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) further south . The river has now become generally polluted from sewage and farming that prevents people from swimming in the river or its tributaries .

  "/wiki/Lake_Kohangapiripiri": "Lake Kohangapiripiri is one of the two freshwater Pencarrow lakes in Fitzroy Bay - the other being the slightly larger Lake Kohangatera . It stands to the east of Pencarrow Head , on the eastern side of New Zealand 's Wellington Harbour , in East Harbour Regional Park , and is fed by Cameron Stream which rises on private land to its north .

The total area administered by the Council is 377 km2 ( 146 sq mi ) around the lower half of the Hutt Valley and along the eastern shores of Wellington Harbour , of which 135 km2 ( 52 sq mi ) is urban . It is separated from the city of Wellington by the harbour , and from Upper Hutt by the Taita Gorge . Though the Hutt City Council administers the city , neither the New Zealand Geographic Board nor the Local Government Act recognises the name Hutt City . This name has led to confusion , as Upper Hutt is administered by a separate city council , the Upper Hutt City Council , which objects to the name Hutt City . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Pencarrow_Head": "Pencarrow Head , also known as Pencarrow , is a headland in the Wellington Region of New Zealand and the name of the surrounding area .

The head marks the northern end of Fitzroy Bay . The main attraction of Pencarrow Head is the Pencarrow Head Lighthouse , the first permanent lighthouse in New Zealand constructed in 1859 . It is one of Wellington 's most notable heritage locations and New Zealand 's only female lighthouse keeper , Mary Bennett , worked here . The return walk from Eastbourne takes four hours . The Pencarrow lakes , Lake Kohangapiripiri and Lake Kohangatera , are freshwater wetlands that were blocked from the sea by earthquake activity .

  "/wiki/Kapiti_Island": "Kapiti Island is an island about 5 km ( 3 mi ) off the west coast of the lower North Island of New Zealand . It is 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) long , running southwest/northeast , and roughly 2 kilometres ( 1.2 mi ) wide , being more or less rectangular in shape , and has an area of 19.65 km2 ( 7.59 sq mi ) . The island is separated from the North Island by the Rauoterangi channel . The highest point on the island is Tuteremoana , 521 m ( 1,709 ft ) . The seaward ( west ) side of the island is particularly rocky and has high cliffs , some hundreds of metres high , that drop straight into the sea . The cliffs are subject to very strong prevailing westerly winds and the scrubby vegetation that grows there is low and stunted by the harsh environmental conditions . A cross-section of the island would show almost a right-angled triangle , revealing its origins from lying on a fault line ( part of the same ridge as the Tararua Range ) . The island 's vegetation is dominated by scrub and forest of kohekohe , tawa , and kanuka . Most of the forest is regenerating after years of burn-offs and farming , but some areas of original bush with 30 m ( 98 ft ) trees remain . Its name has been used since 1989 by the Kapiti Coast District Council , which includes towns such as Paekakariki , Raumati , Paraparaumu and Waikanae .",

  "/wiki/Waikanae_River": "Waikanae River is located on the Kapiti Coast in the North Island of New Zealand . The river drains the western flanks of the Tararua Ranges around Reikorangi and the Akatarawa Valley , then passes to the south of the town of Waikanae before entering the Tasman Sea at Waikanae Beach . Tributaries include the Maungakotukutuku Stream , Ngatiawa River , and Reikorangi Stream . The estuary of the river is a significant reserve providing shelter and habitat for local and migratory seabirds . It also provides a major recreational location , both for residents and tourists . Water up to a maximum amount is taken out of the river as water supply for Waikanae and Paraparaumu . This sometimes leads to water restrictions if the river runs low , however in January 2005 the river burst its banks after heavy rain . The river has good water quality and high aquatic biodiversity , but there are occasional blooms of toxic cyanobacteria after prolonged periods of low flow during hot , dry weather ."
