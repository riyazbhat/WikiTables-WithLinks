  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_France": "The Kingdom of France ( French : Royaume de France ) was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Western Europe . It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years ' War . It was also an early colonial power , with possessions around the world . France originated as West Francia ( Francia Occidentalis ) , the western half of the Carolingian Empire , with the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) . A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987 , when Hugh Capet was elected king and founded the Capetian dynasty . The territory remained known as Francia and its ruler as rex Francorum ( king of the Franks ) well into the High Middle Ages . The first king calling himself Roi de France ( King of France ) was Philip II , in 1190 . France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines - the Valois and Bourbon - until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the French Revolution . France in the Middle Ages was a de-centralised , feudal monarchy . In Brittany and Catalonia ( now a part of Spain ) the authority of the French king was barely felt . Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not yet a part of France . Initially , West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates , but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father 's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture , which became codified in the Salic law .",
  "/wiki/Siege_artillery_in_the_American_Civil_War": "Siege artillery is heavy artillery primarily used in military attacks on fortified positions . At the time of the American Civil War , the U.S. Army classified its artillery into three hundred varied types , depending on the gun 's weight and intended use . Field artillery were light pieces that often traveled with the armies . Siege and garrison artillery were heavy pieces that could be used either in attacking or defending fortified places . Seacoast artillery were the heaviest pieces and were intended to be used in permanent fortifications along the seaboard . They were primarily designed to fire on attacking warships ( Gibbon 1863 , p. 54 ) . The distinctions are somewhat arbitrary , as field , siege and garrison , and seacoast artillery were all used in various attacks and defenses of fortifications . This article will focus on the use of heavy artillery in the attack of fortified places during the American Civil War . The weight and size of siege artillery prevented it from regularly travelling with the armies . When needed , siege artillery and other material needed for siege operations were assembled into what was called a siege train and transported to the army . In the American Civil War , the siege train was always transported to the area of the siege by water . The siege trains of the Civil War consisted almost exclusively of guns and mortars .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions .

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Dutch_Republic": "The United Provinces of the Netherlands , or simply United Provinces ( officially the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ) , and commonly referred to historiographically as the Dutch Republic , was a federal republic formally established from the formal creation of a federal state in 1581 by several Dutch provinces - seceded from Spanish rule - until the Batavian Revolution of 1795 . It was a predecessor state of the Netherlands and the first fully independent Dutch nation state . The small republic of around 1.5 million inhabitants distinguished itself by world trade through the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and the Dutch West India Company ( WIC ) , by its great military successes against ostensibly stronger countries such as Spain and England , by its huge fleet ( with 2,000 ships , larger than that of England and France combined ) , by the flourishing of arts ( painters such as Rembrandt , Johannes Vermeer and many others ) and sciences ( including Hugo Grotius and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ) , and by its relatively tolerant atmosphere towards different religions and ideas ( freedom of thought ) . Because Dutch trade , science , military , and art were among the most acclaimed in the world during much of the 17th century , this period became known in Dutch history as the Dutch Golden Age .",

It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ( modern-day Bilecik Province ) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I . Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin , it was Persianised in terms of language , culture , literature and habits . After 1354 , the Ottomans crossed into Europe , and with the conquest of the Balkans , the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire . The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror . During the 16th and 17th centuries , at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire was a multinational , multilingual empire controlling most of Southeast Europe , parts of Central Europe , Western Asia , parts of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , North Africa and the Horn of Africa . At the beginning of the 17th century , the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states . Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire , while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries . [ note 7 ] With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin , the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries . While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent , this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians . The empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy , society and military throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century . However , during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 , the Ottoman military system fell behind that of their European rivals , the Habsburg and Russian empires .",

  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire": "The Holy Roman Empire ( Latin : Sacrum Imperium Romanum ; German : Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich ) , also known as Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars . The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany , though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy , plus numerous other territories , and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added . Its size gradually diminished over time , particularly from 1648 onward , and by the time of its dissolution , it largely contained only German-speaking territories ( although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included ) , plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides . At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation . On 25 December 800 , Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor , reviving the title in Western Europe , more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476 . The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899 , after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant , Berengar I , in 924 . The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor , fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries . Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire , while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning . Scholars generally concur , however , in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire , describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role . The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century , but the concept of translatio imperii , [ d ] the notion that he - the sovereign ruler - held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome , was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor . The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective , although frequently controlled by dynasties . The mostly German prince-electors , the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire , usually elected one of their peers as King of the Romans , and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope ; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century .",
  "/wiki/Faule_Mette": "The Faule Mette ( German for Lazy Mette , alluding to the gun 's rare deployment , difficult mobility , and limited loading and fire rate ) or Faule Metze was a medieval large-calibre cannon of the city of Brunswick , Germany .
