  "/wiki/Kurt_Welter": "Kurt Welter ( 25 February 1916 - 7 March 1949 ) was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace and the most successful Jet Expert of World War II . [ Note 1 ] A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat . He claimed a total of 63 aerial victories - that is , 63 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft - achieved in 93 combat missions . He recorded 56 victories at night , including 33 Mosquitos , and scored more aerial victories from a jet fighter aircraft than anyone else in World War II and possibly in aviation history . However this score is a matter of controversy ; research of Royal Air Force losses suggests Welter overclaimed Mosquito victories considerably . Welter was born in Cologne-Lindenthal on 25 February 1916 . He joined the military service of the Luftwaffe in 1934 and was trained as a pilot . He showed a strong natural ability as a pilot and was subsequently selected for flight instructor training and served many years as a flight instructor . In 1943 Welter transferred to an operational night fighter unit flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft . On 18 October 1944 , after 40 combat missions , Welter was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . In early 1945 , Welter transferred to an experimental jet night fighter unit flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 . On 11 March 1945 he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves for 48 aerial victories .",

B\u00e4r flew more than one thousand combat missions , and fought in the Western , Eastern and Mediterranean theatres . On 18 occasions he survived being shot down , and according to records in the German Federal Archives , he claimed to have shot down 228 enemy aircraft and was credited with 208 aerial victories , 16 of which were in a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . B\u00e4r , a native of Saxony , joined the Reichswehr in 1934 and transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1935 . Serving first as a mechanic , then as a pilot on transport aircraft , he was informally trained as a fighter pilot . He claimed his first aerial victory in September 1939 on the French border . By the end of the Battle of Britain , his tally of victories had increased to 17 . Transferred to the Eastern Front to participate in Operation Barbarossa , he quickly accumulated further victories , a feat that earned him the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for 90 aerial victories in February 1942 . During the remainder of World War II , B\u00e4r was credited with 130 other aerial victories , including 16 while flying one of the first jet fighters , the Me 262 , an achievement which would normally have earned him the coveted Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds .

  "/wiki/Hauptmann": "Hauptmann is a German word usually translated as captain when it is used as an officer 's rank in the German , Austrian , and Swiss armies . While Haupt in contemporary German means 'main ' , it also has and originally had the meaning of 'head ' , i.e . Hauptmann literally translates to 'head-man ' , which is also the etymological root of captain ( from Latin caput , 'head ' ) . It equates to the rank of captain in the British and US Armies , and is rated OF-2 in NATO . ( For the German maritime counterpart to captain , see Kapit\u00e4n . ) More generally , it can be used to denote the head of any hierarchically structured group of people , often as a compound word . For example , a Feuerwehrhauptmann is the captain of a fire brigade , while R\u00e4uberhauptmann refers to the leader of a gang of robbers . Official Austrian and German titles incorporating the word include Landeshauptmann , Bezirkshauptmann , Burghauptmann , and Berghauptmann . In Saxony during the Weimar Republic , the titles of Kreishauptmann , and Amtshauptmann were held by senior civil servants . Hauptmann ( from Early Modern High German Heubtmann ) is cognate with the Swedish h\u00f6vitsman , which also has the root meaning 'head-man ' or 'the man at the head ' , and is closely related to h\u00f6vding , meaning 'chieftain ' . Since medieval times , both titles have been used for state administrators rather than military personnel .

  "/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s . In addition to its role as a bomber , the B-17 was also employed as a transport , antisubmarine aircraft , drone controller , and search-and-rescue aircraft .",

Design work started before World War II began , but problems with engines , metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944 . The Me 262 was faster and more heavily armed than any Allied fighter , including the British jet-powered Gloster Meteor . One of the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War II , the Me 262 's roles included light bomber , reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions . Me 262 pilots claimed a total of 542 Allied aircraft shot down , although higher claims are sometimes made . [ Note 1 ] The Allies countered its effectiveness in the air by attacking the aircraft on the ground and during takeoff and landing . Strategic materials shortages and design compromises on the Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet engines led to reliability problems . Attacks by Allied forces on fuel supplies during the deteriorating late-war situation also reduced the effectiveness of the aircraft as a fighting force . Armament production within Germany was focused on more easily manufactured aircraft . In the end , the Me 262 had a negligible impact on the course of the war as a result of its late introduction and the consequently small numbers put in operational service . While German use of the aircraft ended with the close of World War II , a small number were operated by the Czechoslovak Air Force until 1951 .

  "/wiki/Washington,_DC": "Washington , D.C. , ( /\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0\u0283\u026a\u014bt\u0259n \u02ccdi\u02d0\u02c8si\u02d0/ ) formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as D.C. , Washington , or The District , is the capital of the United States . Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country , Washington was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States and a Founding Father . As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast . The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress , and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state . The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States . Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city 's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek . Washington 's metropolitan area , the country 's sixth largest ( including parts of Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) , had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents .",

In 1937 , during the Spanish Civil War , he volunteered for the Condor Legion and flew ground attack missions in support of the Nationalists under Francisco Franco . After finishing his tour in 1938 Galland was employed in the Air Ministry writing doctrinal and technical manuals about his experiences as a ground-attack pilot . During this period Galland served as an instructor for ground-attack units . During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 , he again flew ground attack missions .

  "/wiki/JV_44": "Jagdverband 44 ( JV 44 ) was a German air unit during World War II . It was formed during the last months of World War II to operate the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . The commander of JV 44 was General Adolf Galland , the former General der Jagdflieger ( General of Fighter pilots ) who had recently been sacked from his staff post by Hermann G\u00f6ring for criticizing the operational policies , strategic doctrine , and tactics mandated by the Luftwaffe High Command . Galland was charged with setting up a small Me 262 unit to demonstrate the capabilities of the jet fighter . [ citation needed ] JV 44 comprised a core of experienced pilots ( Experten ) chosen from Galland 's former staff or recruited from units which had been disbanded or were being re-equipped . JV 44 performed well during its brief history , achieving a 4-to-1 kill ratio . However , it had relatively few operational jet planes available for any single sortie and was repeatedly forced to relocate due to the approach of Allied ground forces . Its complement included 50 pilots and 25 airplanes .",
