  "/wiki/Office_Space": "Office Space is a 1999 American comedy film written and directed by Mike Judge . It satirizes the everyday work life of a typical mid-to-late-1990s software company , focusing on a handful of individuals fed up with their jobs . It stars Ron Livingston , Jennifer Aniston , Gary Cole , Stephen Root , David Herman , Ajay Naidu , and Diedrich Bader . Office Space was shot in Dallas and Austin , Texas . It is based on Judge 's Milton cartoon series and was his first foray into live-action filmmaking and his second full-length motion picture release , following Beavis and Butt-Head Do America . His 2009 film Extract is also set in an office and was meant to be a companion piece to Office Space . The film 's sympathetic depiction of ordinary information technology workers garnered a cult following within that field , but it also addresses themes familiar to white-collar employees and the workforce in general . It was a box office disappointment , making $ 12.2 million against a $ 10 million production budget . But after repeated airings on Comedy Central , it sold well on home video , and has become a cult film . Several aspects of the film have become Internet memes . A scene where the three main characters systematically destroy a dysfunctional printer after being laid off has been widely parodied , by Family Guy , Ted Cruz 's presidential campaign , and many amateurs . Swingline introduced a red stapler to its product line after the Milton character used one painted that color in the film .",

  "/wiki/Cool_Hand_Luke": "Cool Hand Luke is a 1967 American prison drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg , starring Paul Newman and featuring George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning performance . Newman stars in the title role as Luke , a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system . The film , set in the early 1950s , is based on Donn Pearce 's 1965 novel of the same name . Pearce sold the story to Warner Bros. , who then hired him to write the script . Due to Pearce 's lack of film experience , the studio added Frank Pierson to rework the screenplay . Newman 's biographer Marie Edelman Borden states that the tough , honest script drew together threads from earlier movies , especially Hombre , Newman 's earlier film of 1967 . The film has been cited by Roger Ebert as an anti-establishment film which was shot during the time of emerging popular opposition to the Vietnam War . Newman 's character , Lucas Jackson , is described ( by the notorious Captain upon his arrival at the prison ) , as a free spirit , whose personal record ( read out loud because of its unusual details ) indicates a man who started well in the U.S. Army - receiving medals for bravery in the war - rose to the rank of sergeant , yet was discharged as a buck private . Luke does not question his physical incarceration , and initially has no thought of escape . But his spirit is not , like that of his fellow inmates , imprisoned . This free thinking is , from the outset , noticed by the institution , its functionaries ( the guards ) , and especially its leaders . Their response is a mixture of both fear and loathing ."
