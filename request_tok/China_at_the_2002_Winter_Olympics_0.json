Yang competed as a short track speed skater for the Chinese national team at the 1994 Winter Olympics , the 1998 Winter Olympics , and the 2002 Winter Olympics . Born 1977 , Yang is sometimes known as Yang Yang ( S ) , to differentiate her from the speed skater named Yang Yang born in 1976 ( known as Yang Yang ( A ) ) . By coincidence , Yang had a one-year and one month older contemporary on the Chinese short track team also named Yang Yang in English and pinyin , although with a different given name in Chinese characters . They were originally referred to as Yang Yang ( L ) ( \u5927\u6768\u626c ) and Yang Yang ( S ) ( \u5c0f\u6768\u9633 ) , for Large and Small ; Yang Yang ( L ) disliked the L designation and changed her designation to Yang Yang ( A ) . A and S also refer to their respective months of birth : August and September respectively .",
  "/wiki/Wang_Chunlu": "Wang Chunlu ( born 27 September 1978 in Changchun , China ) is a Chinese short track speed skater . She won medals in the 500 m and 3000 m relay at the 2002 Winter Olympics . She had also already won a relay silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics , at the age of 19 . Her strongest event by far was always the 500 metres , where she won 3 world titles- 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 . In addition to her Olympic bronze in 2002 , she was also leading the final and on her way to a likely gold medal in 1998 before a dangerous and poorly executed passing attempt by Isabelle Charest unfortunately led to Charest and Wang both falling . Distraught Wang , despite not being injured , refused to complete her 5 laps , and ceded the bronze medal to Chun Lee Kyung , the winner of the B final . Her strong start and strength on high speed corners are what made the 500 metres Wang 's strongest event . Surprisingly her best major meet performance was at the 1995 World Championships at only 16 , where as a relative newcomer she won gold in the 500 meters and 1000 metres , and a bronze in the 1500 metres . Despite this she was narrowly defeated for the Overall points title by Chun Lee Kyung , taking silver overall . She also won silver overall at the 2001 World Championships , and a bronze overall at the 1998 World Championships . She competed in what is perhaps still to this day the strongest era ever in Chinese short track speed skating from 94-2002 due to its depth of established stars such as Wang , both Yang Yang 's ( the one born in 1976 and the one born in 1977 ) , Zhang Yanmei , and Li Yan .",
