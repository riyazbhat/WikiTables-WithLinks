Bedford-Stuyvesant is bordered by Flushing Avenue to the north ( bordering Williamsburg ) , Classon Avenue to the west ( bordering Clinton Hill ) , Broadway to the east ( bordering Bushwick and East New York ) , and Atlantic Avenue to the south ( bordering Crown Heights and Brownsville ) . The main shopping street , Fulton Street runs east-west the length of the neighborhood and intersects high-traffic north-south streets including Bedford Avenue , Nostrand Avenue , and Stuyvesant Avenue . Bedford-Stuyvesant contains four smaller neighborhoods : Bedford , Stuyvesant Heights , Ocean Hill , and Weeksville ( also part of Crown Heights ) . Part of Clinton Hill was once considered part of Bedford-Stuyvesant . Bedford-Stuyvesant has the largest collection of intact and largely untouched Victorian architecture in the country , with roughly 8,800 buildings built before 1900 . Its building stock includes many historic brownstones . These homes were developed for the expanding middle- to upper-middle class from the 1890s to the late 1910s . These homes contain highly ornamental detailing throughout their interiors and have classical architectural elements , such as brackets , quoins , fluting , finials , and elaborate frieze and cornice banding . Since the late 1930s the neighborhood has been a major cultural center for Brooklyn 's African American population . Following the construction of the Fulton Street subway line ( A and \u200bC trains ) in 1936 , African Americans left an overcrowded Harlem for greater housing availability in Bedford-Stuyvesant . From Bedford-Stuyvesant , African Americans have since moved into the surrounding areas of Brooklyn , such as East New York , Crown Heights , Brownsville , and Fort Greene .",

It is New York City 's most populous borough , with an estimated 2,504,700 residents in 2010 . Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen , it shares a land border with the borough of Queens at the western end of Long Island .

If each borough were ranked as a city , Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S. , after Los Angeles and Chicago . Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city ( and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution ) until January 1 , 1898 , when , after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s , according to the new Municipal Charter of Greater New York , Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities , boroughs , and counties to form the modern City of New York , surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs . The borough continues , however , to maintain a distinct culture . Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves . Brooklyn 's official motto , displayed on the Borough seal and flag , is Eendraght Maeckt Maght , which translates from early modern Dutch as Unity makes strength . In the first decades of the 21st century , Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as an avant-garde destination for hipsters , with concomitant gentrification , dramatic house price increases and a decrease in housing affordability . Since the 2010s , Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship , high technology startup firms , postmodern art and design .",
