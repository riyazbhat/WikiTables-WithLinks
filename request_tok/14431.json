  "/wiki/Pterodactylus": "Pterodactylus ( meaning winged finger ) is an extinct genus of pterosaurs , whose members are commonly known as pterodactyls ( /\u02cct\u025br\u0259\u02c8d\u00e6kt\u026alz/ ) . It is thought to contain only a single species , Pterodactylus antiquus , the first pterosaur species to be named and identified as a flying reptile . The fossil remains of this species have been found primarily in the Solnhofen limestone of Bavaria , Germany , dated to the late Jurassic Period ( early Tithonian ) , about 150.8-148.5 million years ago , though more fragmentary remains have been tentatively identified from elsewhere in Europe and in Africa . It was a carnivore and probably preyed upon fish and other small animals . Like all pterosaurs , Pterodactylus had wings formed by a skin and muscle membrane stretching from its elongated fourth finger to its hind limbs . It was supported internally by collagen fibres and externally by keratinous ridges .",

  "/wiki/Nyctosaurus": "Nyctosaurus is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur , the remains of which have been found in the Niobrara Formation of the mid-western United States , which , during the late Cretaceous Period , was covered in an extensive shallow sea . The genus Nyctosaurus has had numerous species referred to it , though how many of these may actually be valid requires further study . At least one species possessed an extraordinarily large antler-like cranial crest .",
  "/wiki/Ornithocheirus": "Ornithocheirus ( from Ancient Greek \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 , meaning bird , and \u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c1 , meaning hand ) is a pterosaur genus known from fragmentary fossil remains uncovered from sediments in the UK . Several species have been referred to the genus , most of which are now considered as dubious species , or members of different genera , and the genus is now often considered to include only the type species , Ornithocheirus simus . Species have been referred to Ornithocheirus from the mid-Cretaceous period of both Europe and South America , but O. simus is known only from the UK . Because O. simus was originally named based on poorly preserved fossil material , the genus Ornithocheirus has suffered enduring problems of zoological nomenclature . Fossil remains of Ornithocheirus have been recovered mainly from the Cambridge Greensand of England , dating to the beginning of the Albian stage of the early Cretaceous period , about 110 million years ago . Additional fossils from the Santana Formation of Brazil are sometimes classified as species of Ornithocheirus , but have also been placed in their own genera , most notably Tropeognathus .",

  "/wiki/Ornithostoma": "Ornithostoma ( meaning bird mouth ) is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaurs . In 1869 , Harry Govier Seeley , cataloguing the fossils of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge , referred three snout fragments of toothless pterosaur specimens from the Lower Cretaceous Albian Cambridge Greensand of England to Ornithocheirus simus . These fragments had in 1859 been described by Richard Owen and referred to Pterodactylus sedgwickii and Pterodactylus fittoni . By 1871 Seeley had realised Ornithocheirus simus was a toothed form , different from the fragments . Therefore , he provisionally named them as a separate genus Ornithostoma , the name derived from Greek \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 , ornis , bird , and \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 , stoma , mouth . Seeley as yet provided no specific name . In 1891 however , he named the type species Ornithostoma sedgwicki Seeley 1891 , apart from the snout fragments also referring to pelvis elements , claiming it was identical to Pteranodon and had priority . On that occasion he also selected a genolectotype from the three fragments , the holotype of the type species : specimen CAMSM B.54485 . Samuel Wendell Williston in 1893 independently also considered Ornithostoma a synonym of Pteranodon ingens . He therefore renamed Pteranodon species : Ornithostoma ingens ( Marsh 1872 ) Williston 1893 = Pteranodon ingens ( = P. longiceps ) and Ornithostoma harpyia ( Cope 1872 ) = P. longiceps . Williston also created a special family and subfamily for Ornithostoma : the Ornithostomatidae and the Ornithostomatinae . Today , these concepts are no longer used .",

Gilmore named many dinosaurs in North America and Mongolia , including the Cretaceous sauropod Alamosaurus , Alectrosaurus , Archaeornithomimus , Bactrosaurus , Brachyceratops , Chirostenotes , Mongolosaurus , Parrosaurus , Pinacosaurus , Styracosaurus ovatus ( now Rubeosaurus ) and Thescelosaurus .",

  "/wiki/Bennettazhia": "Bennettazhia is a genus of pterosaur ( flying reptile ) . In 1928 Charles Gilmore named a new species of Pteranodon : P. oregonensis . A humerus ( holotype MPUC V.126713 ) , two fused dorsal vertebrae and the broken-off end of some joint bone had been unearthed from the Lower Cretaceous ( Albian ) beds of the Hudspeth Formation in Wheeler County , in the state of Oregon , USA , to which the specific epithet refers . Gilmore noted similarities to Nyctosaurus though the specimens were larger . In 1989 S. Christopher Bennett concluded that the remains might be those of a member of the Azhdarchidae instead of a pteranodontid . Russian paleontologist Lev Nesov therefore in 1991 named a new azhdarchid genus : Bennettazhia . The genus name honours Bennett and combines his name with Persian azhdarha , dragon , a reference to Azhdarcho , the type genus of the Azhdarchidae . Bennett himself in 1994 changed his opinion and stated that it belonged to the Dsungaripteridae . Wellnhofer ( 1991 ) , Peters ( 1997 ) , Kellner ( 2003 ) and Unwin ( 2003 ) left it as belonging to the Pterodactyloidea incertae sedis . In 2007 American biologist Michael Habib revealed the result of a study by CAT-scan of the type specimen . The humerus , 183 millimetres long , is uncrushed , which is uncommon for a pterosaur fossil and therefore offered a rare opportunity to investigate the bone structure . Apart from the thin bone wall , the humerus was filled with a spongy tissue consisting of trabeculae , very thin bone layers and struts , forming a light yet strong construction ."
