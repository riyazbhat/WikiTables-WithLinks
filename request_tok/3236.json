  "/wiki/Michael_Behe": "Michael J. Behe ( /\u02c8bi\u02d0hi\u02d0/ BEE-hee ; born January 18 , 1952 ) is an American biochemist , author , and advocate of the pseudoscientific principle of intelligent design ( ID ) . He serves as professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and as a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute 's Center for Science and Culture . Behe is best known as an advocate for the validity of the argument for irreducible complexity ( IC ) , which claims that some biochemical structures are too complex to be explained by known evolutionary mechanisms and are therefore probably the result of intelligent design . Behe has testified in several court cases related to intelligent design , including the court case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District where his views were cited in the ruling that intelligent design is not science and is religious in nature . Behe 's claims about the irreducible complexity of essential cellular structures have been rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community , and his own biology department at Lehigh University published a statement repudiating Behe 's views and intelligent design .",
  "/wiki/Intelligent_design": "Intelligent design ( ID ) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God , presented by its proponents as an evidence-based scientific theory about life 's origins . Proponents claim that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a Christian , politically conservative think tank based in the United States . [ n 1 ] Though the phrase intelligent design had featured previously in theological discussions of the argument from design , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . [ n 2 ] ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design .",
  "/wiki/Discovery_Institute": "The Discovery Institute ( DI ) is a politically conservative non-profit think tank based in Seattle , Washington , that advocates the pseudoscientific concept of intelligent design ( ID ) . Its Teach the Controversy campaign aims to permit the teaching of anti-evolution , intelligent-design beliefs in United States public high school science courses in place of accepted scientific theories , positing that a scientific controversy exists over these subjects when in fact there is none .",
  "/wiki/Center_for_Science_and_Culture": "The Center for Science and Culture ( CSC ) , formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture ( CRSC ) , is part of the Discovery Institute ( DI ) , a conservative Christian think tank in the United States . The CSC lobbies for the inclusion of creationism in the form of intelligent design ( ID ) in public-school science curricula as an explanation for the origins of life and the universe while trying to cast doubt on the theory of evolution . These positions have been rejected by the scientific community , which identifies intelligent design as pseudoscientific neo-creationism , whereas the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of scientific consensus . The Center for Science and Culture serves as the hub of the intelligent design movement . Nearly all of prominent proponents of intelligent design are either CSC advisors , officers , or fellows . Stephen C. Meyer , a former vice president of the Discovery Institute and founder of the CSC , serves as a Senior Fellow , and Phillip E. Johnson was the Program Advisor . Johnson is commonly presented as the movement 's father and architect of the Center 's Wedge strategy and Teach the Controversy campaign , as well as the Santorum Amendment .",

  "/wiki/Cooper_Union": "The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art , commonly known as Cooper Union or The Cooper Union and informally referred to , especially during the 19th century , as 'the Cooper Institute , ' is a private college at Cooper Square on the border of the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan , New York City . Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported \u00c9cole Polytechnique in France , Cooper Union was established in 1859 . The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on founder Peter Cooper 's fundamental belief that an education equal to the best technology schools [ then ] established should be accessible to those who qualify , independent of their race , religion , sex , wealth or social status , and should be open and free to all . Cooper envisioned his school replacing the declining master/apprentice system with a higher form of education suited to a new age . Machinery has , in a great measure , driven out the old trades , and the discipline of the old apprentice system has passed away . Our youth in the industrial classes begin life under very different auspices . The situation was particularly dire for girls who rarely had the advantage of apprenticeship and were easily exploited by their employers , and for young women of refinement and general culture thrown upon their own resources by the peculiar conditions and characteristics of American life . All I want , Cooper was remembered often saying , is that these poor women shall earn decent and respectable livings , and especially that they shall be kept from marrying bad husbands . True to his ideals , the institute 's night school was open to boys and girls , and in 1858 , a year before the Cooper Union officially opened , the New York School of Design for Women was moved into the building . The Cooper Union originally offered free courses to its admitted students , and when a four-year undergraduate program was established in 1902 , the school granted each admitted student a full-tuition scholarship . Following its own financial crisis , the school decided to abandon this policy starting in the fall of 2014 . Each incoming student receives at least a half-tuition merit scholarship , with additional school financial support , which is provided on a sliding scale up to full tuition scholarships ( for which a significant number of students qualify ) , based on financial needs .",

  "/wiki/Emperor": "An emperor ( from Latin : imperator , via Old French : empereor ) is a monarch , and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm . Empress , the female equivalent , may indicate an emperor 's wife ( empress consort ) , mother ( empress dowager ) , or a woman who rules in her own right ( empress regnant ) . Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings . In Europe , the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages , considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter 's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe . The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as Emperor . Both emperors and kings are monarchs , but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles . Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor , it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation . Therefore a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler , or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion , but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints . However , monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts - the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India , though she was declared Empress of India . In Western Europe , the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor , whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii , i.e . they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors , thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology . Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy , by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states .",
