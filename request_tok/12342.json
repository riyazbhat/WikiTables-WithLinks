  "/wiki/Piano": "The piano is an acoustic , stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 ( the exact year is uncertain ) , in which the strings are struck by felt hammers . It is played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings . The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate soft and loud respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume ( i.e. , loudness ) produced in response to a pianist 's touch or pressure on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack . The name was created as a contrast to harpsichord , a musical instrument that does not allow variation in volume ; compared to the harpsichord , the first fortepianos in the 1700s had a quieter sound and smaller dynamic range . An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , which are strung under great tension on a heavy metal frame . Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( typically padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released by the fingers and thumbs , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . The sustain pedal enables pianists to play musical passages that would otherwise be impossible , such as sounding a 10-note chord in the lower register and then , while this chord is being continued with the sustain pedal , shifting both hands to the treble range to play a melody and arpeggios over the top of this sustained chord .",

  "/wiki/Clarinet": "The clarinet is a family of woodwind instruments . It has a single-reed mouthpiece , a straight , cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore , and a flared bell . A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist ( sometimes spelled clarinettist ) . While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may hold a clue to its name , other factors may have been involved . During the Late Baroque era , composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters , who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high , or as it came to be called , clarion register . Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons , melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the trumpet 's range , where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes as opposed to the gapped scales or arpeggios of the lower register . The trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to the musicians themselves . It is probable that the term clarinet may stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion ' or 'clarino ' and it has been suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly developed mock trumpets . Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau , usually in the key of C. Over time , additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability . In modern times , the most popular clarinet is the B\u266d clarinet . However , the clarinet in A , just a semitone lower , is regularly used in orchestral music . An orchestral clarinetist must own both a clarinet in A and B\u266d since the repertoire is divided fairly evenly between the two .",

  "/wiki/Violin": "The violin , sometimes known as a fiddle , is a wooden string instrument in the violin family . Most violins have a hollow wooden body . It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use . Smaller violin-type instruments exist , including the violino piccolo and the kit violin , but these are virtually unused . The violin typically has four strings , usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3 , D4 , A4 , E5 , and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings , though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers ( pizzicato ) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow ( col legno ) . Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres . They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition , both in ensembles ( from chamber music to orchestras ) and as solo instruments and in many varieties of folk music , including country music , bluegrass music and in jazz . Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion , with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound . Further , the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures , including Indian music and Iranian music . The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it . The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy , with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection . In Europe , it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music , such as the viola .",

It is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound . Since the 18th century , it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family , between the violin ( which is tuned a perfect fifth above ) and the cello ( which is tuned an octave below ) . The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3 , G3 , D4 , and A4 . In the past , the viola varied in size and style , as did its names . The word viola originates from the Italian language . The Italians often used the term : viola da braccio meaning literally : 'of the arm ' . Brazzo was another Italian word for the viola , which the Germans adopted as Bratsche . The French had their own names : cinquiesme was a small viola , haute contre was a large viola , and taile was a tenor . Today , the French use the term alto , a reference to its range . The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony , up until the eighteenth century , taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line . Music for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef .",

  "/wiki/Accordion": "Accordions ( from 19th-century German Akkordeon , from Akkord - musical chord , concord of sounds ) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type , colloquially referred to as a squeezebox . A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist . The concertina and bandone\u00f3n are related ; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family . The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys , causing pallets to open , which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel , called reeds . These vibrate to produce sound inside the body . Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument 's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block . [ notes 1 ] The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand manual , and the accompaniment , consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons , on the left-hand manual . The accordion is widely spread across the world . In some countries ( for example Brazil , Colombia , Dominican Republic , Mexico and Panama ) it is used in popular music ( for example Gaucho , Forr\u00f3 and Sertanejo in Brazil , Vallenato in Colombia , and norte\u00f1o in Mexico ) , whereas in other regions ( such as Europe , North America and other countries in South America ) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and is often used in folk music in Europe , North America and South America . In Europe and North America , some popular music acts also make use of the instrument .

  "/wiki/Harmonica": "The harmonica , also known as a French harp or mouth organ , is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres , notably in blues , American folk music , classical music , jazz , country , rock . There are many types of harmonica , including diatonic , chromatic , tremolo , octave , orchestral , and bass versions . A harmonica is played by using the mouth ( lips and tongue ) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece . Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed . A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass , stainless steel , or bronze , which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway . When the free end is made to vibrate by the player 's air , it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound . Reeds are pre-tuned to individual pitches . Tuning may involve changing a reeds length , the weight near its free end , or the stiffness near its fixed end . Longer , heavier and springier reeds produce deeper , lower sounds ; shorter , lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds . If , as on most modern harmonicas , a reed is affixed above or below its slot rather than in the plane of the slot , it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot , i.e. , as a closing reed . This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a blow reed and a draw reed in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather ( valves , wind-savers ) to block the non-playing reed . An important technique in performance is bending : causing a drop in pitch by making embouchure adjustments .",

  "/wiki/Trombone": "The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family . As on all brass instruments , sound is produced when the player 's vibrating lips ( embouchure ) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate . Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch . Many modern trombone models also use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument . Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet . The word trombone derives from Italian tromba ( trumpet ) and -one ( a suffix meaning large ) , so the name means large trumpet . The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart , the baritone , in contrast to its conical valved counterparts : the cornet , the euphonium , and the French horn . The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone . The most common variant , the tenor , is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d , an octave below the B\u266d trumpet and an octave above the pedal B\u266d tuba . The once common E\u266d alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor , but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works . Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef , although exceptions do occur , notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B\u266d transposing instrument , written in treble clef . A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player .",

Trumpets are used in art music styles , for instance in orchestras , concert bands , and jazz ensembles , as well as in popular music . They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips ( called the player 's embouchure ) , producing a buzzing sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument . Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing , usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape . There are many distinct types of trumpet , with the most common being pitched in B\u266d ( a transposing instrument ) , having a tubing length of about 1.48 m ( 4 ft 10 in ) . Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing , whereas modern instruments generally have three ( or sometimes four ) valves in order to change their pitch . There are eight combinations of three valves , making seven different tubing lengths , with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1-2 combination . Most trumpets have valves of the piston type , while some have the rotary type . The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings ( especially in German and German-style orchestras ) , although this practice varies by country .",

  "/wiki/Saxophone": "The saxophone ( referred to colloquially as the sax ) is a woodwind instrument usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece . Although most saxophones are made from brass , they are categorized as woodwind instruments , because sound is produced by an oscillating reed , traditionally made out of woody cane , rather than lips vibrating in a mouthpiece cup as with the brass instrument family . As with the other woodwind instruments , the pitch of the note being played is controlled by covering holes in the body tube to control the resonant frequency of the air column by changing the effective length of the tube . The player covers holes by pressing mechanical keys , triggering a system of pads , pivots , and linkages . The saxophone is used in classical music ( such as concert bands , chamber music , solo repertoire , and , occasionally , orchestras ) , military bands , marching bands , jazz ( such as big bands and jazz combos ) , and contemporary music . The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music . Saxophone players are called saxophonists . Since the first saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s , saxophones have been produced in a variety of series distinguished by transpositions within instrument sets and tuning standard . Sax patented the saxophone on 28 June 1846 , in two groups of seven instruments each . Each series consisted of instruments ranked by pitch , in alternating transposition . The series pitched in B\u266d and E\u266d soon became dominant and most saxophones encountered today are from this series . Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only a small percentage of instruments made by Sax .",

  "/wiki/Oboe": "The oboe ( /\u02c8o\u028abo\u028a/ OH-boh ) is a type of double reed woodwind instrument . Oboes are usually made of wood , but may also be made of synthetic materials , such as plastic , resin or hybrid composites . The most common oboe plays in the treble or soprano range . A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm ( 25 1\u20442 in ) long , with metal keys , a conical bore and a flared bell . Sound is produced by blowing into the reed at a sufficient air pressure , causing it to vibrate with the air column . The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as bright . When the word oboe is used alone , it is generally taken to mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family , such as the bass oboe , the cor anglais ( English horn ) , or oboe d'amore . A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist . Today , the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in symphony orchestras , concert bands and chamber ensembles . The oboe is especially used in classical music , chamber music , film music , some genres of folk music , and is occasionally heard in jazz , rock , pop , and popular music .
