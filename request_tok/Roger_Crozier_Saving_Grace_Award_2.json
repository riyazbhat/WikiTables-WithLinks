  "/wiki/Save_percentage": "Save percentage ( often known by such symbols as SV% , SVS% , SVP , PCT ) is a statistic in many sports that track saves as a statistic . In ice hockey and lacrosse , its a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops . It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal . Although the statistic is called save percentage , it is given as a decimal ( in the same way as an on-base percentage in baseball ) . Thus , .933 means a goaltender saved 93.3 percent of all shots they faced . National Hockey League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .900 , and National Lacrosse League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .750 . In ice hockey internationally , a save percentage is expressed as a true percentage ( e.g . 90% ) , not a decimal . Save percentage applies in an analogous way to goalkeepers in association football . Save percentage in baseball applies to relief pitchers , particularly closers . This is the quotient of the number of successful saves and the number of save opportunities .",
