Instruments include graphite pencils , pen and ink , various kinds of paints , inked brushes , colored pencils , crayons , charcoal , chalk , pastels , various kinds of erasers , markers , styluses , and various metals ( such as silverpoint ) .

A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface , leaving a visible mark . The most common support for drawing is paper , although other materials , such as cardboard , wood , plastic , leather , canvas , and board , may be used . Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed almost anything . The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history . It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas . The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities .

  "/wiki/Photography": "Photography is the art , application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation , either electronically by means of an image sensor , or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film . It is employed in many fields of science , manufacturing ( e.g. , photolithography ) , and business , as well as its more direct uses for art , film and video production , recreational purposes , hobby , and mass communication . Typically , a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure . With an electronic image sensor , this produces an electrical charge at each pixel , which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing . The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image , which is later chemically developed into a visible image , either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing . A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base , known as a print , either by using an enlarger or by contact printing .",

  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",

Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978 . At its peak , the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers . Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks . In 1985 , Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show . Originally , Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show . Fearing the loss of ownership rights , Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family , the Simpson family , and named the members after his own parents and sisters - while Bart was an anagram of the word brat . The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons , which has since aired 674 episodes . In 1997 , Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama , an animated series about life in the year 3000 , which premiered in 1999 , running for four years on Fox , then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons .

  "/wiki/Theatre": "Theatre or theater [ a ] is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers , typically actors or actresses , to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place , often a stage . The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture , speech , song , music , and dance . Elements of art , such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality , presence and immediacy of the experience . The specific place of the performance is also named by the word theatre as derived from the Ancient Greek \u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ( th\u00e9atron , a place for viewing ) , itself from \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 ( the\u00e1omai , to see , to watch , to observe ) . Modern Western theatre comes , in large measure , from the theatre of ancient Greece , from which it borrows technical terminology , classification into genres , and many of its themes , stock characters , and plot elements . Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality , theatrical language , stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts , literature and the arts in general . [ b ] Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre . The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting , costumes and staging .

  "/wiki/Sculpture": "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process . A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving , assembled by welding or modelling , or molded or cast . Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost . Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in Central and South America and Africa . The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works ."
