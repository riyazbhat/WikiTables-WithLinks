Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting",
  "/wiki/September_11_attacks": "The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as 9/11 ) [ a ] were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday , September 11 , 2001 . The attacks resulted in 2,977 victim fatalities , over 25,000 injuries , and caused at least $ 10 billion in infrastructure and property damage . Additional people have died of 9/11-related cancer and respiratory diseases in the months and years following the attacks . Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers ( United Airlines and American Airlines ) - all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles - were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110-story towers collapsed . Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures . A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense ) in Arlington County , Virginia , which led to a partial collapse of the building 's west side . The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , was initially flown toward Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers thwarted the hijackers . 9/11 is the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed , respectively . Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda . The United States responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had failed to comply with U.S. demands to extradite Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan",

He was named as the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks in the 9/11 Commission Report . Sheikh Mohammed was a member of Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda organization , leading al-Qaeda 's propaganda operations from around 1999 until late 2001 . He confessed to FBI agents to a role in many of the most significant terrorist plots over the last twenty years , but his interrogators ' use of torture has caused many to question certain aspects of his confessions . Mohammed was captured on March 1 , 2003 , in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi by a combined operation of the US Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Pakistan 's Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) . Immediately after his capture , Mohammad was extraordinarily rendered to secret CIA prison sites in Afghanistan , then Poland , where he was interrogated by U.S. operatives . By December 2006 , he had been transferred to military custody at Guantanamo Bay detention camp . In March 2007 , after significant interrogations , Mohammed confessed to masterminding the September 11 attacks , the Richard Reid shoe bombing attempt to blow up an airliner , the Bali nightclub bombing in Indonesia , the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , the murder of Daniel Pearl , and various foiled attacks , as well as numerous other crimes . He was charged in February 2008 with war crimes and murder by a U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay detention camp which could carry the death penalty if convicted . In 2012 , a former military prosecutor criticized the proceedings as insupportable due to confessions gained under torture . A 2008 decision by the United States Supreme Court also drew into question the legality of the methods used to gain such admissions and the admissibility of such admissions as evidence in a criminal proceeding .

  "/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_253": "Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was an international passenger flight from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands , to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in the United States . The flight was the target of a failed al-Qaeda bombing attempt on Christmas Day , December 25 , 2009 , in which a passenger tried to set off chemical explosives sewn to his underwear . There were 290 people on board the aircraft - an Airbus A330-323E operated by Northwest Airlines , which had merged with Delta Air Lines the year before . Had the attempt succeeded , it would have surpassed American Airlines Flight 191 as the deadliest aviation occurrence on U.S. soil and tied Iran Air Flight 655 as the eighth-deadliest of all time . The incident was also the second in 2009 involving an Airbus A330 , after the crash of Air France Flight 447 on June 1 . This was also the final accident/incident involving Northwest Airlines as it closed down a month later when it merged with Delta Air Lines . The convicted bomber in the Christmas Day bombing attempt was 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a Nigerian man who had concealed plastic explosives in his underwear but failed to detonate them properly . A Dutch passenger , Jasper Schuringa , tackled and restrained him and put out the fire with the aid of others . Abdulmutallab was handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane . In all , three people were injured : Abdulmutallab , Schuringa , and one other passenger . Upon landing in Detroit , Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns . On December 28 , 2009 , al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing",

They are known to employ a variety of military tactics in addition to more unconventional methods , including terrorism . The FARC-EP was formed during the Cold War period as a Marxist-Leninist peasant force promoting a political line of agrarianism and anti-imperialism . The operations of the FARC-EP were funded by kidnap and ransom , illegal mining , extortion and taxation of various forms of economic activity , and the production and distribution of illegal drugs . The United Nations has estimated that 12 % of all civilians deaths in the Colombian conflict were committed by FARC and National Liberation Army ( ELN ) guerrillas , with 80 % committed by right-wing paramilitaries , and the remaining 8 % committed by Colombian security forces . The strength of the FARC-EP forces were high ; in 2007 , the FARC said they were an armed force of 18,000 men and women ; in 2010 , the Colombian military calculated that FARC forces consisted of about 13,800 members , 50 percent of whom were armed guerrilla combatants ; and , in 2011 , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said that FARC-EP forces comprised fewer than 10,000 members .

  "/wiki/Kidnapping": "In criminal law , kidnapping is the unlawful transportation , asportation and confinement of a person against their will . Thus , it is a composite crime . It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction , both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping . The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear . That is , the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle , but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly , e.g. , in the belief it is a taxicab . Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in exchange for releasing the victim , or for other illegal purposes . Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping .
