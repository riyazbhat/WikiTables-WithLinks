  "/wiki/In_Cold_Blood_(book)": "In Cold Blood is a non-fiction novel by American author Truman Capote , first published in 1966 ; it details the 1959 murders of four members of the Herbert Clutter family in the small farming community of Holcomb , Kansas . Capote learned of the quadruple murder before the killers were captured , and he traveled to Kansas to write about the crime . He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee , and they interviewed residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes . Killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith were arrested six weeks after the murders and later executed by the state of Kansas . Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book . In Cold Blood was an instant success and is the second-best-selling true crime book in history , behind Vincent Bugliosi 's Helter Skelter ( 1974 ) about the Charles Manson murders . Some critics consider Capote 's work the original non-fiction novel , although other writers had already explored the genre , such as Rodolfo Walsh in Operaci\u00f3n Masacre ( 1957 ) . In Cold Blood has been lauded for its eloquent prose , extensive detail , and triple narrative which describes the lives of the murderers , the victims , and other members of the rural community in alternating sequences . The psychologies and backgrounds of Hickock and Smith are given special attention , as is the pair 's complex relationship during and after the murders . In Cold Blood is regarded by critics as a pioneering work in the true crime genre , although Capote was disappointed that the book failed to win the Pulitzer Prize . Parts of the book differ from the real events , including important details .",

It was created in 1924 when Ogden Mills Reid of the New-York Tribune acquired the New York Herald . It was widely regarded as a writer 's newspaper and competed with The New York Times in the daily morning market . The paper won at least nine Pulitzer Prizes during its lifetime . [ a ] A Republican paper , a Protestant paper and a paper more representative of the suburbs than the ethnic mix of the city , according to one later reporter , the Tribune generally did not match the comprehensiveness of The New York Times ' coverage . Its national , international and business coverage , however , was generally viewed as among the best in the industry , as was its overall style . At one time or another , the paper was home to such writers as Dorothy Thompson , Red Smith , Roger Kahn , Richard Watts , Jr. , Homer Bigart , Walter Kerr , Walter Lippmann , St. Clair McKelway , Judith Crist , Dick Schaap , Tom Wolfe , John Steinbeck , and Jimmy Breslin . Editorially , the newspaper was the voice for eastern Republicans , later referred to as Rockefeller Republicans , and espoused a pro-business , internationalist viewpoint . The paper , first owned by the Reid family , struggled financially for most of its life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements ; the Reids subsidized the Herald Tribune through the paper 's early years . However , it enjoyed prosperity during World War II and by the end of the conflict had pulled close to the Times in ad revenue . A series of disastrous business decisions , combined with aggressive competition from the Times and poor leadership from the Reid family , left the Herald Tribune far behind its rival . In 1958 , the Reids sold the Herald Tribune to John Hay Whitney , a multimillionaire Wall Street investor who was serving as ambassador to the United Kingdom at the time .",

  "/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson": "Hunter Stockton Thompson ( July 18 , 1937 - February 20 , 2005 ) was an American journalist and author , and the founder of the gonzo journalism movement . He first rose to prominence with the publication of Hell 's Angels ( 1967 ) , a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of the lives and experiences of its members . In 1970 , he wrote an unconventional magazine feature titled The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for Scanlan 's Monthly which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with counterculture credibility . It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of New Journalism which he called Gonzo , which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative . Thompson remains best known for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( 1971 ) , a book first serialized in Rolling Stone in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement . It was adapted on film twice : loosely in Where the Buffalo Roam starring Bill Murray as Thompson in 1980 , and directly in 1998 by director Terry Gilliam in a film starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro . The Doonesbury cartoon character Duke - who was modeled after Thompson - pens an essay about my shoplifting conviction titled Fear and Loathing at Macy 's Menswear , a reference to Thompson 's book . Politically minded , Thompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County , Colorado in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket . He became well known for his dislike of Richard Nixon , who he claimed represented that dark , venal , and incurably violent side of the American character . He covered Nixon 's 1972 reelection campaign for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 . Thompson 's output notably declined from the mid-1970s , as he struggled with the consequences of fame , and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized . He was also known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal narcotics , his love of firearms , and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism .",

He later co-wrote a book with Ron Hall about amateur sailor Donald Crowhurst 's failed attempt to circumnavigate the world and subsequent suicide . His article The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong was included in Tom Wolfe 's collection The New Journalism , which was a collection of non-fiction pieces emblematic of a new movement of reporting aimed at revolutionising the field .

It is published by Times Newspapers Ltd , a subsidiary of News UK , which is in turn owned by News Corp. Times Newspapers also publishes The Times . The two papers were founded independently and have been under common ownership only since 1966 . They were bought by News International in 1981 . The Sunday Times occupies a dominant position in the quality Sunday market ; its circulation of just over 650,000 exceeds that of its main rivals , the Sunday Telegraph and the Observer , combined . While some other national newspapers moved to a tabloid format in the early 2000s , The Sunday Times has retained the larger broadsheet format and has said that it will continue to do so . As of December 2019 , it sells 75% more copies than its sister paper , The Times , which is published Monday to Saturday .
