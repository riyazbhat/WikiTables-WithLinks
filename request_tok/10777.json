  "/wiki/Tower_of_London": "The Tower of London , officially Her Majesty 's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London , is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London . It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite . The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ) , although that was not its primary purpose . A grand palace early in its history , it served as a royal residence . As a whole , the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion , mainly under kings Richard I , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site . The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history . It was besieged several times , and controlling it has been important to controlling the country . The Tower has served variously as an armoury , a treasury , a menagerie , the home of the Royal Mint , a public record office , and the home of the Crown Jewels of England .",

A journey of pilgrims to Becket 's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer 's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales . Canterbury is a popular tourist destination : consistently one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom , the city 's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism . The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent .

The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England , including several hundred tumuli ( burial mounds ) . Archaeologists believe it was constructed from 3000 BC to 2000 BC . The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch , which constitute the earliest phase of the monument , have been dated to about 3100 BC .

Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants , the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster , in central London , England . Its name , which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey , may refer to either of two structures : the Old Palace , a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834 , or its replacement , the New Palace that stands today . The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and , for ceremonial purposes , retains its original status as a royal residence . Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker . The first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century , and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512 . After that , it served as the home of the Parliament of England , which had met there since the 13th century , and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice , based in and around Westminster Hall . In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament , and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall , the Cloisters of St Stephen 's , the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft , and the Jewel Tower . In the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace , the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style , specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th-16th centuries . The remains of the Old Palace ( except the detached Jewel Tower ) were incorporated into its much larger replacement , which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 ( 1,210,680 sq ft ) .

In the following century , King William III 's massive rebuilding and expansion work , which was intended to rival the Palace of Versailles , destroyed much of the Tudor palace . His work ceased in 1694 , leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles , domestic Tudor and Baroque .

The palace , one of England 's largest houses , was built between 1705 and 1722 , and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 . The palace is named for the 1704 Battle of Blenheim , and thus ultimately after Blindheim ( also known as Blenheim ) in Bavaria . It was originally intended to be a reward to John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough for his military triumphs against the French and Bavarians in the War of the Spanish Succession , culminating in the Battle of Blenheim . The land was given as a gift , and construction began in 1705 , with some financial support from Queen Anne . The project soon became the subject of political infighting , with the Crown cancelling further financial support in 1712 , Marlborough 's three-year voluntary exile to the Continent , the fall from influence of his duchy and lasting damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh . Designed in the rare , and short-lived , English Baroque style , architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s . It is unique in its combined use as a family home , mausoleum and national monument . The palace is notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill .
