The design for the town was commissioned in the 1780s by the John Browne of the nearby stately home , Westport House , as a place for his workers and tenants to live . John Browne cleared the original village of Cahernamart , that had 700 inhabitants , to make way for his gardens at Westport House . The current town centre was originally designed by William Leeson in 1780 , in the Georgian architectural style . Its layout follows the medieval principles of urban design introduced by the Normans in the 13th century . A particular feature is the incorporation of the river into the composition , contained for two blocks by low stone walls producing , on each side of the river , tree lined promenades ( The Mall ) with several stone bridges over the river Carrow Beg . Some modern interventions , such as the Garda station , are less successful in maintaining the original continuity of the urban fabric . [ original research ? ]"
