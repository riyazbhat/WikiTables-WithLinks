It is the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland - the seat of the Archbishops of Armagh , the Primates of All Ireland for both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland . In ancient times , nearby Navan Fort ( Eamhain Mhacha ) was a pagan ceremonial site and one of the great royal capitals of Gaelic Ireland . Today , Armagh is home to two cathedrals ( both named after Saint Patrick ) and the Armagh Observatory , and is known for its Georgian architecture . Although classed as a medium-sized town , Armagh was given city status in 1994 and Lord Mayoralty status in 2012 , both by Queen Elizabeth II . It had a population of 14,777 people in the 2011 Census , making it the least-populated city in Ireland and the fifth smallest in the United Kingdom",
  "/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom": "City status in the United Kingdom is granted by the monarch of the United Kingdom to a select group of communities : as of 2014 [ update ] , there are 69 cities in the United Kingdom - 51 in England , six in Wales , seven in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland . The holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights . This appellation carries its own prestige and competition for the status is hard-fought . The status does not apply automatically on the basis of any particular criteria , though in England and Wales it was traditionally given to towns with diocesan cathedrals . This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when King Henry VIII founded dioceses ( each having a cathedral in the see city ) in six English towns and granted them city status by issuing letters patent . City status in Ireland was granted to far fewer communities than in England and Wales , and there are only two pre-19th-century cities in present-day Northern Ireland . In Scotland , city status did not explicitly receive any recognition by the state until the 19th century . At that time , a revival of grants of city status took place , first in England , where the grants were accompanied by the establishment of new cathedrals , and later in Scotland and Ireland . In the 20th century , it was explicitly recognised that the status of city in England and Wales would no longer be bound to the presence of a cathedral , and grants made since have been awarded to communities on a variety of criteria , including population size . The abolition of some corporate bodies as part of successive local-government reforms , beginning with the Municipal Corporations ( Ireland ) Act 1840 , has deprived some ancient cities of their status . However , letters patent have been issued for most of the affected cities to ensure the continuation or restoration of their status . At present , Rochester and Elgin are the only former cities in the United Kingdom",
  "/wiki/Letters_patent": "Letters patent ( always in the plural ) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch , president , or other head of state , generally granting an office , right , monopoly , title , or status to a person or corporation . Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices , or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms . Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown , such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms , as well as appointing a Royal Commission . In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm . A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent ( referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law ) granting exclusive rights in an invention ( or a design in the case of a design patent ) . In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to practice the invention , i.e. , put it into practical use . In the Holy Roman Empire , Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary , imperial patent was also the highest form of generally binding legal regulations , e. g. Patent of Toleration , Serfdom Patent etc . The opposite of letters patent are letters close ( Latin : litterae clausae ) , which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents . Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of open letter in that their audience is wide . It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee , for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace , who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse . Today , for example , it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain in the library of the House of Commons , where it may be freely perused by all members of parliament",
