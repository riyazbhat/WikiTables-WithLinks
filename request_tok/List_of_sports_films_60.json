The challenges involved in caving vary according to the cave being visited ; in addition to the total absence of light beyond the entrance , negotiating pitches , squeezes , and water hazards can be difficult . Cave diving is a distinct , and more hazardous , sub-speciality undertaken by a small minority of technically proficient cavers . In an area of overlap between recreational pursuit and scientific study , the most devoted and serious-minded cavers become accomplished at the surveying and mapping of caves and the formal publication of their efforts . These are usually published freely and publicly , especially in the UK and other European countries , although in the US , these are generally private .

  "/wiki/Freediver": "Freediving , free-diving , free diving , breath-hold diving , or skin diving is a form of underwater diving that relies on breath-holding until resurfacing rather than the use of breathing apparatus such as scuba gear . Besides the limits of breath-hold , immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure also have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in freediving . Examples of freediving activities are : traditional fishing techniques , competitive and non-competitive freediving , competitive and non-competitive spearfishing and freediving photography , synchronised swimming , underwater football , underwater rugby , underwater hockey , underwater target shooting and snorkeling . There are also a range of competitive apnea disciplines ; in which competitors attempt to attain great depths , times , or distances on a single breath . Historically , the term free diving was also used to refer to scuba diving , due to the freedom of movement compared with surface supplied diving ."
