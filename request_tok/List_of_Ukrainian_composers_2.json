He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century . Stravinsky 's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity . He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Serge Diaghilev and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes : The Firebird ( 1910 ) , Petrushka ( 1911 ) , and The Rite of Spring ( 1913 ) . The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky 's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design . His Russian phase which continued with works such as Renard , the Soldier 's Tale and Les Noces , was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassicism . The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ( concerto grosso , fugue and symphony ) , drawing on earlier styles , especially from the 18th century . In the 1950s , Stravinsky adopted serial procedures . His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output : rhythmic energy , the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells and clarity of form , and of instrumentation",
