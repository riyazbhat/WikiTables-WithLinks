From 1939 to 1945 , following its forced division and partial incorporation into Nazi Germany , the state did not de facto exist but its government-in-exile continued to operate . From 1948 to 1990 , Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc with a command economy . Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949 and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955 . A period of political liberalization in 1968 , known as the Prague Spring , was forcibly ended when the Soviet Union , assisted by several other Warsaw Pact countries , invaded Czechoslovakia . In 1989 , as Marxist-Leninist governments and socialism were ending all over Europe , Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the Velvet Revolution ; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation .

  "/wiki/Stanozolol": "Stanozolol ( abbrev . Stz ) , sold under many brand names , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) medication which was derived from dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , it is used to treat hereditary angioedema . It was developed by American pharmaceutical company Winthrop Laboratories ( Sterling Drug ) in 1962 , and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use , though it is no longer marketed in the USA . It is also used in veterinary medicine . Stanozolol has mostly been discontinued , and remains available in only a few countries . It is given by mouth in humans or by injection into muscle in animals . Unlike most injectable AAS , stanozolol is not esterified and is sold as an aqueous suspension , or in oral tablet form . The drug has a high oral bioavailability , due to a C17\u03b1 alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass liver metabolism when ingested . It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in tablet form . Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as performance-enhancing drugs and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) and many other sporting bodies . Additionally , stanozolol has been used in US horse racing .",
  "/wiki/Anabolic_steroids": "Anabolic steroids , also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone . They are anabolic and increase protein within cells , especially in skeletal muscles , and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects , including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair . The word anabolic , referring to anabolism , comes from the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae anabole , that which is thrown up , mound . Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization .",

Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . The Protestant Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars , the first of many conflicts with the Catholic Church . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618-20 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War .

  "/wiki/Human_growth_hormone": "Growth hormone ( GH ) or somatotropin , also known as human growth hormone ( hGH or HGH ) in its human form , is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth , cell reproduction , and cell regeneration in humans and other animals . It is thus important in human development . GH also stimulates production of IGF-1 and increases the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids . It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to the receptors on certain types of cells . GH is a 191-amino acid , single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized , stored and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland . A recombinant form of hGH called somatreopleopin ( INN ) is used as a prescription drug to treat children 's growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency . In the United States , it is only available legally from pharmacies by prescription from a licensed health care provider . In recent years in the United States , some health care providers are prescribing growth hormone in the elderly to increase vitality . While legal , the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial . Many of the functions of hGH remain unknown . In its role as an anabolic agent , HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982 , and has been banned by the IOC and NCAA . Traditional urine analysis does not detect doping with HGH , so the ban was not enforced until the early 2000s , when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed .",

Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine . Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use . The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia , Oceania , and in the United States , where racemic methamphetamine , levomethamphetamine , and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances . Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States .

While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug , racemic methamphetamine is sometimes illicitly produced due to the relative ease of synthesis and limited availability of chemical precursors . In low to moderate doses , methamphetamine can elevate mood , increase alertness , concentration and energy in fatigued individuals , reduce appetite , and promote weight loss . At very high doses , it can induce psychosis , breakdown of skeletal muscle , seizures and bleeding in the brain .",

At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",
  "/wiki/Biological_passport": "An athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes , in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time . Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athletes established levels outside permissible limits , rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances . Although the terminology athlete passport is recent , the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping . Maybe the first marker of doping , that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood , but through the induced deviations in biological parameters , is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio ( T/E ) . The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples . A decade later , in 1997 , markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations , such as the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) and the Federation Internationale de Ski , to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time . It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term athlete passport . The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency . Many believe [ who ? ] that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports . While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug , the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being . New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method .",

Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes .

Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812 , when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire ( to which Moldavia was a vassal state ) and became known as Bessarabia . In 1856 , southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia , which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania , but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878 . During the 1917 Russian Revolution , Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic , known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic . In February 1918 , the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly . The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia , which in 1924 established , within the Ukrainian SSR , a Moldavian autonomous republic ( MASSR ) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia . In 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union , leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Moldavian SSR ) , which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR ( east of the Dniester River ) .
