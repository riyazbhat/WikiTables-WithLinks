  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Voltage": "Voltage , electric potential difference , electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points . The difference in electric potential between two points ( i.e. , voltage ) in a static electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points . In the International System of Units , the derived unit for voltage is named volt . In SI units , work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb , where 1 volt = 1 joule ( of work ) per 1 coulomb ( of charge ) . The official SI definition for volt uses power and current , where 1 volt = 1 watt ( of power ) per 1 ampere ( of current ) . This definition is equivalent to the more commonly used 'joules per coulomb ' . Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolically by \u2206V , but more often simply as V , for instance in the context of Ohm 's or Kirchhoff 's circuit laws . Electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge , by electric current through a magnetic field , by time-varying magnetic fields , or some combination of these three . A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage ( or potential difference ) between two points in a system ; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points . A voltage may represent either a source of energy ( electromotive force ) or lost , used , or stored energy ( potential drop ) .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/NYC_S-Motor": "S-Motor was the class designation given by the New York Central to its ALCO-GE built S-1 , S-2 , S-2a and S-3 electric locomotives . The S-Motors hold the distinction of being the world 's first mass-produced main line electric locomotives with the prototype # 6000 being constructed in 1904 . The S-Motors would serve alone until the more powerful T-motors began to arrive in 1913 , eventually displacing them from main line passenger duties . From that point the class was assigned to shorter commuter trains and deadhead rolling stock between Grand Central Terminal and Mott Haven coach yard . Some examples , including the prototype later renumbered # 100 , would serve in this capacity through the Penn Central merger in 1968 , only being retired in the 1970s as long distance passenger traffic to Grand Central dried up .",
  "/wiki/New_York_Central_Railroad": "The New York Central Railroad ( reporting mark NYC ) was a railroad primarily operating in the Great Lakes and Mid Atlantic regions of the United States . The railroad primarily connected greater New York and Boston in the east with Chicago and St. Louis in the Midwest along with the intermediate cities of Albany , Buffalo , Cleveland , Cincinnati , and Detroit . New York Central was headquartered in New York City 's New York Central Building , adjacent to its largest station , Grand Central Terminal . The railroad was established in 1853 , consolidating several existing railroad companies . In 1968 the NYC merged with its former rival , the Pennsylvania Railroad , to form Penn Central . Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970 and merged into Conrail in 1976 . Conrail was broken up in 1998 , and portions of its system were transferred to CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway , with CSX acquiring most of the old New York Central trackage . Extensive trackage existed in the states of New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , Illinois , Massachusetts and West Virginia plus additional trackage in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . At the end of 1925 , the NYC operated 11,584 miles ( 18,643 km ) of road and 26,395 miles ( 42,479 km ) of track ; at the end of 1967 the mileages were 9,696 miles ( 15,604 km ) and 18,454 miles ( 29,699 km ) .",
  "/wiki/GN_boxcab_(3_phase)": "The GN boxcab locomotives were the first electric locomotives purchased by the Great Northern Railway ( GN ) for use through the Cascade Tunnel . Four locomotives were supplied by the American Locomotive Company ; they used electrical equipment from General Electric and weighed 115 short tons ( 104 t ) each . They were three-phase electric locomotives producing 1,500 hp ( 1,100 kW ) each . The specification called for 1000hp , but the actual output was substantially greater , as described by the consultant engineer Cary T. Hutchinson . They had a B-B wheel arrangement . They were built in February and March 1909 , and delivered in Pullman Green . The GN numbered them 5000-5003 and they were used until May 1927 . Initially three locomotives were coupled together and hauled trains at a constant speed of 15.7 mph ( 25.3 km/h ) , but when larger trains required four locomotives the motors were concatenated ( cascade control ) , so that the speed was halved to 7.8 mph ( 12.6 km/h ) to avoid overloading the power supply .",
  "/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_(U.S.)": "The Great Northern Railway ( reporting mark GN ) was an American Class I railroad . Running from Saint Paul , Minnesota , to Seattle , Washington , it was the creation of 19th-century railroad entrepreneur James J. Hill and was developed from the Saint Paul & Pacific Railroad . The Great Northern 's route was the northernmost transcontinental railroad route in the U.S . In 1970 the Great Northern Railway merged with three other railroads to form the Burlington Northern Railroad , which merged in 1996 with the , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway . The Great Northern was the only successfully built privately funded transcontinental railroad in U.S. history . No federal subsidies were used during its construction , unlike all other transcontinental railroads .",

  "/wiki/3_phase": "In electrical engineering , three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying alternating current voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period . A three-phase system may be arranged in delta ( \u2206 ) or star ( Y ) ( also denoted as wye in some areas ) . A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases , such as a 230/400 V system which provides 230 V between the neutral ( centre hub ) and any one of the phases , and 400 V across any two phases . A delta system arrangement only provides one voltage magnitude , but it has a greater redundancy as it may continue to operate normally with one of the three supply windings offline , albeit at 57.7% of total capacity . Harmonic current in the neutral may become very large if nonlinear loads are connected .",
  "/wiki/Alternating_current": "Alternating current ( AC ) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction , in contrast to direct current ( DC ) which flows only in one direction . Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences , and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances , televisions , fans and electric lamps into a wall socket . A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight . The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct , as when they modify current or voltage . The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave , whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa . In certain applications , like guitar amplifiers , different waveforms are used , such as triangular or square waves . Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current . These types of alternating current carry information such as sound ( audio ) or images ( video ) sometimes carried by modulation of an AC carrier signal . These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission .",
  "/wiki/New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad": "The New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad ( reporting mark NH ) , commonly known as the New Haven , was a railroad that operated in the New England region of the United States from 1872 to 1968 , dominating the region 's rail traffic for the first half of the 20th century . Beginning in the 1890s and accelerating in 1903 , New York banker J. P. Morgan sought to monopolize New England transportation by arranging the NH 's acquisition of 50 companies , including other railroads and steamship lines , and building a network of electrified trolley lines that provided interurban transportation for all of southern New England . By 1912 , the New Haven operated more than 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) of track , with 120,000 employees , and practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City . This quest for monopoly angered Progressive Era reformers , alienated public opinion , resulted in high prices for acquisitions , and increased construction costs . Debt soared from $ 14 million in 1903 to $ 242 million in 1913 , while the advent of automobiles , trucks and buses reduced railroad profits . Also in 1913 , the federal government filed an antitrust lawsuit that forced the NH to divest its trolley systems . The line became bankrupt in 1935 , was reorganized and reduced in scope , went bankrupt again in 1961 , and in 1969 was merged with the Penn Central system , formed a year earlier by the merger of the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad ; Already a poorly conceived merger , Penn Central proceeded to go bankrupt in 1970 , becoming the largest bankruptcy in the U.S. until the Enron Corporation superseded it in 2001 . The remnants of the system now comprise Metro-North Railroad 's New Haven Line , ( parts of ) Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor , Shore Line East , parts of the MBTA , and numerous freight operators such as CSX and the Providence and Worcester Railroad . The majority of the system is now owned publicly by the states of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts .",
  "/wiki/Hertz": "The hertz ( symbol : Hz ) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units ( SI ) and is defined as one cycle per second . It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz , the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves . Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples : kilohertz ( 103 Hz , kHz ) , megahertz ( 106 Hz , MHz ) , gigahertz ( 109 Hz , GHz ) , terahertz ( 1012 Hz , THz ) , petahertz ( 1015 Hz , PHz ) , exahertz ( 1018 Hz , EHz ) , and zettahertz ( 1021 Hz , ZHz ) . Some of the unit 's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones , particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications . It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven . The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy , via the photon energy equation ( E=h\u03bd ) , with one hertz equivalent to h joules .",

Electrical components were from General Electric . The locomotives were composed of two half-units semi-permanently coupled back-to-back , and numbered as one unit with ' A ' and ' B ' suffixes . As built , 30 locomotives were assigned to freight service , classified as EF-1 and numbered 10200-10229 . The remaining twelve locomotives were assigned to passenger service as class EP-1 , numbered 10100-10111 , with higher-speed passenger gearing . The design was highly successful , replacing a much larger number of steam locomotives , cutting costs and improving schedules . General Electric self-proclaimed this electric locomotive to be the King of the Rails in a silent promotional film from 1915 . In 1919 , with the arrival of a newer generation of passenger power , the EP-1 locomotives were converted to EF-1 freight locomotives , and renumbered 10230-10241 .

It was retired in November 1939 .",
  "/wiki/Milwaukee_Road_class_ES-2": "The Milwaukee Road 's class ES-2 comprised four electric switcher locomotives . Two were built in 1916 and the final two in 1919 . They were of steeplecab design , with a single roof-mounted pantograph to access the Milwaukee 's 3,000 V DC overhead line . Originally numbered 10050-10053 , they were renumbered E80-E83 in March 1939 . The ES-2 was the Milwaukee Road 's primary class of dedicated electric switchers . Electric switching on the Milwaukee Road was always limited to the Rocky Mountain Division , and to the middle and east end only , Avery being merely a power change , rather than a switching , location . Harlowton 's switching demands eventually exceeded the capabilities of the ES-2 , which was replaced in 1951 by a single GE Freight Motor ( later reclassed ES-3 ) instead ; thus from the 1950s to the 1970s the ES-2s were normally used only in the greater Butte area , in which the Deer Lodge shops were also located . The Coast Division eschewed electric switchers entirely , as its operating characteristics and economics were more favorable to otherwise underutilized steam ( later diesel ) switchers which also served the Milwaukee 's non-electrified branches in the area . Despite their highly specialized niche on the Milwaukee Road , the ES-2s were well-liked by personnel . Engineers liked them due to their rapid throttle response , preferring them over diesels which were slower to transition and accelerate . Their simple nature made them easy to service , and the units seldom needed major attention . Few changes were made to them over the years , the most important of which was the addition of extra steel plates , which added weight and reduced wheelslip .",
