  "/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations": "Boruto : Naruto Next Generations ( Japanese : BORUTO-\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8- -Naruto Next Generations- , Hepburn : Boruto : Naruto Nekusuto Jener\u0113shonzu ) is a Japanese manga series written by Uky\u014d Kodachi and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto . It was serialised monthly in Shueisha 's sh\u014dnen manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump since May 2016 until it was transferred to Shueisha 's monthly magazine V Jump in July 2019 . Boruto is a spin-off and a sequel to Masashi Kishimoto 's Naruto , which follows the exploits of Naruto Uzumaki 's son , Boruto Uzumaki , and his ninja team . Boruto originated from Shueisha 's proposal to Kishimoto on making a sequel to Naruto . However , Kishimoto rejected this offer and proposed his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto to draw it ; the writer of the film Boruto : Naruto the Movie , Uky\u014d Kodachi , created the plot . While both Kodachi and Ikemoto are in charge of the manga , Kodachi also oversees the anime 's adaptation alongside Kishimoto . An anime television series adaptation directed by Noriyuki Abe started airing on TV Tokyo on 5 April 2017 . Unlike the manga , which began as a retelling of the Boruto film , the anime begins as a prequel set before Boruto and his friends become ninjas in a later story arc . A series of light novels have also been written . Critical reception to the series has been largely positive ; most critics liked the traits of the main characters , most notably Boruto , who resembles his father , Naruto , but is spoiled and pampered and therefore faces different problems than Naruto did during childhood as a social pariah and an orphan . The story was also applauded for building up the original Naruto scenario by showing the new generation of ninjas and their relationships with their parents and mentors . Pierrot 's anime prequel also earned praise for its use of both new and returning characters .",
