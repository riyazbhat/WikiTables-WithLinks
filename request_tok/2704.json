It was intended to act as a reaction force to the Lebanese National Movement ( LNM ) of Kamal Jumblatt and other Left-Wing allies . The Lebanese Front was presided by the former president of Lebanon , Camille Chamoun , and its main participants were Pierre Gemayel , the founder and leader of the then-largest political party in Lebanon , the Kataeb Party , president Suleiman Frangieh , who had just finished his presidential years in office . It also included first class intellectuals , such as distinguished professor of philosophy and eminent diplomat Charles Malik who had been president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1958 , and Fouad Frem al-Boustani , the president of the Lebanese University . The front also included religious figures such as Father Charbel Qassis , who was later replaced by Father Bulus Naaman the head of the permanent congress of the Lebanese monastic orders . For a brief while the poet Said Aql was a member . As soon as the war erupted in Lebanon , and before the Lebanese Front was formed , many of the future leaders of the Lebanese Front organized their political parties into militias , most notably Camille Chamoun 's National Liberal Party , Pierre Gemayel 's influential longstanding Kataeb Party , and Suleiman Frangieh 's Marada Brigade . The number of men totalled around 18,000 , which was a relatively large number given that the total population of Lebanon was less than three million . However , the relations among the participants became tense mainly due to Frangieh 's pro-Syrian approach . In addition , in 1978 , Suleiman Frangieh 's son Tony and his family were killed by armed Kataeb militiamen trying to kidnap him acting on orders from Bashir Gemayel , the son of Pierre Gemayel . The incident is known as the Ehden massacre . It was this turning point that prompted Suleiman Frangieh to resign from the Front .",

It advocates the establishment of a Syrian nation state spanning the Fertile Crescent , including present day Syria , Lebanon , Iraq , Kuwait , Jordan , Palestine , Israel , Cyprus , Sinai , southeastern Turkey ( Alexandrette and Cilicia ) , based on geographical boundaries and the common history people within the boundaries share . With over 100,000 members as of 2016 , it is the second largest legal political group in Syria after the ruling Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , In Lebanon , it has been a major secular and highly organised elite party in the political history of the country for over 80 years . Until recent times it was a key group in the March 8 Alliance . Founded in Beirut in 1932 as an anticolonial and national liberation organization modeled on European fascist movements in order to oppose French colonialism , the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics and was involved in attempted coups d'etat in 1949 and 1961 following which it was thoroughly repressed . It was active in resistance against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000 while continuously supporting the Syrian presence in Lebanon out of both belief in Syrian irredentism but also due to the decades-long repression it endured at the hands of the Baath Party in Syria . In Syria , the SSNP had become a major Right-wing political force in the early 1950s , but was thoroughly repressed in 1955-56 . It remained organized , and by the late 1990s had joined the Left and allied itself with the PLO and the Lebanese Communist Party , despite the ideological rivalry that persists among them . In 2005 , it was legalized in Syria and joined the Ba'ath Party-led National Progressive Front . From 2012 to 6 May 2014 , the party was part of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation . During the course of the Syrian Civil War the party has seen its relevance increasing in Syria , where almost 12,000 fighters of the Party 's armed branch , the Eagles of the Whirlwind , fight alongside the Syrian Armed Forces against the Syrian opposition and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant .",

He was also Prime Minister from 1970 to 1971 , as well as Regional Secretary of the Regional Command of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party from 1970 to 2000 . Assad participated in the 1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat which brought the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party to power , and the new leadership appointed him Commander of the Syrian Air Force . In 1966 , Assad participated in a second coup , which toppled the traditional leaders of the Ba'ath Party and brought a radical military faction headed by Salah Jadid to power . Assad was appointed defense minister by the new government . Four years later , Assad initiated a third coup which ousted Jadid , and appointed himself as the undisputed leader of Syria . Assad de-radicalised the Ba'ath government when he took power by giving more space to private property and by strengthening the country 's foreign relations with countries which his predecessor had deemed reactionary . He sided with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in turn for support against Israel , and , while he had forsaken the pan-Arab concept of unifying the Arab world into one Arab nation , he sought to make Syria the defender of Arab interests against Israel . When he came to power , Assad organised state services along sectarian lines ( the Sunnis became the heads of political institutions , while the Alawites took control of the military , intelligence , and security apparatuses ) . The formerly collegial powers of Ba'athist decision-making were curtailed , and were transferred to the Syrian presidency . The Syrian government ceased to be a one-party system in the normal sense of the word , and was turned into a one-party state with a strong presidency . To maintain this system , a cult of personality centered on Assad and his family was created by the president and Ba'ath party .",
