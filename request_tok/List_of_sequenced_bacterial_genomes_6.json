  "/wiki/Anabaena": "Anabaena is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria that exist as plankton . They are known for nitrogen-fixing abilities , and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants , such as the mosquito fern . They are one of four genera of cyanobacteria that produce neurotoxins , which are harmful to local wildlife , as well as farm animals and pets . Production of these neurotoxins is assumed to be an input into its symbiotic relationships , protecting the plant from grazing pressure . A DNA sequencing project was undertaken in 1999 , which mapped the complete genome of Anabaena , which is 7.2 million base pairs long . The study focused on heterocysts , which convert nitrogen into ammonia . Certain species of Anabaena have been used on rice paddy fields , proving to be an effective natural fertilizer",
  "/wiki/Nostocales": "The Nostocales are an order of cyanobacteria containing most of its species . It includes filamentous forms , both simple or branched , and both those occurring as single strands or multiple strands within a sheath . Some members show a decrease in width from the base , and some have heterocysts . Environmentally , Nostocales ( Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides ) is largely disregarded and not widely studied . However , a recent study suggests that the invasive cyanobacterium is occupying temperate lakes and thriving in them . Using principal component analysis ( PCA ) and the Mann-Whitney U test , results showed that total phosphorus concentration was the primary causation for the increasing abundance of S.aphanizomenoides . Nostocales is known to grow in temperate environments consisting of poor light conditions and high phytoplankton biomass , commonly found in shallow lakes",
  "/wiki/Anabaena_variabilis": "Anabaena variabilis is a species of filamentous cyanobacterium . This species of the genus Anabaena and the domain Eubacteria is capable of photosynthesis . This species is also known to be heterotrophic in that it may grow without light in the presence of fructose . It also can convert atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia via nitrogen fixation . Anabaena variabilis is a phylogenic-cousin of the more well-known species Nostoc spirrilum . Both of these species along with many other cyanobacteria are known to form symbiotic relationships with plants . Other cyanobacteria are known to form symbiotic relationships with diatoms , though no such relationship has been observed with Anabaena variabilis . Anabaena variabilis is also a model organism for studying the beginnings of multicellular life due to its filamentous characterization and cellular-differentiation capabilities",
  "/wiki/Cyanobacteria": "Cyanobacteria /sa\u026a\u02cc\u00e6no\u028ab\u00e6k\u02c8t\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/ , also known as Cyanophyta , are a phylum consisting of free-living photosynthetic bacteria and the endosymbiotic plastids , a sister group to Gloeomargarita , that are present in some eukaryotes . They commonly obtain their energy through oxygenic photosynthesis . The oxygen gas in the atmosphere of earth is produced by cyanobacteria of this phylum , either as free-living bacteria or as the endosymbiotic plastids . The name cyanobacteria comes from the color of the bacteria ( Greek : \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 , romanized : kyan\u00f3s , lit . 'blue ' ) . Cyanobacteria , which are prokaryotes , are also called blue-green algae , though some modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes . Cyanobacteria appear to have originated in freshwater or a terrestrial environment . Unlike heterotrophic prokaryotes , cyanobacteria have internal membranes . These are flattened sacs called thylakoids where photosynthesis is performed . Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in cyanobacteria , acquired long ago via a process called endosymbiosis . These endosymbiotic cyanobacteria in eukaryotes then evolved and differentiated into specialized organelles such as chloroplasts , etioplasts and leucoplasts . By producing and releasing oxygen ( as a byproduct of photosynthesis ) , cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early oxygen-poor , reducing atmosphere into an oxidizing one , causing the Great Oxygenation Event and the rusting of the Earth , which dramatically changed the composition of the Earth 's life forms and led to the near-extinction of anaerobic organisms",

  "/wiki/Gloeobacter_violaceus": "Gloeobacter is a genus of cyanobacteria . It is the sister group to all other cyanobacteria .

Subsequently , the proton gradient in Gloeobacter is created over the plasma membrane , where it forms over the thylakoid membrane in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts . The whole genome of G. violaceus ( strain PCC 7421 ) and of G. kilaueensis have been sequenced . Many genes for photosystem I and II were found missing , likely related to the fact that photosynthesis in these bacteria does not take place in the thylakoid membrane as in other cyanobacteria , but in the plasma membrane",
