  "/wiki/Composite_Index_of_National_Capability": "The Composite Index of National Capability ( CINC ) is a statistical measure of national power created by J. David Singer for the Correlates of War project in 1963 . It uses an average of percentages of world totals in six different components . The components represent demographic , economic , and military strength . More recent studies tend to use the ( CINC ) score , which focuses on measures that are more salient to the perception of true state power beyond GDP . It is still among the best-known and most accepted methods for measuring national capabilities . The CINC only measures hard powers and may not represent soft powers or total national power",
  "/wiki/Hard_power": "Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies . This form of political power is often aggressive ( coercion ) , and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power . Hard power contrasts with soft power , which comes from diplomacy , culture and history . According to Joseph Nye , hard power involves the ability to use the carrots and sticks of economic and military might to make others follow your will . Here , carrots stand for inducements such as the reduction of trade barriers , the offer of an alliance or the promise of military protection . On the other hand , sticks represent threats - including the use of coercive diplomacy , the threat of military intervention , or the implementation of economic sanctions . Ernest Wilson describes hard power as the capacity to coerce another to act in ways in which that entity would not have acted otherwise",
  "/wiki/Soft_power": "Soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt , rather than coerce ( hard power ) . In other words , soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction . A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive ; the currency of soft power is culture , political values , and foreign policies . Recently , the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and lobbying through powerful political and non-political organizations , and through economic influence . In 2012 , Joseph Nye of Harvard University explained that with soft power , the best propaganda is not propaganda , further explaining that during the Information Age , credibility is the scarcest resource . Nye coined the term in a 1990 book , Bound to Lead : The Changing Nature of American Power . In this book , he wrote : when one country gets other countries to want what it wants might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants . He further developed the concept in his 2004 book , Soft Power : The Means to Success in World Politics . The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen . For example , United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security - diplomacy , strategic communications , foreign assistance , civic action and economic reconstruction and development . In 2011 , Xi Jinping was preparing to take power from General Secretary Hu Jintao , the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party devoted a whole plenary session to the issue of culture , with the final Communiqu\u00e9 declaring that it was a national goal to build our country into a socialist cultural superpower . And in 2014 , Xi announced , We should increase China 's soft power , give a good Chinese narrative , and better communicate China 's messages to the world",

  "/wiki/Small_arms": "A firearm is a gun ( a barreled ranged weapon ) designed to be readily carried and used by a single individual . It inflicts damage on targets by launching one or more projectiles driven by rapidly expanding high-pressure gas produced by exothermic combustion ( deflagration ) of chemical propellant . If gas pressurization is achieved through mechanical gas compression rather than through chemical propellant combustion , then the gun is technically an air gun , not a firearm . Some legal definitions of firearm are more broad , and may cover any and all projectile devices , or even other destructive devices . The first primitive firearms originated in 10th-century China when bamboo tubes containing gunpowder and pellet projectiles were mounted on spears into the one-person-portable fire lance , which was later used as a shock weapon to good effect in the Siege of De'an in 1132 . In the 13th century the Chinese invented the metal-barrelled hand cannon , widely considered [ by whom ? ] the true ancestor of all firearms . The technology gradually spread through the rest of East Asia , South Asia , the Middle East , and Europe . Older firearms typically used black powder as a propellant , but modern firearms use smokeless powder or other propellants . Most modern firearms ( with the notable exception of smoothbore shotguns ) have rifled barrels to impart spin to the projectile for improved flight stability . Modern firearms can be described by their caliber ( i.e . their bore diameter ; this is given in millimeters or inches e.g",

Its powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations and international sanctions as well as the authorization of military actions through resolutions - it is the only body of the United Nations with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states . The council held its first session on 17 January 1946 . Like the UN as a whole , the Security Council was created following World War II to address the failings of a previous international organization , the League of Nations , in maintaining world peace . In its early decades , the Security Council was largely paralyzed by the Cold War division between the US and USSR and their respective allies , though it authorized interventions in the Korean War and the Congo Crisis and peacekeeping missions in the Suez Crisis , Cyprus , and West New Guinea . With the collapse of the Soviet Union , UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale , and the Security Council authorized major military and peacekeeping missions in Kuwait , Namibia , Cambodia , Bosnia , Rwanda , Somalia , Sudan , and the Democratic Republic of Congo . The Security Council consists of fifteen members . The great powers that were the victors of World War II - the Soviet Union ( now represented by Russia ) , the United Kingdom , France , the former Republic of China ( now represented by the People 's Republic of China ) , and the United States - serve as the body 's five permanent members . These can veto any substantive resolution , including those on the admission of new member states or nominees for the office of Secretary-General . In addition , the council has 10 non-permanent members , elected on a regional basis to serve a term of two years . The body 's presidency rotates monthly among its members .

  "/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran": "There have been a number of sanctions against Iran imposed by a number of countries , especially the United States , and international entities . The first sanctions were those imposed by the United States in November 1979 after a group of radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and took the people inside hostage . The sanctions by Executive Order 12170 included freezing about $ 12 billion in Iranian assets , including bank deposits , gold and other properties , and a trade embargo . These sanctions were lifted in January 1981 as part of the Algiers Accords , which was a negotiated settlement of the hostages release . The second sanctions by the United States were imposed under Ronald Reagan in 1987 because of Iran 's actions from 1981-1987 against the U.S. and other shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf and support for terrorism . The sanctions were expanded in 1995 to include firms dealing with the Iranian government . The third sanctions were imposed in December 2006 pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1737 after Iran refused to comply with UNSC Resolution 1696 which demanded that Iran halt its uranium enrichment program . Initially , U.S. sanctions targeted investments in oil , gas , and petrochemicals , exports of refined petroleum products , and business dealings with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) . It encompassed banking and insurance transactions ( including with the Central Bank of Iran ) , shipping , web-hosting services for commercial endeavors , and domain name registration services . Subsequent UN Resolutions have expanded sanctions against Iran . Over the years , sanctions have taken a serious toll on Iran 's economy and people .

Iraq wanted to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state , and was worried the 1979 Iranian Revolution would lead Iraq 's Shi'ite majority to rebel against the Ba'athist government . The war also followed a long history of border disputes , and Iraq planned to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province and the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab ( Arvand Rud ) . Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran 's post-revolutionary chaos , it made limited progress and was quickly repelled ; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982 . For the next six years , Iran was on the offensive until near the end of the war . There were a number of proxy forces - most notably the People 's Mujahedin of Iran siding with Iraq and the Iraqi Kurdish militias of the KDP and PUK siding with Iran . The United States , Britain , the Soviet Union , France , and most Arab countries provided political and logistic support for Iraq , while Iran was largely isolated . After eight years , war-weariness , economic problems , decreased morale , repeated Iranian military failures , recent Iraqi successes , lack of international sympathy for the Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction against civillians , and increased U.S.-Iran military tension all led to a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations . The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used , including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines , manned machine gun posts , bayonet charges , Iranian human wave attacks , extensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq , and , later , deliberate attacks on civilian targets . A special feature of the war can be seen in the Iranian cult of the martyr which had been developed in the years before the revolution . The discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shiite context led to the tactics of human wave attacks and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the war . An estimated 500,000 Iraqi and Iranian soldiers died , in addition to a smaller number of civilians",
  "/wiki/Offensive_(military)": "An offensive is a military operation that seeks through an aggressive projection of armed forces to occupy territory , gain an objective or achieve some larger strategic , operational , or tactical goal . Another term for an offensive often used by the media is 'invasion ' , or the more general 'attack ' . The offensive was considered [ when ? ] a pre-eminent means of producing victory , although with the recognition of a defensive phase at some stage of the execution . A quick guide to the size or scope of the offensive is to consider the number of troops involved in the side initiating the offensive . Offensives are largely conducted as a means to secure initiative in a confrontation between opponents . They can be waged on land , at sea or in the air . Naval offensives , such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , can have wide-ranging implications for national strategies and require a significant logistical commitment to destroy enemy naval capabilities . It can also be used to interdict enemy shipping , such as World War II 's Battle of the Atlantic . Naval offensives can also be tactical , such as Operation Coronado IX conducted by the United States Navy 's Mobile Riverine Force during the Vietnam War . An air offensive is an operation that can describe any number of different types of operations , usually restricted to specific types of aircraft . The offensives conducted with the use of fighter aircraft are predominantly concerned with establishing air superiority in a given air space , or over a given territory",

Nader 's forces defeated the army of Muhammad Shah within three hours , despite being heavily outnumbered ( six-to-one ) , paving the way for the Persian sack of Delhi . The engagement is considered the crowning jewel in Nader 's military career as well as a tactical masterpiece . The battle took place near Karnal , 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) north of Delhi , India . The battle was the culminating point of Nader Shah 's invasion of the Mughal Empire . After his conquest of eastern Afghanistan and invasion via Kabul and Peshawar , Nader led his forces south towards the Mughal capital . At Delhi Muhammad Shah gathered an extremely large force with which he marched north before his cumbersome army ground to a halt at Karnal . Nader gave battle and won a crushing victory . In the negotiations following the catastrophic defeat , Muhammad Shah agreed to pay a large indemnity in exchange for maintaining his imperium over his lands . Nader however , forced the Mughal emperor to submit utterly and marched him to his capital , Delhi , where the Mughal treasury was plundered . An uprising against Nader 's soldiers by Delhi 's citizens ended in a bloody massacre where the entire city was sacked and looted . The enormous plunder gained in Delhi caused Nader to issue an imperial decree removing all taxes for a total of three years",

It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping",
  "/wiki/Peacekeeping": "Peacekeeping comprises activities intended to create conditions that favour lasting peace . Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare . Within the United Nations ( UN ) group of nation-state governments and organisations , there is a general understanding that at the international level , peacekeepers monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas , and may assist ex-combatants in implementing peace agreement commitments that they have undertaken . Such assistance may come in many forms , including confidence-building measures , power-sharing arrangements , electoral support , strengthening the rule of law , and economic and social development . Accordingly , the UN peacekeepers ( often referred to as Blue Berets or Blue Helmets because of their light blue berets or helmets ) can include soldiers , police officers , and civilian personnel . The United Nations is not the only organisation to implement peacekeeping missions . Non-UN peacekeeping forces include the NATO mission in Kosovo ( with United Nations authorisation ) and the Multinational Force and Observers on the Sinai Peninsula or the ones organised by the European Union ( like EUFOR RCA , with UN authorisation ) and the African Union ( like the African Union Mission in Sudan ) . The Nonviolent Peaceforce is one NGO widely considered to have expertise in general peacemaking by non-governmental volunteers or activists . Under international law , peacekeepers are non-combatants due to their neutral stance in the conflict between two or more belligerent parties ( to the same extent as neutral personnel and properties outside of peacekeeping duties ) and are to be protected from attacks at all times",
  "/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance": "Unexploded ordnance ( UXO , sometimes abbreviated as UO ) , unexploded bombs ( UXBs ) , or explosive remnants of war ( ERW ) are explosive weapons ( bombs , shells , grenades , land mines , naval mines , cluster munition , etc . ) that did not explode when they were employed and still pose a risk of detonation , sometimes many decades after they were used or discarded . UXO does not always originate from wars ; areas such as military training grounds can also hold significant numbers , even after the area has been abandoned . UXO from World War I continue to be a hazard , with poisonous gas filled munitions still a problem . When unwanted munitions are found , they are sometimes destroyed in controlled explosions , but accidental detonation of even very old explosives also occurs , sometimes with fatal results . Seventy-eight countries are contaminated by land mines , which kill or maim 15,000-20,000 people every year . Approximately 80 % of casualties are civilian , with children the most affected age group . An estimated average of 50 % of deaths occurs within hours of the blast . In recent years , mines have been used increasingly as weapons of terror against local civilian populations specifically . In addition to the obvious danger of explosion , buried UXO can cause environmental contamination . In some heavily used military training areas , munitions-related chemicals such as explosives and perchlorate ( a component of pyrotechnics and rocket fuel ) can enter soil and groundwater",
