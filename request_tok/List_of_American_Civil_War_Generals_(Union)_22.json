The battle was tactically inconclusive , as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive . Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania , but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him . On the morning of May 5 , the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren attacked the Confederate Second Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell , on the Orange Turnpike . That afternoon the Third Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill , encountered Brig . Gen. George W. Getty 's division ( VI Corps ) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock 's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road . Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides attempted to maneuver in the dense woods . At dawn on May 6 , Hancock attacked along the Plank Road , driving Hill 's Corps back in confusion , but the First Corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet arrived in time to prevent the collapse of the Confederate right flank . Longstreet followed up with a surprise flanking attack from an unfinished railroad bed that drove Hancock 's men back to the Brock Road , but the momentum was lost when Longstreet was wounded by his own men . An evening attack by Brig . Gen. John B. Gordon against the Union right flank caused consternation at Union headquarters , but the lines stabilized and fighting ceased",

A Union force known as the Army of the Tennessee ( Major General Ulysses S. Grant ) had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing on the west bank of the Tennessee River , where the Confederate Army of Mississippi ( General Albert Sidney Johnston , P. G. T. Beauregard second-in-command ) launched a surprise attack on Grant 's army from its base in Corinth , Mississippi . Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting ; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening . Overnight , Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the Army of the Ohio ( Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell ) . The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day . On April 6 , the first day of the battle , the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west . Johnston hoped to defeat Grant 's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio .
