  "/wiki/Cornell_University": "Cornell University ( /k\u0254\u02d0r\u02c8n\u025bl/ kor-NEL ) is a private and statutory Ivy League research university in Ithaca , New York . Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White , the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge - from the classics to the sciences , and from the theoretical to the applied . These ideals , unconventional for the time , are captured in Cornell 's founding principle , a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation : I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study . The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus , with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy . The university also administers two satellite medical campuses , one in New York City and one in Education City , Qatar , and Cornell Tech , a graduate program that incorporates technology , business , and creative thinking . The program moved from Google 's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017 . Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York . [ note 1 ] Of its seven undergraduate colleges , three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system , including its agricultural and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school . Of Cornell 's graduate schools , only the veterinary college is state-supported . As a land grant college , Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions . The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres , but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens ( more than 4,300 acres ) and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered . As of October 2019 , 59 Nobel laureates , four Turing Award winners and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Cornell University ."
