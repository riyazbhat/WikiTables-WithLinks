  "/wiki/Detachable_chairlift": "A detachable chairlift or high-speed chairlift is a type of passenger aerial lift , which , like a fixed-grip chairlift , consists of numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire rope ( called a haul rope ) that is strung between two ( or more ) terminals over intermediate towers . They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts . Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation . The significance of detachable chairlift technology is primarily the speed and capacity . Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren , averaging 1,000 feet per minute ( 11.3 mph , 18 km/h , 5.08 m/s ) versus a typical fixed-grip speed of 500 ft/min ( 5.6 mph , 9 km/h , 2.54 m/s ) . Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load , each chair is connected to the cable by a powerful spring-loaded cable grip which detaches at terminals , allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min ( 2 mph , 4 km/h , 1 m/s ) , a speed slower even than fixed-grip bunny chairlifts . Another advantage of detaching chairs is the ability to remove chairs during severe weather in order to reduce stress on the rope and towers . Furthermore , operating the unladen rope during extreme weather is effective at preventing - or greatly reducing - ice and snow accumulation on the sheaves and rope . This saves considerable time , expense and hazard when opening the chair for operation , which would otherwise require workers to climb each tower and chip away ice and shovel snow . Chairlifts are made in a variety of sizes , carrying from 1 to 8 passengers . All chairs on a given chairlift usually have the same capacity . Slang terms for the different sizes include single , double , triple , quad , six pack , and eight",

  "/wiki/Chairlift": "An elevated passenger ropeway , or chairlift , is a type of aerial lift , which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers , carrying a series of chairs . They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas ( in such cases referred to as 'skilifts ' ) , but are also found at amusement parks , various tourist attractions , and increasingly in urban transport . Depending on carrier size and loading efficiency , a passenger ropeway can move up to 4000 people per hour , and the fastest lifts achieve operating speeds of up to 12 m/s ( 39.4 ft/s ) or 43.2 km/h ( 26.8 mph ) . The two-person double chair , which for many years was the workhorse of the ski industry , can move roughly 1200 people per hour at rope speeds of up to 2.5 m/s ( 8.2 ft/s ) . The four person detachable chairlift ( high-speed quad ) can transport 2400 people per hour with an average rope speed of 5 m/s ( 16.4 ft/s ) . Some bi and tri cable elevated ropeways and reversible tramways achieve much greater operating speeds",
  "/wiki/Riblet": "The Riblet Tramway Company of Spokane , Washington , which operated from 1908 to 2003 , was once the largest ski chairlift manufacturer in the world . The company was founded by Byron Christian Riblet , who was born in Osage , Iowa , in 1865 and earned a degree in Civil Engineering . Arriving in Spokane in 1885 , his first work was laying out railway and streetcar lines . He also built dams and irrigation projects . In 1896 , Riblet was contracted to erect a Finlayson ore [ clarification needed ] tramway at the Noble Five silver mine in Sandon , British Columbia , to assist in moving ore down Reco Mountain to the mill at Cody . Apparently Riblet thought he was coming to build a streetcar line . Even so , Riblet decided he could improve the mining tram performance . Over time , Riblet raised more aerial tramways in the booming mining district , building 30 in the next decade . Riblet returned to Spokane in 1908 , after working in the Kootenays , to found the Riblet Tramway Company . The company , which specialized in mining tramways , built them in Alaska , Canada , the western United States , and South America . Riblet built its first chairlift in 1938 at Mount Hood , Oregon . Byron Riblet died in 1952 , but the company boomed with the postwar rise of ski resorts",
