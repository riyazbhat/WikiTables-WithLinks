  "/wiki/Weird_Tales": "Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922 . The first issue , dated March 1923 , appeared on newsstands February 18 . The first editor , Edwin Baird , printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft , Seabury Quinn , and Clark Ashton Smith , all of whom would go on to be popular writers , but within a year the magazine was in financial trouble . Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher , Rural Publishing Corporation , to Lansinger and refinanced Weird Tales , with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor . The first issue under Wright 's control was dated November 1924 . The magazine was more successful under Wright , and despite occasional financial setbacks it prospered over the next fifteen years . Under Wright 's control the magazine lived up to its subtitle , The Unique Magazine , and published a wide range of unusual fiction . Lovecraft 's Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in Weird Tales , starting with The Call of Cthulhu in 1928 . These were well-received , and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu . Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor , and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine , and Seabury Quinn 's series of stories about Jules de Grandin , a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural , was very popular with the readers . Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis , E. Hoffmann Price , Robert Bloch , and H. Warner Munn . Wright published some science fiction , along with the fantasy and horror , partly because when Weird Tales was launched there were no magazines specializing in science fiction , but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as Amazing Stories in 1926",

  "/wiki/The_Magazine_of_Fantasy_&_Science_Fiction": "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction ( usually referred to as F & SF ) is a U.S. fantasy and science fiction magazine first published in 1949 by Fantasy House , a subsidiary of Lawrence Spivak 's Mercury Press . Editors Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas had approached Spivak in the mid-1940s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak 's existing mystery title , Ellery Queen 's Mystery Magazine . The first issue was titled The Magazine of Fantasy , but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy , and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue . F & SF was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day , most of which were in pulp format : it had no interior illustrations , no letter column , and text in a single column format , which in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley set F & SF apart , giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine . F & SF quickly became one of the leading magazines in the science fiction and fantasy field , with a reputation for publishing literary material and including more diverse stories than its competitors . Well-known stories that appeared in its early years include Richard Matheson 's Born of Man and Woman , and Ward Moore 's Bring the Jubilee , a novel of an alternative history in which the South has won the American Civil War . McComas left for health reasons in 1954 , but Boucher continued as sole editor until 1958 , winning the Hugo Award for Best Magazine that year , a feat his successor , Robert Mills , repeated in the next two years . Mills was responsible for publishing Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes , Rogue Moon by Algis Budrys , Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein , and the first of Brian Aldiss 's Hothouse stories . The first few issues mostly featured cover art by George Salter , Mercury Press 's art director , but other artists soon began to appear , including Chesley Bonestell , Kelly Freas , and Ed Emshwiller . In 1962 , Mills was succeeded as editor by Avram Davidson . When Davidson left at the end of 1964 , Joseph Ferman , who had bought the magazine from Spivak in 1954 , took over briefly as editor , though his son Edward soon began doing the editorial work under his father 's supervision . At the start of 1966 Edward Ferman was listed as editor , and four years later he acquired the magazine from his father and moved the editorial offices to his house in Connecticut",
