When the ban was imposed , South Africa had developed to a point where its team including Eddie Barlow , Graeme Pollock and Mike Procter was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia . The ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time . The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings ( had best ranking of No.1 in all three formats ) but has lacked success in ICC organised tournaments .

The Christchurch urban area lies on the South Island 's east coast , just north of Banks Peninsula . The urban area is home to 377,200 residents , and the territorial authority has 385,500 people , which makes it the second-most populous city in New Zealand after Auckland and before Wellington . The Avon River flows through the centre of the city , with an urban park located along its banks . Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250 . Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856 , making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand . The Canterbury Association , which settled the Canterbury Plains , named the city after Christ Church , Oxford . The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square ; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area , except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south . Agriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch 's economy . The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city 's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries . Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities ' for Antarctic exploration , hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations . The city suffered a series of earthquakes between September 2010 and January 2012 , with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday , 22 February 2011 , in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage .",

It lies on the River Stour . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion owing to the importance of St Augustine , who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent around the turn of the 7th century . The city 's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket , although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012 . A journey of pilgrims to Becket 's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer 's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales . Canterbury is a popular tourist destination : consistently one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom , the city 's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism . The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent . Many historical structures fill the area , including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century , the ruins of St Augustine 's Abbey and a Norman castle , and the oldest extant school in the world , the King 's School . Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and the St Lawrence Ground , home of the Kent County Cricket Club . There is also a substantial student population , brought about by the presence of the University of Kent , Canterbury Christ Church University , the University for the Creative Arts , and the Girne American University Canterbury campus . Canterbury remains , however , a small city in terms of geographical size and population , when compared with other British cities .",

The city has a population of 105,471 . In terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia . Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales , the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement . Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851 , and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted . Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat . Proclaimed a city in 1871 , its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century , after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction .

In its first fifty years of international cricket , India was one of the weaker teams , winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played . The team , however , gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen Gavaskar , Viswanath , Kapil Dev , and the Indian spin quartet . Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad , the Indian team has improved its overseas form , especially in limited-overs cricket , since the start of the 21st century , winning Test matches in Australia , England and South Africa . It has won the Cricket World Cup twice - in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in 2011 under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni .

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",
