The series , written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George P\u00e9rez , was first serialized as a 12-issue limited series from April 1985 to March 1986 . As the main piece of a crossover event , some plot elements were featured in tie-in issues of other publications . Since its initial publication , the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions . The idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman 's desire to abandon the DC Multiverse depicted in the company 's comics - which he thought was unfriendly to readers - and create a single , unified DC Universe ( DCU ) . The foundation of Crisis on Infinite Earths developed through a character ( the Monitor ) introduced in Wolfman 's The New Teen Titans in July 1982 before the series itself started . P\u00e9rez was not the intended artist for the series , but was excited when he learned of it and called illustrating it some of the most fun he ever had . At the start of Crisis on Infinite Earths , the Anti-Monitor ( the Monitor 's evil counterpart ) is unleashed on the DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises . The Monitor tries to recruit heroes from around the Multiverse but is murdered , while Brainiac collaborates with the villains to conquer the remaining Earths . However , both the heroes and villains are eventually united by the Spectre ; the series concludes with Kal-L , Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr. defeating the Anti-Monitor and the creation of a single Earth in place of the Multiverse . Crisis on Infinite Earths is noted for its high death count ; hundreds of characters died , including DC icons Kara Zor-El ( the original Supergirl ) and Barry Allen ( the Flash of the Silver Age ) . The story 's events resulted in the entire DCU being rebooted",
  "/wiki/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books": "The Silver Age of Comic Books was a period of artistic advancement and widespread commercial success in mainstream American comic books , predominantly those featuring the superhero archetype . Following the Golden Age of Comic Books and an interregnum in the early to mid-1950s , the Silver Age is considered to cover the period from 1956 to circa 1970 , and was succeeded by the Bronze and Modern Ages . The popularity and circulation of comic books about superheroes had declined following World War II , and comic books about horror , crime and romance took larger shares of the market . However , controversy arose over alleged links between comic books and juvenile delinquency , focusing in particular on crime , horror , and superheroes turning them into glorified firefighters . In 1954 , publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content . In the wake of these changes , publishers began introducing superhero stories again , a change that began with the introduction of a new version of DC Comics ' The Flash in Showcase # 4 ( October 1956 ) . In response to strong demand , DC began publishing more superhero titles including Justice League of America , which prompted Marvel Comics to follow suit beginning with The Fantastic Four # 1 . A number of important comics writers and artists contributed to the early part of the era , including writers Stan Lee , Gardner Fox , John Broome , and Robert Kanigher , and artists Curt Swan , Jack Kirby , Gil Kane , Steve Ditko , Mike Sekowsky , Gene Colan , Carmine Infantino , John Buscema , and John Romita , Sr. By the end of the Silver Age , a new generation of talent had entered the field , including writers Denny O'Neil , Gary Friedrich , Roy Thomas , and Archie Goodwin , and artists such as Neal Adams , Herb Trimpe , Jim Steranko , and Barry Windsor-Smith .

Barry Allen is a reinvention of a previous character called the Flash , who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Jay Garrick . Because he is a speedster , his power consists mainly of superhuman speed .

The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance , traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring . Barry Allen 's classic stories introduced the concept of the Multiverse to DC Comics , and this concept played a large part in DC 's various continuity reboots over the years . The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC 's major company-wide reboot stories , and in the crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths # 8 ( Nov. 1985 ) , Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse , removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years . His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative ( and a single image of a blur ) in Grant Morrison 's crossover story Final Crisis : Rogues ' Revenge # 3 ( Nov. 2008 ) , fully actualized in Geoff Johns ' accompanying The Flash : Rebirth # 1 ( June 2009 ) , kicking off a six-issue limited series .

Allen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash , being present in numerous media adaptations , one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes .

Jordan uses this power to fly , even through the vacuum of space ; to create shields , swords , and lasers ; and to construct his Green Lantern costume , which protects his secret identity in his civilian life on Earth . Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious Guardians of the Universe , who were developed from an idea editor Julius Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring Captain Comet in Strange Adventures # 22 ( July 1952 ) entitled Guardians of the Clockwork Universe .

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries .

It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other .

Nicknamed the Scarlet Speedster , all incarnations of the Flash possess super speed , which includes the ability to run , move , and think extremely fast , use superhuman reflexes , and seemingly violate certain laws of physics . Thus far , at least four different characters - each of whom somehow gained the power of the speed force - have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC 's history : college athlete Jay Garrick ( 1940-1951 , 1961-2011 , 2017-present ) , forensic scientist Barry Allen ( 1956-1985 , 2008-present ) , Barry 's nephew Wally West ( 1986-2011 , 2016-present ) , and Barry 's grandson Bart Allen ( 2006-2007 ) .

The Flash is one of DC Comics ' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher 's many reality-changing crisis storylines over the years . The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in Flash of Two Worlds ( 1961 ) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers , which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come .

About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics",
  "/wiki/Apartheid": "Apartheid ( South African English : /\u0259\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0rte\u026ad/ ; Afrikaans : [ a\u02c8part\u0266\u025bit ] , segregation ; lit . aparthood ) was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa ( now Namibia ) from 1948 until the early 1990s . [ note 1 ] Apartheid was characterised by an authoritarian political culture based on baasskap ( or white supremacy ) , which ensured that South Africa was dominated politically , socially , and economically by the nation 's minority white population . According to this system of social stratification , white citizens had the highest status , followed in descending order by Asians , Coloureds , and black Africans . The economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day . Broadly speaking , apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid , which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events , and grand apartheid , which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race . Prior to the 1940s , some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black Africans from other races , which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment . Apartheid was adopted as a formal policy by the South African government after the ascension of the National Party ( NP ) during the 1948 general elections . A codified system of racial stratification began to take form in South Africa under the Dutch Empire in the eighteenth century , although informal segregation was present much earlier due to social cleavages between Dutch colonists and a creolised , ethnically diverse slave population . With the rapid growth and industrialisation of the British Cape Colony in the nineteenth century , racial policies and laws became increasingly rigid . Cape legislation that discriminated specifically against black Africans began appearing shortly before 1900 . The policies of the Boer republics were also racially exclusive ; for instance , the Transvaal 's constitution barred black African and Coloured participation in church and state",
  "/wiki/Atlantis": "Atlantis ( Ancient Greek : \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 , island of Atlas ) is a fictional island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato 's works Timaeus and Critias , where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges Ancient Athens , the pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato 's ideal state in The Republic . In the story , Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world , supposedly giving testament to the superiority of Plato 's concept of a state . The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean . Despite its minor importance in Plato 's work , the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature . The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers , such as Francis Bacon 's New Atlantis and Thomas More 's Utopia . On the other hand , nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato 's narrative as historical tradition , most famously in Ignatius L. Donnelly 's Atlantis : The Antediluvian World . Plato 's vague indications of the time of the events - more than 9,000 years before his time - and the alleged location of Atlantis - beyond the Pillars of Hercules - has led to much pseudoscientific speculation . As a consequence , Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction , from comic books to films . While present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story 's fictional character , there is still debate on what served as its inspiration . As for instance with the story of Gyges , Plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions . This led a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption , the Sea Peoples invasion , or the Trojan War . Others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that Plato created an entirely fictional nation as his example , drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415-413 BC or the destruction of Helike in 373 BC",

Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston ( pen name : Charles Moulton ) , and artist Harry G. Peter .

Marston 's comics featured his ideas on DISC theory , and the character drew a great deal of inspiration from early feminists , and especially from birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger ; in particular , her piece Woman and the New Race . Wonder Woman 's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life to live as an Amazon , along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods . In recent years , DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta , jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe . The character has changed in depiction over the decades , including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s ; by the 1980s , artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage",

His expeditions , sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain , were the first European contact with the Caribbean , Central America , and South America . Columbus 's early life is somewhat obscure , but scholars generally agree that he was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language . He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely , as far north as the British Isles ( and possibly Iceland ) and as far south as what is now Ghana . He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years , but later took a Castilian mistress ; he had one son with each woman . Though largely self-educated , Columbus was widely read in geography , astronomy , and history . He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies , hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade . Following persistent lobbying , Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west , in the name of the Crown of Castile . Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships , and after a stopover in the Canary Islands made landfall in the Americas on 12 October ( later celebrated as Columbus Day ) . His landing place was an island in the Bahamas , known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani ; its exact location is uncertain . Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola , establishing a colony in what is now Haiti - the first European settlement in the Americas since the Norse colonies nearly 500 years earlier .

Originally , Booth and his small group of conspirators had plotted to kidnap Lincoln , but they later agreed to murder him as well as Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward , likewise to aid the Confederate cause . Although its Army of Northern Virginia , commanded by General Robert E. Lee , had surrendered to the Union Army four days earlier , Booth believed that the Civil War remained unresolved because the Confederate army of General Joseph E. Johnston continued fighting . Booth shot President Lincoln once in the back of the head . Lincoln 's death the next morning completed Booth 's piece of the plot . Seward , severely wounded , recovered , whereas Vice President Johnson was never attacked . Booth fled on horseback to southern Maryland and , 12 days later , at a farm in rural northern Virginia , was tracked down sheltered in a barn .

Congressman from Illinois . In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act . He reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new Republican Party and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas . Lincoln ran for President in 1860 , sweeping the North in victory . Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North 's rejection of their right to practice slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union . To secure its independence , the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in the South , and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union .

Kennedy was a brother of President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General and U.S . Senator Robert F. Kennedy - both victims of assassination - and was the father of Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy . After attending Harvard University and receiving his law degree from the University of Virginia , he began his career as an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County , Massachusetts . Kennedy was 30 years old when he first entered the Senate following a November 1962 special election in Massachusetts to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother John , who had taken office as the president . He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times .

  "/wiki/Chappaquiddick_incident": "The Chappaquiddick incident ( popularly known as Chappaquiddick ) was a single-vehicle car accident on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts some time around midnight between Friday , July 18 , and Saturday , July 19 , 1969 . The accident was caused by Senator Edward M. ( Ted ) Kennedy 's negligence and resulted in the death of his 28-year-old passenger Mary Jo Kopechne , who was trapped inside the vehicle . Kennedy left a party on the island at 11:15 p.m. Friday , with Kopechne . He maintained his intent was to immediately take Kopechne to a ferry landing and return to Edgartown , but that he made a wrong turn onto a dirt road leading to a one-lane bridge . After his car skidded off the bridge into Poucha Pond , Kennedy swam free . He maintained he tried to rescue Kopechne from the submerged car , but could not . Her death could have happened any time between about 11:30 p.m. Friday and 1 a.m. Saturday , as an off-duty deputy sheriff maintained he saw a car matching Kennedy 's at 12:40 a.m. Kennedy left the scene and did not report the accident to police until after 10 a.m. Saturday . A diver recovered Kopechne 's body from the car shortly before 9 a.m. Saturday . At a July 25 , 1969 court hearing , Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended jail sentence . In a televised statement that same evening , he said his conduct immediately after the accident made no sense to me at all , and that he regarded his failure to report the accident immediately as indefensible . A January 5 , 1970 judicial inquest concluded Kennedy and Kopechne did not intend to take the ferry , and that Kennedy intentionally turned toward the bridge , operating his vehicle negligently , if not recklessly , at too high a rate of speed for the hazard which the bridge posed in the dark . The judge stopped short of recommending charges , and a grand jury convened on April 6 , 1970 , returning no indictments",
