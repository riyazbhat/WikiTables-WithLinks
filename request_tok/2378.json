  "/wiki/Running": "Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot . Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground ( though there are exceptions ) . This is in contrast to walking , where one foot is always in contact with the ground , the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion . A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously , with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity . The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting . Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy . It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago , probably in order to hunt animals . Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas . Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE , while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE . Running has been described as the world 's most accessible sport .",

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

Today , it is a sporting event that involves horses and other livestock , designed to test the skill and speed of the cowboys and cowgirls . American style professional rodeos generally comprise the following events : tie-down roping , team roping , steer wrestling , saddle bronc riding , bareback bronc riding , bull riding and barrel racing . The events are divided into two basic categories : the rough stock events and the timed events . Depending on sanctioning organization and region , other events such as breakaway roping , goat tying , and pole bending may also be a part of some rodeos . American rodeo , particularly popular today within the Canadian province of Alberta and throughout the western United States , is the official state sport of Wyoming , South Dakota , and Texas . The iconic silhouette image of a Bucking Horse and Rider is a federal and state-registered trademark of the State of Wyoming . The Legislative Assembly of Alberta has considered making American rodeo the official sport of that province . However , enabling legislation has yet to be passed .

  "/wiki/Golf": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible . Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 . Golf 's first major , and the world 's oldest tournament in existence , is The Open Championship , also known as the British Open , which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire , Scotland .

It is the last remaining ATP World Tour-level tournament in the United States to be played on clay courts . The tournament began in 1910 when the Western Lawn Tennis Association ( a section of the United States Lawn Tennis Association now known as the USTA/Midwest ) lobbied the USLTA that a National Clay Court Championship would help promote the establishment of more clay courts in the West . Clay courts were more economical to install and maintain than grass courts , and the hope was that the lower costs associated with court construction would allow for a more rapid expansion of the game . The first National Clay Court Championships were held at the Omaha Field Club with a crowd of 5,000 watching the finals . Participation and play on clay grew as a result of the event and others , and in 1914 the event was moved to the Cincinnati Tennis Club .

The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages .

During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s .

A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three .

The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

However , he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson , then-owner of the Aeros , who also wanted control of a new arena . The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997 , but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum . It was not until the city and the Rockets signed an amended agreement in 2001 , excluding the Aeros , that the proposal was accepted . Construction began in July 2001 , and the new arena was officially opened in October 2003 . The total costs were $ 235 million , with the city of Houston paying the majority , and the Rockets paying for enhancements . Toyota paid US $ 100 million for the naming rights ."
