  "/wiki/Turrets": "In architecture , a turret ( from Italian : torretta , little tower ; Latin : turris , tower ) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle . Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification . As their military use faded , turrets were used for decorative purposes , as in the Scottish baronial style . A turret can have a circular top with crenelations as seen in the picture at right , a pointed roof , or other kind of apex . It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building ; however , a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building ; in this case , it is typically part of a room , that can be simply walked into - see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets , which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper . A building may have both towers and turrets ; turrets might be smaller or higher but turrets instead project from the edge of a building rather than continue to the ground . The size of a turret is therefore limited , since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building . Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel . In modern times , a gun turret is a weapon mount that houses the crew or mechanism of a projectile-firing weapon , allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired in some degree of azimuth and elevation . It can be found on warships , combat vehicles , military aircraft , and land fortifications , and usually offers some degree of armour or protection .",
  "/wiki/Battlements": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
