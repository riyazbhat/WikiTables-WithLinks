  "/wiki/Gaywood,_Norfolk": "Gaywood is a civil parish in Norfolk , England Since 1974 , the parish has formed part of the non-metropolitan district of King 's Lynn and West Norfolk . Previously it was part of the Borough of King 's Lynn , from 1935 and , before that , part of Freebridge Lynn Rural District . Gaywood Hall , the seat of the Bagge family , baronets in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , was built on the site of a mediaeval palace of a Bishop of Norwich , John de Gray . The Gaywood Hall later became part of King 's Lynn Technical College . The church of St Faith is in the Early English style , restored by Walter Caroe in the 1920s ; the church is now shared by a partnership of Anglican and Methodist congregations . According to William White 's History , Gazetteer and Directory of Norfolk ( 1883 ) , Gaywood was in the late 19th century a considerable village with a population of 805 . The population expanded significantly in the 1960s after King 's Lynn became an overflow town for London in 1962 and housing estates were built here and nearby in North and South Wootton . Gaywood is now a suburb of King 's Lynn . There are several schools in the Gaywood area ; these include Gaywood Community Primary School , St Martha 's Catholic Primary School , Howard Infant and Junior Schools , King Edward VII School and King 's Lynn Academy ( formerly Gaywood Park High School ) . The Gaywood area has a wide variety of local shops , including a Tesco supermarket , Aldi , a launderette , several cafes and various takeaways . The Gaywood Church Rooms are used as a meeting place for many different groups , including Gaywood Babies and Toddlers Group . It also used to be the home of the Gaywood Methodist Playgroup ( established in 1968 ) , but this closed for the final time in July 2016 , due to a lack of children attending and ever increasing costs .",
  "/wiki/Groin_vault": "A groin vault or groined vault ( also sometimes known as a double barrel vault or cross vault ) is produced by the intersection at right angles of two barrel vaults . The word groin refers to the edge between the intersecting vaults . Sometimes the arches of groin vaults are pointed instead of round . In comparison with a barrel vault , a groin vault provides good economies of material and labour . The thrust is concentrated along the groins or arrises ( the four diagonal edges formed along the points where the barrel vaults intersect ) , so the vault need only be abutted at its four corners . Groin vault construction was first exploited by the Romans , but then fell into relative obscurity in Europe until the resurgence of quality stone building brought about by Carolingian and Romanesque architecture . It was superseded by the more flexible rib vaults of Gothic architecture in the later Middle Ages . Difficult to construct neatly because of the geometry of the cross groins ( usually elliptical in cross section ) , the groin vault required great skill in cutting stone to form a neat arris . This difficulty , in addition to the formwork required to create such constructions , led to the rib vault superseding the groin vault as the preferred solution for enclosing space in Gothic architecture . The construction method was particularly common on the basement level , such as at Myres Castle in Scotland , or at the ground floor level for the storerooms as at Muchalls Castle in Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Manchester": "Manchester ( /\u02c8m\u00e6nt\u0283\u025bst\u0259r/ ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester , England , with a population of 547,627 as of 2018 ( 5th most populous English district ) . It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",
  "/wiki/Colonnade": "In classical architecture , a colonnade is a long sequence of columns joined by their entablature , often free-standing , or part of a building . Paired or multiple pairs of columns are normally employed in a colonnade which can be straight or curved . The space enclosed may be covered or open . In St. Peter 's Square in Rome , Bernini 's great colonnade encloses a vast open elliptical space . When in front of a building , screening the door ( Latin porta ) , it is called a portico , when enclosing an open court , a peristyle . A portico may be more than one rank of columns deep , as at the Pantheon in Rome or the stoae of Ancient Greece . When the intercolumniation is alternately wide and narrow , a colonnade may be termed araeosystyle ( Gr . \u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 , widely spaced , and \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 , with columns set close together ) , as in the case of the western porch of St Paul 's Cathedral and the east front of the Louvre .",

  "/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)": "The West Midlands County is a metropolitan county and combined authority area in western-central England with a 2018 estimated population of 2,916,458 , making it the second most populous county in England after Greater London . It came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972 , formed from parts of Staffordshire , Worcestershire and Warwickshire . The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Between 1974 and 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was the administrative body covering the county ; this was abolished on 31 March 1986 , and the constituent metropolitan boroughs effectively became unitary authorities . A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands . The county is sometimes described as the West Midlands metropolitan area or the West Midlands conurbation or Greater Birmingham , although these have different , and less clearly defined , boundaries . The main conurbation , or urban area , does not include Coventry for example . The name West Midlands is also used for the much larger West Midlands region , which sometimes causes confusion , not surprising perhaps when geographically it is on the eastern side of the region , the western side comprising Shropshire and Herefordshire the southern side comprising Worcestershire and most of Warwickshire .",

The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

Historically in Lancashire , it is on the north bank of the River Tame , in the foothills of the Pennines , 6.2 miles ( 10.0 km ) east of Manchester . Evidence of Stone Age , Bronze Age , and Viking activity has been discovered in Ashton-under-Lyne . The Ashton part of the town 's name probably dates from the Anglo-Saxon period , and derives from Old English meaning settlement by ash trees . The origin of the under-Lyne suffix is less clear ; it possibly derives from the British lemo meaning elm or from Ashton 's proximity to the Pennines . In the Middle Ages , Ashton-under-Lyne was a parish and township and Ashton Old Hall was held by the de Asshetons , lords of the manor . Granted a Royal Charter in 1414 , the manor spanned a rural area consisting of marshland , moorland , and a number of villages and hamlets . Until the introduction of the cotton trade in 1769 , Ashton was considered bare , wet , and almost worthless . The factory system , and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution triggered a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area , and by the mid-19th century Ashton had emerged as an important mill town at a convergence of newly constructed canals and railways . Ashton-under-Lyne 's transport network allowed for an economic boom in cotton spinning , weaving , and coal mining , which led to the granting of municipal borough status in 1847 . In the mid-20th century , imports of cheaper foreign goods led to the decline of Ashton 's heavy industries but the town has continued to thrive as a centre of commerce and Ashton Market is one of the largest outdoor markets in the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

From being a market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century , Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century . It now lies within the West Yorkshire Urban Area , the United Kingdom 's fourth-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.6 million . Today , Leeds has become the largest legal and financial centre outside London with the financial and insurance services industry worth \u00a313 billion to the city 's economy .

  "/wiki/West_Yorkshire": "West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England . It is an inland and , in relative terms , upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in the moors of the Pennines . West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972 and has a population of 2.2 million . West Yorkshire consists of five metropolitan boroughs ( City of Bradford , Calderdale , Kirklees , City of Leeds and City of Wakefield ) and is bordered by the counties of Derbyshire to the south , Greater Manchester to the south-west , Lancashire to the north-west , North Yorkshire to the north and east , and South Yorkshire to the south and south-east . Remnants of strong coal , wool and iron ore industries remain in the county , having attracted people over the centuries , and this can be seen in the buildings and architecture . Major railways and two major motorways traverse the county , which also contains Leeds Bradford International Airport . West Yorkshire County Council was abolished in 1986 , so its five districts became effectively unitary authorities . However , the metropolitan county , which covers an area of 2,029 square kilometres ( 783 sq mi ) , continues to exist in law , and as a geographic frame of reference . Since 1 April 2014 West Yorkshire has been a combined authority area , with the local authorities pooling together some functions over transport and regeneration as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority . West Yorkshire includes the West Yorkshire Urban Area , which is the biggest and most built-up urban area within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire .",
  "/wiki/Salford,_Greater_Manchester": "Salford ( /\u02c8s\u0252lf\u0259rd/ ) is a district and the main component in the City of Salford , Greater Manchester , England , directly west of Manchester city centre in a meander of the River Irwell , which forms part of its boundary with Manchester . The wider City of Salford local government district is administered from Swinton . The former County Borough of Salford , which included Broughton , Pendleton and Kersal , was granted city status in 1926 . In 2011 , Salford had a population of 103,886 , and the City of Salford 233,933 . Historically in Lancashire , Salford was the judicial seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire . It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , in about 1230 , making Salford a free borough of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester , although since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed . Salford became a major cotton and silk spinning and weaving factory town and inland port on the Manchester Ship Canal in the 18th and 19th centuries . Industries declined in the 20th century , causing economic depression , and Salford became a place of contrasts , with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next to some of the most socially deprived and violent areas in England . Salford is home to the University of Salford , and has seen several firsts , including the world 's first free public library , and the first street to be lit by gas . Salford 's MediaCityUK became the headquarters of CBBC and BBC Sport in 2011 , joined by ITV Granada in 2013 .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Church_of_St_George,_Chester_Road,_Hulme": "The Church of St George , Chester Road , Hulme , Manchester , is an early Gothic Revival church by Francis Goodwin , built in 1826-8 . It was restored in 1884 by J. S. Crowther . It was designated a Grade II* listed building on 3 October 1974 . The church was a Commissioners ' church , ( built to celebrate the victory at the Battle of Waterloo ) who allotted the sum of \u00a315,000 for construction . Goodwin was an obvious choice for architect having already undertaken a number of churches in the Midlands and the North West , as well as the original Manchester Town Hall . Sir Nikolaus Pevsner considers that Goodwin 's inspiration was Nicholas Hawksmoor 's St Michael , Cornhill and that the whole makes a lively and memorable picture . A six-bay nave with high three-light Perpendicular windows concludes with a tall tower at the west end , and two high pinnacles at the east . Porches are set at the northwest and southwest corners . Drawing from Pevsner , the English Heritage inspectors who listed the building in 1974 , without an internal inspection , stated that the interior was reported as having : galleries ; Perpendicular arcades ; [ and a ] wall monument to The Hon . George Berkeley Molyneux ( d.1841 ) , by Edward Physick , in form of soldier mourning beside urn . A declining inner-city population in the post-war period , combined with the increasing isolation of the church caused by major road construction in its vicinity , led to St George 's closure in 1984 . The last Rector Revd Derek Seber worked with Brian Redhead to try to find a long term use for the building including as a museum for Rolls Royce and as a Museum of Sport .",

  "/wiki/Oldham": "Oldham /\u02c8o\u028ald\u0259m/ is a town in Greater Manchester , England , amid the Pennines and between the rivers Irk and Medlock , 5.3 miles ( 8.5 km ) southeast of Rochdale and 6.9 miles ( 11.1 km ) northeast of Manchester . It is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , which had a population of 230,800 in 2015 . Historically in Lancashire , and with little early history to speak of , Oldham rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and among the first ever industrialised towns , rapidly becoming one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England . At its zenith , it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world , producing more cotton than France and Germany combined . Oldham 's textile industry fell into decline in the mid-20th century ; the town 's last mill closed in 1998 . The demise of textile processing in Oldham depressed and heavily affected the local economy . Today Oldham is a predominantly residential town , and the improvement of the town centre is the focus of a project for transforming Oldham into a centre for further education and the performing arts . It is , however , still distinguished architecturally by the surviving cotton mills and other buildings associated with that industry . As of 2001 , the town had a population of 103,544 and an area of around 26 square miles ( 67 km2 ) ."
