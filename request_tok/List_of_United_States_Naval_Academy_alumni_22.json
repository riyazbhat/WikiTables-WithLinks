  "/wiki/Puerto_Rico": "Puerto Rico [ a ] ( Spanish for Rich Port ; abbreviated PR ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . Free Associated State of Puerto Rico ) [ b ] and briefly called Porto Rico , [ c ] is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea , approximately 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) southeast of Miami , Florida . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory 's total population is approximately 3.4 million , more than 21 U.S. states . Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements . On September 23 , 1868 , Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule , declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people , with right to sovereignty .",

Such ships , with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as treaty cruisers . Originally classified a light cruiser when she was authorized , because of her thin armor , Vincennes was reclassified a heavy cruiser , because of her 8-inch guns . The term heavy cruiser was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930 . This ship and Quincy were a slightly improved version of the New Orleans-class design .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Savo_Island": "The Battle of Savo Island , also known as the First Battle of Savo Island and , in Japanese sources , as the First Battle of the Solomon Sea ( \u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u6d77\u6226 , Dai-ichi-ji Soromon Kaisen ) , and colloquially among Allied Guadalcanal veterans as The Battle of the Five Sitting Ducks , was a naval battle of the Pacific Campaign of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval forces . The battle took place on August 8-9 , 1942 , and was the first major naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign , and the first of several naval battles in the straits later named Ironbottom Sound , near the island of Guadalcanal . The Imperial Japanese Navy , in response to Allied amphibious landings in the eastern Solomon Islands , mobilized a task force of seven cruisers and one destroyer under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa . The task forces sailed from Japanese bases in New Britain and New Ireland down New Georgia Sound ( also known as the Slot ) , with the intention of interrupting the Allied landings by attacking the supporting amphibious fleet and its screening force . The Allied screen consisted of eight cruisers and fifteen destroyers under British Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley VC , but only five cruisers and seven destroyers were involved in the battle . In a night action , Mikawa thoroughly surprised and routed the Allied force , sinking one Australian and three American cruisers , while suffering only light damage in return . The battle has often been cited as the worst defeat in the history of the United States Navy . After the initial engagement , Mikawa , fearing Allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak , decided to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to locate and destroy the Allied invasion transports . The Japanese attacks prompted the remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force to withdraw earlier than planned ( prior to the unloading of all supplies ) , temporarily ceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese . This early withdrawal of the fleet left the Allied ground forces ( primarily United States Marines ) , which had landed on Guadalcanal and nearby islands only two days before , in a precarious situation , with limited supplies , equipment , and food to hold their beachhead . Mikawa 's decision to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to destroy the Allied invasion transports was primarily founded on the high risk of Allied carrier strikes against his fleet upon daybreak . In reality , the Allied carrier fleet , similarly fearing Japanese attack , had already withdrawn beyond operational range .",
