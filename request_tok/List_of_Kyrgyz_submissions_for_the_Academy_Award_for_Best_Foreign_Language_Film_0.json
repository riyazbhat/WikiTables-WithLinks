Kyrgyz is a member of the Kyrgyz-Kipchak subgroup of the Kypchak languages and modern-day language convergence has resulted in an increasing degree of mutual intelligibility between Kazakh and Kyrgyz . Kyrgyz was originally written in the Turkic runes , gradually replaced by a Perso-Arabic alphabet ( in use until 1928 in USSR , still in use in China ) . Between 1928 and 1940 a Latin-script alphabet , the Uniform Turkic Alphabet , was used . In 1940 due to general Soviet policy , a Cyrillic alphabet eventually became common and has remained so to this day , though some Kyrgyz still use the Arabic alphabet . When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 , there was a popular idea among some Kyrgyzstanis to switch to the Latin script , which is still common in some small pockets of the countryside and make the Latin script the countrys official national script ( taking in mind a version closer to the Turkish alphabet rather than the original alphabet of 1928-40 ) . Although the plan has not yet been implemented , it remains in occasional discussion .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania .
