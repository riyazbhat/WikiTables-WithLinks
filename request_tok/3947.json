The season also marked the eighth and final season for the Flames in Atlanta before the franchise relocated to Calgary . The NHL would return to the Georgia capital in 1999 with the Thrashers , but that team would ultimately relocate away from Atlanta as well becoming the second ( and current ) incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets . The collapse of the WHA also saw the much hyped super-star rookie Wayne Gretzky come to the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers . Gretzky would tie Marcel Dionne for the scoring lead with 137 points and capture the Hart Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player while Dionne took home the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer by virtue of having scored two more goals . Gretzky aside , many players made their debut in the NHL this season , both due to the WHA merger and to a change in the rules for the Entry Draft allowing eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds to be drafted for the first time ; no fewer than seven Hall of Famers ( Gretzky , Ray Bourque , Mark Messier , Mike Gartner , Michel Goulet , Mark Howe , and an undrafted Joe Mullen ) debuted this season , along with numerous other perennial stars . The big story of the regular season was the record-breaking undefeated streak compiled by the Philadelphia Flyers . After starting the season with a 5-2 win over the New York Islanders and a 9-2 loss to the Atlanta Flames , the Flyers did not lose again for nearly three months , earning at least one point in every game between a 4-3 win over Toronto on October 14 , 1979 , and a 4-2 win over Buffalo on January 6 , 1980 , earning a 35 game record of 25-0-10 .",

The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the New York metropolitan area , along with the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers , and their fan base resides primarily on Long Island . The team was founded in 1972 as part of the NHL 's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league World Hockey Association ( WHA ) out of the newly built Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Uniondale , New York . After two years of building up the team 's roster , they found almost instant success by securing fourteen straight playoff berths starting with their third season . The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships between 1980 and 1983 , the seventh of eight dynasties recognized by the NHL in its history . Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports . They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships .

  "/wiki/2012_Stanley_Cup_Finals": "The 2012 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League 's ( NHL ) 2011-12 season , and the culmination of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs . The Western Conference playoff champion Los Angeles Kings defeated the Eastern Conference playoff champion New Jersey Devils four games to two , capturing the first Stanley Cup title in the team 's 45-year history , dealing the Devils just their second Stanley Cup Finals defeat in five tries and first since 2001 . Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs . The 2012 Final ended a long Stanley Cup Final appearance drought for the Los Angeles Kings , who had appeared in the Finals only once in franchise history , in 1993 , when the Kings lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games . The New Jersey Devils last appeared in 2003 , when they defeated the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games to win their third Stanley Cup title . It was the first championship series since 2007 whose Stanley Cup-clinching game was played on the winning team 's home ice . The Eastern Conference winner had home ice advantage for the first time since 2006 , since the Devils had a better regular season record than the Kings . The Devils were the lowest-seeded team to have home-ice advantage in the Stanley Cup Finals , a record previously held by the Devils when they won the Cup as a fourth seed in 2000 . With the Devils entering the playoffs as the ninth seed of the 16 playoff teams by regular season record ( no division titles ) and the Kings as the 13th , their combined seed of 22 was the second highest of any playoff matchup ( only trailing the 1991 Cup Finals with 23 ) , and it was the first playoff matchup with no team seeded better than 9th . The Kings became the first , as well as the last eighth-seeded team to win the Stanley Cup since the conference-based seedings were introduced in 1994 ."
