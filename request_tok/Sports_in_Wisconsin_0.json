The organization adopted the Snappers nickname in 1995 after using its parent team 's nickname for its first 13 seasons . The name derives from the snapping turtle , because Beloit was formerly known as Turtle Village , and there is still a Turtle Creek and a town of Turtle . All of these are named for a turtle-shaped Indian mound on the campus of Beloit College . After the Milwaukee Brewers withdrew their affiliation with Beloit due to the lack of a new stadium , efforts were started to build one similar to facilities used by the Rockford RiverHawks or the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers . One possible scenario involved construction on a site near Janesville , which could have included renaming the team to reflect a broader Rock County audience . However , no new stadium was built and improvements , including redoing the entire field and repairing the concrete concourse , have been made to the existing site in recent years . After the 2012 season , the city of Beloit appropriated $ 100,000 in order to completely redo the outfield",

The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play .

Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood , New Jersey . Although Ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements , it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating , even at the highest levels of competition . The term frisbee , often used to generically describe all flying discs , is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company , and thus the sport is not formally called Ultimate frisbee , though this name is still in common casual use . Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone . Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc , and interceptions , incomplete passes , and passes out of bounds are turnovers . Rain , wind , or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers , heightening the pressure of play . From its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s , ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement . Instead it relies on the sportsmanship of players and invokes Spirit of the Game to maintain fair play . Players call their own fouls , and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur . Playing without referees is the norm for league play but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of observers or game advisors to help in disputes , and the professional league employs empowered referees .

  "/wiki/Indoor_Soccer": "Indoor soccer or arena soccer ( known internationally as indoor football , minifootball , fast football , floorball or showball ) , is a game derived from association football adapted for play in a walled indoor arena . Indoor soccer , as it is most often known in the United States and Canada , was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months , when snow would make outdoor play difficult . In those countries , gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play . In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls , and is referred to by different names ( such as fast football ( futbol rapido ) in Mexico , showbol in South America , and indoor football ( futbol indoor ) in Spain ) . Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play , such as futsal and five-a-side football . Unlike futsal , which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces , indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf ( or , in the case of the British Masters Football variety , synthetic carpet ) . Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines , and there are no player throw-ins . FIFA , the international body that oversees international association football competitions , does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer , having developed its own code of indoor football ( which they refer to as futsal ) . Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States , Canada , and Mexico , with several amateur , collegiate and professional leagues functioning . While internationally less popular than futsal , indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America . The World Minifootball Federation ( WMF ) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level , having replaced the International Fast Football Federation ( FIFRA ) . The term minifootball , which was originally coined in Europe , has been adopted by the WMF as a standard international name for the sport",
