  "/wiki/Dominican_amber": "Dominican amber is amber from the Dominican Republic . Resin from the extinct tree Hymenaea protera is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics . Dominican amber differentiates itself from Baltic amber by being nearly always transparent , and it has a higher number of fossil inclusions . This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest .",
  "/wiki/Dominican_Republic": "The Dominican Republic ( /d\u0259\u02c8m\u026an\u026ak\u0259n/ d\u0259-MIN-ik-\u0259n ; Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Dominicana , pronounced [ re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0omini\u02c8kana ] ( listen ) ) is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region . It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island , which it shares with the Republic of Haiti , making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands , along with Saint Martin , that are shared by two sovereign states . The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area ( after Cuba ) at 48,671 square kilometers ( 18,792 sq mi ) , and third by population with approximately 10.5 million people ( 2020 est . ) , of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo , the capital city . The native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans , dividing it into five chiefdoms . The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822 .",

  "/wiki/Trophophoresy": "Trophobiosis is a symbiotic association between organisms where food is obtained or provided . The provider of food in the association is referred to as a trophobiont . The name is derived from the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae troph\u0113 , meaning nourishment and -\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 -biosis which is short for the English symbiosis . Among the more noted trophobiotic groups are ants and members of a number of hemipteran families . A number of ant genera are recorded as tending groups of hemipterans to varying degrees . In most cases the ants collect and transport the honeydew secretions from the hemipterans back to the nest for consumption . Not all examples of ant trophobiotic interactions are mutualistic , with instances such as ants attracted to Cacopsylla pyricola feeding on both the honeydew and the C. pyricola individuals . This interaction has been recorded in Ancient Chinese writings and is noted as one of the oldest instances of biological pest control . In mutualistic relationships , the production of honeydew by trophobionts is rewarded by removal of dead hemipterans and protection from a variety of predators by the attendant ants . In some relationships the ants will build shelters for the farmed trophobionts , either to protect them or keep them from leaving the area . Some species of ants construct underground rooms to house the trophobionts and carry them between the host plant and housing area daily . In more complex obligate relationships ( where both symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival ) the ants will nest with the partner trophobionts in silk constructed leaf shelters or in underground colonies .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

The Croats arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century . Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke Branimir .
