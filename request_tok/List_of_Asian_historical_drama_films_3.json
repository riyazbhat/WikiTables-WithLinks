She is portrayed as a malevolent fox spirit in legends as well as novels . Her identification as a fox spirit seems to have originated from at least the Tang dynasty . These accounts have been popularized in works such as the Wu Wang Fa Zhou Pinghua ( \u6b66\u738b\u4f10\u7d02\u5e73\u8a71 ) , the Fengshen Yanyi , and the Lieguo Zhi . She is considered a classic example of how a beautiful woman can cause the downfall of a dynasty in Chinese culture . In the Song dynasty , fox spirit cults , including those dedicated to Daji , became outlawed , but their suppression was unsuccessful . For example , in 1111 , an imperial edict was issued for the destruction of many spirit shrines within Kaifeng , including those of Daji .",

The philosophy of Confucius , also known as Confucianism , emphasized personal and governmental morality , correctness of social relationships , justice , kindness , and sincerity . His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin dynasty . Following the victory of Han over Chu after the collapse of Qin , Confucius 's thoughts received official sanction in the new government and were further developed into a system known in the West as Neo-Confucianism , and later New Confucianism ( Modern Neo-Confucianism ) . Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the Chinese classic texts including all of the Five Classics , but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself . Aphorisms concerning his teachings were compiled in the Analects , but only many years after his death . Confucius 's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief . He championed strong family loyalty , ancestor veneration , and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives , recommending family as a basis for ideal government . He espoused the well-known principle Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself , the Golden Rule . He is also a traditional deity in Daoism .

Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han Chinese ( Han Zu ) and the Chinese script is referred to as Han characters . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9-23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC - 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25-220 AD ) . The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( r. 141-87 BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu .

It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history , starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280 . The story - part historical , part legend , and part mythical - romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers , who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it . While the novel follows hundreds of characters , the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty , and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei , Shu Han , and Eastern Wu . The novel deals with the plots , personal and military battles , intrigues , and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years . Romance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature ; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters ( mostly historical ) in 120 chapters . The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia , and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature . It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China .",

The kingdoms founded by ethnic Xiongnu , Xianbei , Di , Jie , Qiang , as well as Chinese and other ethnicities , took on Chinese dynastic names , and fought against each other and the Eastern Jin dynasty , which succeeded the Western Jin and ruled southern China . The period ended with the unification of northern China in the early 5th century by the Northern Wei , a dynasty established by the Xianbei Tuoba clan , and the history of ancient China entered the Northern and Southern dynasties period . The term Sixteen Kingdoms was first used by the 6th-century historian Cui Hong in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms and refers to the five Liangs ( Former , Later , Northern , Southern and Western ) , four Yans ( Former , Later , Northern , and Southern ) , three Qins ( Former , Later and Western ) , two Zhaos ( Former and Later ) , Cheng Han and Xia . Cui Hong did not count several other kingdoms that appeared at the time including the Ran Wei , Zhai Wei , Chouchi , Duan Qi , Qiao Shu , Huan Chu , Tuyuhun and Western Yan . Nor did he include the Northern Wei and its predecessor Dai , because the Northern Wei is considered to be the first of the Northern Dynasties in the period that followed the Sixteen Kingdoms . Classical Chinese historians called the period the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Barbarians ( simplified Chinese : \u4e94\u80e1\u5341\u516d\u56fd ; traditional Chinese : \u4e94\u80e1\u5341\u516d\u570b ; pinyin : W\u01d4h\u00fa Sh\u00edli\u00f9 Gu\u00f3 ) because of the active roles played by non-Chinese ethnicities during this period . Among the handful of the states founded by Chinese ( Former Liang , Western Liang , Ran Wei and Northern Yan ) , several founders had close relations with ethnic minorities . The father of Ran Min , the founder of the Ran Wei , was adopted into a Jie ruling family . Feng Ba , who is considered by some historians to be the founder of the Northern Yan , had been assimilated into Xianbei culture . Gao Yun , considered by other historians to be the Northern Yan founder , was a member of the Goguryeo royal family who had been adopted by Xianbei nobility . Due to fierce competition among the states and internal political instability , the kingdoms of this era were mostly short-lived .",
