  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",

It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",
  "/wiki/Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90 % market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25 % that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

It was released as Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market on November 15 , 2001 , in North America , followed by Australia , Europe and Japan in 2002 . It is classified as a sixth generation console , competing with Sony 's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 's GameCube . It was also the first major console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996 . Announced in 2000 , the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals , featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor , a processor that could be found on a standard PC . It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures .

This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software .

In 1984 , Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the Classic Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software . The system , rebranded Mac OS in 1996 , was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s . Noted for its ease of use , it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors . The current Mac operating system is macOS , originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016 . Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple 's purchase of NeXT , Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP , a Unix system , that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced . The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually . It is the basis of Apple 's current system software for its other devices - iOS , iPadOS , watchOS , and tvOS . Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X , Apple experimented with several other concepts , releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa , A/UX , MAE , and MkLinux . Apple 's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects , code named Star Trek , Taligent , and Copland . Although they have different architectures , the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI principles , including a menu bar across the top of the screen ; the Finder shell , featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can ; and overlapping windows for multitasking .",

It was released in 2000 as the sixth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series and was the second to use 3D graphics , following 1998 's The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time . Designed by a creative team led by Eiji Aonuma , Yoshiaki Koizumi , and Shigeru Miyamoto , Majora 's Mask was completed in less than two years . It featured enhanced graphics and several gameplay changes from its predecessor , though it reused a number of elements and character models , which the game 's creators called a creative decision made necessary by time constraints . Majora 's Mask is set in Termina , an alternate reality to Ocarina of Time 's Hyrule , which is to be destroyed along with its inhabitants in three days by a giant falling moon unless the player , as Link , can save it from imminent doom . The plot 's antagonist is a mischievous imp called the Skull Kid who has stolen a powerful , ancient artifact called Majora 's Mask from an enigmatic traveling mask salesman . The game introduced several novel concepts , revolving around the perpetually repeating three-day cycle and the use of various masks that can transform Link into different beings . As the player progresses through the game , Link also learns to play numerous melodies on his ocarina , which allow him to control the flow of time or open passages to four temple dungeons . Characteristic of the Zelda series , completion of the game involves successfully traversing through several dungeons , each of which contain a number of complex puzzles and enemies . On the Nintendo 64 , Majora 's Mask required the Expansion Pak , unlike Ocarina of Time , which provided additional memory for more refined graphics and greater flexibility in generating on-screen characters . Majora 's Mask earned widespread acclaim from critics , who praised the graphics and complex story , and has since been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time . It has also been recognized for its dark themes and undertones , tribal-inspired artstyle , and level design .",

The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable , which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller . The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television ; however , there are differences in the two GameCube models . The models produced before May 2004 also have the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port . The nameplate on the top of the console with the words Nintendo GameCube can be removed . This model is known as DOL-001 . The previously mentioned features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007 ; the later model was known as DOL-101 .

He appears in several incarnations over the course of the games , and also features in other Nintendo media , including merchandising comic books and animated series . He is one of Nintendo 's main icons and one of the most well-known and popular characters in video game history . Through The Legend of Zelda series , Link is depicted as a child , teenager , or young adult of the Hylian race , originating from the fictional land of Hyrule . Link often travels through Hyrule , defeating creatures , evil forces , and the series ' primary antagonist ( Ganon ) , while attempting to save Princess Zelda and Hyrule . To defeat Ganon , Link usually requires the mystical Master Sword and Light Arrows , or a similar legendary weapon , obtained after many trials and battles . In the course of his journey , he typically acquires various other magical objects or items , including musical instruments and weaponry . Within the lore of the franchise , Link is the soul of a legendary hero that , throughout history , is reincarnated within a seemingly ordinary boy or man when the need arises for a new reincarnation to defeat forces of evil . No definitive blood-connection has to exist between the different incarnations ; however , in The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword , the Link within that game becomes the ancestor of all Hyrulians , and he also seems to originate the hero 's green garb . In the Skyward Sword prequel manga published in Hyrule Historia , an older incarnation of the hero who aids the goddess Hylia is shown ; however , the hero is not definitively identified as Link . Link has made cameo appearances in a few Mario games . He is a playable character via DLC in the newest installment to the Mario Kart series of games , Mario Kart 8 .",

Games for the iQue Player are stored on a 64 MB flash card which is contained within a cartridge that plugs directly into the controller/console . Games were purchased at a special iQue depot , where games could be downloaded onto the cartridge and played later , in a similar manner to the Famicom Disk System , Satellaview , Nintendo 64DD and Nintendo DS Download Play .

It involves an amnesic hero traveling through time in an attempt to rescue the princess Scheherazade from the evil wizard Sabaron , who has summoned a horde of demons to bring chaos to the once peaceful land of Arabia . The Magic of Scheherazade is divided into chapters and incorporates elements of both action-adventure and RPG gameplay styles . In each chapter , the player character can freely explore an overworld in a top-down perspective , visit towns and dungeons , interact with non-player characters ( NPCs ) , purchase items and equipment , and initiate quests . Objectives in each chapter include locating hidden time travel passages , recruiting new party members , learning new magic spells and defeating a boss . The player can engage hostile enemies with various weapons and spells using two different combat systems , one for real-time solo action on the overhead map and the other for random , turn-based battles fought alongside befriended allies . Defeating enemies in either instance earns the player experience points for improving character attributes . Once the commercial viability of the NES was proven in North America by the late 1980s , Japanese developer Culture Brain opened a company branch in the United States and chose to publish an English-language version of The Magic of Scheherazade after making several changes to the graphics and musical score . It has received mostly average review scores but generally positive commentary from critics for its visuals , gameplay , and difficulty balance . The game has been noted for its fusion of the adventure and RPG genres with journalists comparing its gameplay mechanics to both The Legend of Zelda and the Dragon Quest series .",
