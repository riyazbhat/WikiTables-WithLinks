  "/wiki/In_Living_Color": "In Living Color is an American sketch comedy television series that originally ran on Fox from April 15 , 1990 to May 19 , 1994 . Keenen Ivory Wayans created , wrote and starred in the program . The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood , California . The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented in living color during the 1960s , prior to mainstream color television . It also refers to the fact that most of the show 's cast was black , unlike other sketch comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live , whose casts are mostly white . It was controversial due to the Wayans ' decision to portray black humor from the ghetto in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as The Cosby Show , causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans . Other members of the Wayans family - Damon , Kim , Shawn , and Marlon - had regular roles , while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra . The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors , including Jamie Foxx , Jim Carrey , Tommy Davidson , David Alan Grier , and T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h . The show introduced Jennifer Lopez and Carrie Ann Inaba as members of In Living Color 's dance troupe The Fly Girls , with actress Rosie Perez serving as choreographer . The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons , capturing more than a 10-point Nielsen rating ; in the third and fourth seasons , ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights . The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety , Music or Comedy Series in 1990 . The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live , special episode as a counterprogram for the halftime show of U.S. leader CBS 's live telecast of Super Bowl XXVI , prompting the National Football League to book A-list acts for future game entertainment , starting with Michael Jackson the following year .",

  "/wiki/Television_pilot": "A television pilot ( also known as a pilot or a pilot episode and sometimes marketed as a tele-movie ) is a standalone episode of a television series that is used to sell the show to a television network . At the time of its creation , the pilot is meant to be the testing ground to gauge whether a series will be successful . It is , therefore , a test episode for the intended television series , an early step in the series development , much like pilot studies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity . In the case of a successful television series , the pilot is commonly the very first episode that is aired of the particular series under its own name ; the episode that gets the series off the ground . A backdoor pilot is an episode of an existing successful series , featuring future tie-in characters of an up-and-coming television series or film . Its purpose is to introduce the characters to an audience before the creators decide on whether or not they intend to pursue a spin-off series with those characters . Television networks use pilots to determine whether an entertaining concept can be successfully realized and whether the expense of additional episodes is justified . A pilot is best thought of as a prototype of the show that is to follow , because elements often change from pilot to series . Variety estimates that only a little over a quarter of all pilots made for American television proceed to the series stage . Most pilots are never publicly screened if they fail to sell a series .",
