Much like Today and its fellow NBC program The Tonight Show , the Early Show title was analogous to that of CBS 's late-night talk show , the Late Show . Unlike CBS ' other attempts at a morning news program ( which emphasize hard news ) , The Early Show followed the format of its two other competitors , which have long used a lighter soft news , lifestyle and infotainment approach .

The Early Show ended its twelve-year run on January 6 , 2012 , replaced three days later on January 9 by the second version of CBS This Morning",
