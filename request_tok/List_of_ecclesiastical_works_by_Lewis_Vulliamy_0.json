The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .

A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands .

Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating",

  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy",

Rochester was for many years a favourite of Charles Dickens , who owned nearby Gads Hill Place , Higham , basing many of his novels on the area . The Diocese of Rochester , the second oldest in England , is centred on Rochester Cathedral and was responsible for the founding of a school , now The King 's School in 604 AD , which is recognised as being the second oldest continuously running school in the world . Rochester Castle , built by Bishop Gundulf of Rochester , has one of the best preserved keeps in either England or France , and during the First Barons ' War ( 1215-1217 ) in King John 's reign , baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop Stephen Langton and held it against the king , who then besieged it .

  "/wiki/Bethnal_Green": "Bethnal Green is an area in the East End of London which lies 3.3 miles ( 5.3 km ) northeast of Charing Cross . It is an electoral ward of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , though the wider area stretches across both Bethnal Green Ward and St Peter 's ward . Part of the area has been designated by the council as a conservation area which includes a number of important listed buildings . The area emerged from the hamlet which developed around the Green , much of which survives today as Bethnal Green Gardens , located on Canbridge Heath Road . The hamlet was part of the ancient parish of Stepney , but adopted its definition as a wider district when , following population increases caused by the expansion of London in the 18th century , it was split off from Stepney as the parish of Bethnal Green in 1743 . It became part of the metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889 . The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900 . In 1965 it was abolished and became a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets . The economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the City of London to market gardening , weaving and light industry , which has now all but disappeared . The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically altered by aerial bombardment in the Second World War and the subsequent social housing developments . In 1943 , 173 people were killed at a single incident at Bethnal Green Underground station . Bethnal Green has formed part of Greater London since 1965 and is connected to the London Underground and London Overground",
  "/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets": "The London Borough of Tower Hamlets is a London borough located in East London ; it covers much of the traditional East End . It was formed in 1965 from the merger of the former metropolitan boroughs of Stepney , Poplar and Bethnal Green . The new authority 's unusual name comes from an alternative title for the Tower Division ; the area of south-east Middlesex , focused on ( but not limited to ) the area of the modern borough , which owed military service to the Tower of London . The borough lies adjacent to the east side of the City of London and on the north bank of the River Thames . It includes much of the redeveloped Docklands region of London , including West India Docks and Canary Wharf . Many of the tallest buildings in London occupy the centre of the Isle of Dogs in the south of the borough . A part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is in Tower Hamlets .

Brick Lane 's restaurants , neighbouring street market and shops provide the largest range of Bengali cuisine , woodwork , carpets and clothes in Europe . A 2017 study by Trust for London and New Policy Institute found that Tower Hamlets has the highest rate of poverty , child poverty , unemployment , and pay inequality of any London borough . It also found that it has the lowest GCSE attainment gap though , meaning that the gap in performance between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils is lower than in any other London Borough",
