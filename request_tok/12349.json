  "/wiki/Greater_Pittsburgh": "The Greater Pittsburgh Region is a populous region in the United States which is named for its largest city and economic center , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . There are several official and unofficial boundary definitions which may be used to describe this region . In the most restrictive definition , the region encompasses Pittsburgh 's urban core county , Allegheny , and six nearby Pennsylvania counties . Garrett Nelson and Alasdair Rae 's recent analysis of American commuter flows , An Economic Geography of the United States : From Commutes to Megaregions , identified the Pittsburgh megaregion as a region encompassing the entirety or significant portions of 54 counties in Western Pennsylvania , Eastern Ohio , Northern West Virginia , and Western Maryland . By this definition , the informal regional boundaries are similar to historical interpretations where the region is defined as the central portion of the Allegheny Plateau to the west and north of the Allegheny Front and south of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania 's Northern Tier . The hills and river valleys along the Upper Ohio River and its many eastern tributaries , including the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers have historically been the major centers of population of the region .",
  "/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are an American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the National League ( NL ) Central division . Founded in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Allegheny , the franchise has won five World Series championships . The Pirates are also often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos ( derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ) . The team plays its home games at PNC Park , its home since 2001 . The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909-1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium , so named because of its location near the confluence of the Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio rivers , from 1970-2000 . The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was competitive from its early years , winning three NL titles from 1901 to 1903 , playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history , most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a series-winning walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run . They also won the 1971 World Series , led by the talent of Roberto Clemente , and the 1979 World Series under the slogan We Are Family , led by Pops Willie Stargell . After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s ( winning three straight NL East Division titles ) , the Pirates struggled mightily over the following 20 years , with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012 - the longest such streak in American professional sports history - before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94-68 , qualifying them for the NL Wild Card .

The Pirates won in seven games , becoming the fourth team in World Series history to come back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win the Series . This marked the second time in the 1970s the Pirates won a World Series Game 7 on the road against the Orioles , the previous time being in the 1971 World Series . The Pirates were famous for adopting Sister Sledge 's hit song We Are Family as their theme song during the 1979 season . Willie Stargell , pitcher Bruce Kison , and catcher Manny Sanguill\u00e9n were the only players left over from the Pirates team that defeated the Orioles in 1971 , and Orioles ' pitcher Jim Palmer , shortstop Mark Belanger , and manager Earl Weaver were the only remaining Orioles from the 1971 team . Grant Jackson pitched for the Orioles in the 1971 series and for the Pirates in the 1979 series . In this Series , it was the AL team 's turn to play by NL rules , meaning no designated hitter and the Orioles ' pitchers would have to bat . While this resulted in Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit and runs batted in in Game 4 , overall , it hurt the Orioles because Lee May , their designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense , was only able to bat three times in the whole series . Willie Stargell , who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player , hit .400 with a record seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson 's record of 25 total bases , set in 1977 . The 1979 Pirates were the last team to win Game 7 of a World Series on the road until the San Francisco Giants defeated the Royals in Kansas City to win Game 7 of the 2014 series . With the Steelers having already won Super Bowl XIII ( they would later repeat in Super Bowl XIV following the Pirates ' championship ) , Pittsburgh also became the third city to win both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same season or calendar year .",

  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition .",

The team was founded as an expansion franchise in 1969 , and has participated in four World Series , winning in 1985 and 2015 , and losing in 1980 and 2014 .

The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name . The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city , including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL , the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA , and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League . In 1968 , the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries . Sanford Porte , a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park , Kansas was named the winner for his Royals entry . His reason had nothing to do with royalty . Kansas Citys new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouris billion-dollar livestock income , Kansas Citys position as the nations leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant , Porte wrote . The team 's board voted 6-1 on the name , with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman , who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him . Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots , the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman .",
