  "/wiki/Bascule_bridge": "A bascule bridge ( sometimes referred to as a drawbridge or a lifting bridge ) is a moveable bridge with a counterweight that continuously balances a span , or leaf , throughout its upward swing to provide clearance for boat traffic . It may be single- or double-leafed . The name comes from the French term for balance scale , which employs the same principle . Bascule bridges are the most common type of movable span because they open quickly and require relatively little energy to operate , while providing the possibility for unlimited vertical clearance for marine traffic",

It runs 49 miles ( 79 km ) from Fife in the south to Everett in the north , passing through the cities of Federal Way , SeaTac , Seattle , Shoreline , and Lynnwood . The route primarily follows arterial streets but has several freeway segments , including the SR 99 Tunnel in Downtown Seattle . SR 99 was originally a section of U.S. Route 99 ( US 99 ) , which was once the state 's primary north-south highway . US 99 was created in 1926 and replaced earlier local roads that date back to the 1890s and state roads designated as early as 1913 . The highway was moved onto the Alaskan Way Viaduct in 1953 , replacing a congested stretch through Downtown Seattle , and other sections were built to expressway standards in the 1950s . US 99 was ultimately replaced by the Tacoma-Everett section of Interstate 5 ( I-5 ) , which opened in stages between 1965 and 1969 . The route was de-certified in 1969 and SR 99 was created to keep segments of the highway under state control . After decades of rampant crime on some sections of SR 99 , various city governments funded projects to beautify the highway and convert it into a boulevard . A section of the highway in Tukwila was transferred to city control in 2004 , creating a two-mile ( 3.2 km ) gap in the route between the interchanges of SR 518 and SR 599 . The Alaskan Way Viaduct was closed on January 11 , 2019 , and was replaced with a downtown bored tunnel that opened on February 4 , 2019 . The replacement project was spurred by the 2001 Nisqually earthquake , which damaged the viaduct and left it vulnerable to further damage , as well as city plans to revitalize the Seattle waterfront",
  "/wiki/Fremont_Bridge_(Seattle)": "The Fremont Bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge that spans the Fremont Cut in Seattle , Washington . The bridge , which connects Fremont Avenue North and 4th Avenue North , connects the neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Anne . The Fremont Bridge was opened on Friday June 15 , 1917 , at a cost of $ 410,000 . The first traffic over the bridge was to owl cars , the last run of the trolleys , and then after 5am the same day to all other traffic . The Lake Washington Ship Canal was dedicated on July 4 , 1917 , which has caused confusion about the opening date , for this bridge crosses the canal . The Fremont Bridge is the first of four city bascules to cross the canal , the others being Ballard Bridge ( 1917 ) , University Bridge ( 1919 ) , and Montlake Bridge ( 1925 ) . The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 , and is also a designated city landmark , ID # 110347 . In its early years , before the construction of the nearby Aurora Bridge in 1932 , the Fremont Bridge had the most vehicle traffic of any bascule bridge in the United States . In another respect , it remains among the busiest even today : due to its low vessel clearance of 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) , the Fremont Bridge opens an average of 35 times a day , which makes it the most frequently opened drawbridge in the United States and one of the busiest bascule bridges in the world . Federal law gives marine traffic the right-of-way over vehicular traffic ; however , the Fremont Bridge is closed to most water traffic during rush hours . The Fremont Bridge was originally painted a dull green . In 1972 , the Fremont Improvement Committee picked a new color , Fremont Orange , and residents approved the change",

  "/wiki/Truss_arch_bridge": "A truss arch bridge combines the elements of the truss bridge and the arch bridge . The actual resolution of forces will depend upon the design . If no horizontal thrusting forces are generated this becomes an arch-shaped truss , essentially a bent beam - see moon bridge for an example . If horizontal thrust is generated but the apex of the arch is a pin joint , this is termed a three-hinged arch . If no hinge exists at the apex , it will normally be a two-hinged arch . In the Iron Bridge shown below , the structure of each frame emulates the kind of structure that previously had been made of wood . Such a wood structure uses closely fitted beams pinned together , so the members within the frames are not free to move relative to one another , as they are in a pin-jointed truss structure that allows rotation at the pin joint . Such rigid structures ( which impose bending stresses upon the elements ) were further developed in the 20th century as the Vierendeel truss",

  "/wiki/Pontoon_bridge": "A pontoon bridge ( or ponton bridge ) , also known as a floating bridge , uses floats or shallow-draft boats to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel . The buoyancy of the supports limits the maximum load they can carry . Most pontoon bridges are temporary , used in wartime and civil emergencies . Permanent floating bridges are useful for sheltered water-crossings where it is not considered economically feasible to suspend a bridge from anchored piers . Such bridges can require a section that is elevated , or can be raised or removed , to allow waterborne traffic to pass . Pontoon bridges have been in use since ancient times and have been used to great advantage in many battles throughout history , among them the Battle of Garigliano , the Battle of Oudenarde , the crossing of the Rhine during World War II , and during the Iran-Iraq War Operation Dawn 8",

  "/wiki/Interstate_90_in_Washington": "Interstate 90 ( I-90 ) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway that runs from Seattle , Washington , to Boston , Massachusetts . It crosses Washington state from west to east , traveling 298 miles ( 480 km ) from Seattle across the Cascade Mountains and into Eastern Washington , reaching the Idaho state line east of Spokane . I-90 intersects several of the state 's other major highways , including I-5 in Seattle , I-82 and U.S. Route 97 ( US 97 ) near Ellensburg , and US 395 and US 2 in Spokane . I-90 is the only Interstate to cross the state from west to east , and the only one to connect the state 's two largest cities , Seattle and Spokane . It incorporates two of the longest floating bridges in the world , the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge , which cross Lake Washington from Seattle to Mercer Island . I-90 crosses the Cascades at Snoqualmie Pass , one of the busiest mountain pass highways in the United States , and uses a series of viaducts and structures to navigate the terrain . The freeway travels across various landscapes , including suburban bedroom communities in the Seattle metropolitan area , forests of the Cascade Range , and the high plains of the Columbia Plateau . The crossing at Snoqualmie Pass was established as a wagon road in 1867 and incorporated into a cross-state auto trail , known as the Sunset Highway , in the early 1910s . The Sunset Highway was incorporated into the national highway system in 1926 as part of US 10 , which I-90 replaced when it was designated in 1957 . The first segments of the freeway , located in Spokane and Spokane Valley , opened at around the same time and the state government completed upgrades of US 10 to Interstate standards for most of the route by the late 1970s . The section of I-90 between Seattle and I-405 in Bellevue was delayed for decades because of environmental concerns and lawsuits by local groups over the freeway 's potential impact on nearby neighborhoods . A compromise agreement was reached by the federal , state , and local governments in 1976 to build a second floating bridge across Lake Washington and include extensive parks above tunneled sections of I-90 , which were completed in the early 1990s",

Portage Bay was named in 1913 because of the portage across the Montlake Isthmus that used to be necessary to move logs from Union Bay to Lake Union before the construction of the Ship Canal . The bay is home to two yacht clubs , the Seattle and the Queen City , and many houseboats , as well as the Northwest Fisheries Science Center of the National Marine Fisheries Service and the University of Washington 's College of Ocean and Fishery Science",
  "/wiki/Interstate_5_in_Washington": "Interstate 5 ( I-5 ) is an Interstate Highway on the West Coast of the United States , serving as the region 's primary north-south route . It travels 277 miles ( 446 km ) across the state of Washington , running from the Oregon state border at Vancouver , through the Puget Sound region , and to the Canadian border at Blaine . Within the Seattle metropolitan area , the freeway connects the cities of Tacoma , Seattle , and Everett . I-5 is the only interstate to traverse the whole state from north to south and is Washington 's busiest highway , with an average of 274,000 vehicles traveling on it through Downtown Seattle on a typical day . The segment in Downtown Seattle is also among the widest freeways in the United States , at 13 lanes , and includes a set of express lanes that reverse direction depending on time of the day . Most of the freeway is four lanes in rural areas and six to eight lanes in suburban areas , utilizing a set of high-occupancy vehicle lanes in the latter . I-5 also has three related auxiliary Interstates in the state , I-205 , I-405 , and I-705 , as well as several designated business routes and state routes . The freeway follows several historic railroads and wagon trails developed during American settlement of western Washington in the mid-to-late 19th century . The state legislature incorporated local roads into the Pacific Highway in 1913 , connecting the state 's southern and northern borders between Vancouver and Blaine . The Pacific Highway was built and paved over the next decade , and became the northernmost segment of the national U.S. Route 99 ( US 99 ) in 1926 . The federal government endorsed the creation of a national expressway system in the 1940s , including several bypasses on US 99 that were built by the state in the early 1950s . The state 's planned toll superhighway in the Seattle area was shelved in favor of a federally-funded freeway under the new Interstate Highway System , under which I-5 was created in 1957",

Built in 1936 , the structure is both listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a designated city landmark . The bridge was designed by city engineer Clark Eldridge . It replaced a timber-truss span that had been erected in 1916 . The funds were provided by the federal Public Works Administration and by local gas-tax and highway funds . The rigid frame created by the concrete box cells made the structure 60 percent longer than any such bridge previously constructed . The graffiti artwork underneath the bridge has received praise in C-Monster 's art blog and from a critic with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer",
  "/wiki/Rigid-frame_bridge": "A Rigid-frame bridge is a bridge in which the superstructure and substructure are rigidly connected to act as a continuous unit . Typically , the structure is cast monolithically , making the structure continuous from deck to foundation . The connections between members are rigid connections which transfer bending moment , axial forces , and shear forces . A bridge design consisting of a rigid frame can provide significant structural benefits , but can also be difficult to design and/or construct",
  "/wiki/Schmitz_Park_(Seattle)": "Schmitz Park , also known as Schmitz Preserve Park , is a 53.1-acre ( 21.5 ha ) park around 15 blocks east of Alki Point in West Seattle , Washington . It features Schmitz Park Creek and one of the last stands of old-growth forest in the city . Ferdinand and Emma Schmitz donated 30 acres ( 12 ha ) of the park to the city in 1908 . They wanted their land to be used as a park . ( Ferdinand was a German immigrant who moved to Seattle in 1887 and was the city 's Parks Commissioner from 1908 to 1914 ) . Additions to the park were purchased in 1909 , 1930 , 1947 , and 1958 , making the park grow over 20 more acres ( 8 ha ) . In 1949 , a preservation policy was applied to Schmitz Park . It stated that only foot trails were allowed and all signs were to be removed from inside the park 's borders . This policy still remains today .

  "/wiki/Spokane_Street_Bridge": "The Spokane Street Bridge , also known as the West Seattle Low-Level Bridge , is a concrete double-leaf swing bridge in Seattle , Washington . It carries Southwest Spokane Street over the Duwamish River , connecting Harbor Island to West Seattle . It has two separate end-to-end swing-span sections , each 480 feet ( 150 m ) long . Its construction was finished in 1991 , replacing an earlier bridge destroyed by a collision . It is named after Spokane Street , which itself is named after Spokane , Washington , which is named after the Spokane people . Each 7,500-short-ton ( 6,800 t ) leaf of the bridge floats on a 100-inch ( 2.5 m ) steel barrel in hydraulic oil , situated in center piers at each side of the river . As the bridge intersects the river at an oblique angle , both leaves rotate only 45 degrees ( one-eighth turn ) to clear the shipping channel instead of the 90-degree turn of most swing spans . It is claimed to be the only bridge of its type in the world and it has received several awards for its innovation , including the Outstanding Engineering Achievement Award of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1992 . The bridge was featured in a 2007 episode of Really Big Things shown on the Discovery Channel",

SR 520 intersects several state highways , including Interstate 5 ( I-5 ) in Seattle , I-405 in Bellevue , and SR 202 in Redmond . The original floating bridge was opened in 1963 as a replacement for the cross-lake ferry system that had operated since the late 19th century . In 1964 , SR 520 was designated as a freeway connecting I-5 to I-405 . An extension to Redmond was proposed later in the decade . In the 1970s and 1980s , sections of the freeway between Bellevue and Redmond were opened to traffic , replacing the temporary designation of SR 920 . Since the 1990s , SR 520 has been expanded with high-occupancy vehicle lanes ( HOV lanes ) and new interchanges to serve the Overlake area . In 2016 , the original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge was replaced by a wider bridge , as part of a multibillion-dollar expansion program that is scheduled to be completed in the 2020s . The program also includes the construction of new bus infrastructure at Montlake and on the Eastside , as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path along most of the highway 's length",
