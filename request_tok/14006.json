  "/wiki/Erciyes": "Mount Erciyes ( Turkish : Erciyes Da\u011f\u0131 ) , also known as Argaeus , is a volcano in Turkey . It is a large stratovolcano that is surrounded by many monogenetic vents and lava domes , and one maar . The bulk of the volcano is formed by lava flows of andesitic and dacitic composition . At some time in the past , part of the summit collapsed towards the east . The volcano began to form in the Miocene . At first , a volcano farther east named Ko\u00e7 Da\u011f formed from lava flows . Then , again to the east , large explosive eruptions formed a caldera . During the Pleistocene , Mount Erciyes proper grew inside the caldera together with a group of lava domes . Lateral eruptions of Erciyes may have generated ash layers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean during the early Holocene . The last eruptions occurred during the early Holocene and may have deposited ash as far away as Palestine ; the occurrence of historical volcanism is uncertain . Future eruptions of Erciyes may endanger cities in the north of the mountain , in Turkey . The volcano was glaciated during the Pleistocene , and one regular glacier still exists today , but is receding .",
