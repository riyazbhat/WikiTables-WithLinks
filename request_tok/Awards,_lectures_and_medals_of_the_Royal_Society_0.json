  "/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Armourers_and_Brasiers": "The Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London . The Armourers ' Guild was established in 1322 ; it received a Royal Charter in 1453 . Other Companies , including the Armour Repairers , merged with the Armourers . In 1708 , brass workers joined the Company , which was renamed as the Armourers ' and Brasiers ' Company . The Company does support the metallurgy industry , but does not retain a close association with its original trade , as is the case with a majority of Livery Companies . It exists primarily as a charitable establishment . The Company is based at Armourers ' Hall , situated on the corner of Coleman Street and London Wall , and has occupied this same site since 1346 . The Hall was one of the very few to escape destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666 . In 1795 , the Hall was enlarged , but it was decided in 1839 to rebuild it completely . The lantern , or dome , of the Livery Hall was added in 1872 . On 29 December 1940 , during a major blitz on London , the surrounding area was devastated , but again the Hall survived . The Armourers ' and Brasiers ' Company ranks twenty-second in the order of precedence of Livery Companies .",
