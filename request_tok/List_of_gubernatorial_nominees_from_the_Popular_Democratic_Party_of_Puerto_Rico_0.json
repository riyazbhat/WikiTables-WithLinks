  "/wiki/Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico": "The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Constituci\u00f3n del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ) is the controlling government document of Puerto Rico . It is composed of nine articles detailing the structure of the government as well as the function of several of its institutions . The document also contains an extensive and specific bill of rights . Since Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States , two authorities may override the Puerto Rico Constitution : the U.S. Constitution due to the Supremacy Clause , and relevant federal legislation due to the Territorial Clause . It was ratified by Puerto Rico 's electorate in a referendum on March 3 , 1952 , and on July 25 , 1952 , Governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn proclaimed that the constitution was in effect . July 25 , which had been an official holiday in Puerto Rico commemorating the invasion of United States troops in Puerto Rico on July 25 , 1898 , is now known as Constitution Day . According to University of Puerto Rico Law Professor Antonio Fern\u00f3s L\u00f3pez-Cepero , Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn chose July 25 for the proclamation of the Constitution with the intention of replacing the 1898 commemoration with the commemoration of the adoption of the constitution . In an article published on July 25 , 2010 , the late Professor Fern\u00f3s L\u00f3pez-Cepero stated to El Nuevo Dia newspaper that he heard this information from his father , the late Dr. Antonio Fernos Isern , who was the president of the Constitutional Convention in 1952",

The post was created by Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico which merely establishes that the secretary serves as acting governor when the governor is unable to perform his duties - a post similar to that of a lieutenant governor in U.S. politics . In recent times , however , the post has evolved into one similar to that of a foreign minister . Today , the secretary is the officer in charge of Puerto Rico 's foreign relations , albeit under the consent of Congress or the U.S. Department of State due to Puerto Rico 's political status . Administratively , the post differs to other similar titles in U.S. politics . Namely , that in contrast to lieutenant governors , the secretary is not elected by the people . He is instead appointed by the governor with advice and consent from both the Senate and House of Representatives . In addition , the secretary does not have any role whatsoever in the state legislature , in contrast to lieutenant governors . Unlike secretaries of state in other U.S. jurisdictions , the secretary of state of Puerto Rico does not take part in the elections process . That responsibility falls into the State Commission on Elections . Yet , the post does have some similarities to other U.S. secretaries of state . For example , the secretary of state of Puerto Rico is also the chief clerk of the commonwealth and the primary custodian of important records",
