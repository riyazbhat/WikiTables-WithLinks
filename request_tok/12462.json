  "/wiki/Boeing_747": "The Boeing 747 is an American wide-body , long-range , commercial jet airliner and cargo aircraft . The first wide-body airplane produced , it was the first plane dubbed a Jumbo Jet . Its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft . Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . First flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . The 747 uses a double-deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . Boeing designed the 747 's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first-class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . Boeing expected supersonic airliners - the development of which was announced in the early 1960s - to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete , while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future . Though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold , production passed 1,000 in 1993 . By June 2019 , 1,554 aircraft had been built , with 20 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order . As of January 2017 [ update ] , 60 of the jets have been lost in accidents in which a total of 3,722 people died . The 747-400 , the most common variant in service , has a high-subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0.85-0.855 ( up to 570 mph or 920 km/h ) with an intercontinental range of 7,260 nautical miles ( 8,350 statute miles or 13,450 km ) .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_747-400": "The Boeing 747-400 is an American wide-body jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes . Derived from the earlier versions of the Boeing 747 , the 747-400 retains the four-engine wide-body layout of its predecessors , while incorporating numerous technological and structural changes to produce a more efficient airframe . Its most distinguishing features versus preceding 747 models are 6-foot ( 1.8 m ) winglets mounted on 6-foot ( 1.8 m ) wing tip extensions , which are found on all 747-400s except for Japanese domestic market versions . It is the best-selling model of the Boeing 747 family of jet airliners . The 747-400 is equipped with a two-crew glass cockpit , which dispenses with the need for a flight engineer , along with more fuel-efficient engines , an optional fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer , and revised fuselage/wing fairings . The aircraft also features an all-new interior with upgraded in-flight entertainment architecture . As on the 747-300 , passenger variants include a stretched upper deck as standard . The 747-400 can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical three-class layout , 524 passengers in a typical two-class layout , or a maximum capacity of 660 passengers in a high-density one-class configuration with the 747-400D variant , and can fly non-stop for up to 7,670 nautical miles ( 14,200 km ) with maximum payload , depending on model . Northwest Airlines first placed the 747-400 in commercial service on February 9 , 1989 . The 747-400 was produced in passenger ( -400 ) , freighter ( -400F ) , combi ( -400M ) , domestic ( -400D ) , extended range passenger ( -400ER ) and extended range freighter ( -400ERF ) versions . The last 747-400 , a -400ERF , was delivered in 2009 . The 747-400 is the second-most recent version of the 747 family , having been superseded by the improved Boeing 747-8 .",
  "/wiki/Airbus_A330": "The Airbus A330 is a wide-body airliner made by Airbus . In the mid-1970s , Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300 , its first airliner , and developed the A330 twinjet in parallel with the A340 quadjet . In June 1987 , Airbus launched both designs with their first orders . The A330-300 , the first variant , took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994 . The slightly shorter A330-200 variant followed in 1998 . In 2014 , Airbus launched the A330neo , re-engined with Trent 7000 turbofans , which entered service in November 2018 . The A330 has a similar airframe to early A340 , except for the number of engines : two instead of four , landing gear and weights . Both airliners have fly-by-wire controls , which was first introduced on the A320 , as well as a similar glass cockpit . The A330 was Airbus 's first airliner to offer a choice of three engines : the General Electric CF6 , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , or the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 . The A330-300 has a range of 11,750 km or 6,350 nmi with 277 passengers , while the shorter A330-200 can cover 13,450 km or 7,250 nmi with 247 passengers . Later variants include the A330-200F dedicated freighter , the A330 MRTT military tanker , and the ACJ330 corporate jet . The A330 MRTT was proposed as the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 for the US Air Force 's KC-X competition , but lost to the Boeing KC-46 in appeal after an initial win .",

  "/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10": "The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is an American three-engine wide-body jet airliner manufactured by McDonnell Douglas . It has two turbofan engines mounted on underwing pylons and a third engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer . The DC-10 was intended as a successor to the company 's DC-8 for medium- to long range flights , using a larger capacity wide-body layout with seating up to 380 and more powerful engines . Lockheed also saw this niche as an ideal place to reenter the commercial airliner market with their very similar L-1011 TriStar . Although the L-1011 was more technologically advanced , the DC-10 would go on to outsell the L-1011 by a significant margin due to the DC-10 's lower price and earlier entry into the market . The initial DC-10-10 model was a domestic design with a typical range on the order of 3,800 miles ( 6,100 km ) in a two-class layout . The -15 was a version with more powerful engines , for hotter or higher-altitude airports . The -30 and -40 models were the international versions with extended range of up to 6,220 miles ( 10,010 km ) and a third main landing gear leg to support the higher takeoff weights . An even longer-range version proposed for British Airways , the -50 , was not built . The KC-10 Extender air-to-air refueling tanker version , was based on the -30 model . Production of the DC-10 ended in 1989 , with 386 DC-10s delivered to airlines and 60 KC-10s to the U.S. Air Force . The DC-10 had a poor safety record in early operations , especially due to a design flaw in the cargo doors .",
