  "/wiki/Athletics_(sport)": "Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running , jumping , throwing , and walking . The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field , road running , cross country running , and race walking . The results of racing events are decided by finishing position ( or time , where measured ) , while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts . The simplicity of the competitions , and the lack of a need for expensive equipment , makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world . Athletics is mostly an individual sport , with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes ' performances for a team score , such as cross country . Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC . The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century , and were then spread to other parts of the world . Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics , the global governing body for the sport of athletics , or its member continental and national federations . The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics . The foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships , which incorporates track and field , marathon running and race walking .

This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system .

Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles , including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling , easier parking , increased maneuverability , and access to roads , bike paths and rural trails . Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels , less air or noise pollution , and much reduced traffic congestion . These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large ( negligible damage to roads , less road area required ) . By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses , transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve . In addition , cycling provides a variety of health benefits .

  "/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting": "Olympic weightlifting , or Olympic-style weightlifting , often simply referred to as weightlifting , is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates . The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk . The snatch is a wide-grip , one-move lift . The clean and jerk is a close-grip , two-move lift . Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category . Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors . A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an incomplete entry for the competition . The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form . In comparison with other strength sports , which test limit strength ( with or without lifting aids ) , weightlifting tests aspects of human ballistic limits ( explosive strength ) ; the lifts are therefore executed faster - and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution - than other strength movements . The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting , and in particular their component lifts ( e.g . squats , deadlifts , cleans ) , are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength"
