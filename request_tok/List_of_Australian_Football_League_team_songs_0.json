It is also used as the club theme song by the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Rules Football league under the title Sons of the S'cray , as Western Bulldogs ' old name was Footscray , a suburb in Western Melbourne . When they renamed their team to Western Bulldogs , they changed it to Sons of the West , also changing some of the words to fit in with the new song and club name . There is a very strong similarity to a 1914 Navy song called sons of the sea sung by Robert Howe . It has also been known to be sung at Gloucestershire cricket games by a select number of supporters . The words are , Sons of the seas , when were bobbin ' up and down like this . Over the ocean , when were bobbin ' up and down like this . You can build a ship , my friend , when were bobbin ' up and down like this . But you ca n't beat the boys of the Gloucestershire , when were bobbin ' up and down like this . There is also an art-song called Sons of the Sea , lyrics by Sarojini Naidu , music by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor ( 1910 ) of which there is a famous recording by Peter Dawson ."
