  "/wiki/Georg_Philipp_Telemann": "Georg Philipp Telemann ( 24 March [ O.S . 14 March ] 1681 - 25 June 1767 ) ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8te\u02d0l\u0259man ] ) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist . Almost completely self-taught in music , he became a composer against his family 's wishes . After studying in Magdeburg , Zellerfeld , and Hildesheim , Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law , but eventually settled on a career in music . He held important positions in Leipzig , Sorau , Eisenach , and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721 , where he became musical director of that city 's five main churches . While Telemann 's career prospered , his personal life was always troubled : his first wife died only a few months after their marriage , and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving him . Telemann is one of the most prolific composers in history ( at least in terms of surviving oeuvre ) and was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the leading German composers of the time - he was compared favorably both to his friend Johann Sebastian Bach , who made Telemann the godfather and namesake of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel , and to George Frideric Handel , whom Telemann also knew personally . As part of his duties , he wrote a considerable amount of music for educating organists under his direction . This includes 48 chorale preludes and 20 small fugues ( modal fugues ) to accompany his chorale harmonizations for 500 hymns . His music incorporates French , Italian , and German national styles , and he was at times even influenced by Polish popular music . He remained at the forefront of all new musical tendencies , and his music stands as an important link between the late Baroque and early Classical styles . The Telemann Museum in Hamburg is dedicated to him",

Its full title is Die Ungleiche Heirat zwischen Vespetta und Pimpinone oder Das herrsch-s\u00fcchtige Camer M\u00e4gden ( The Unequal Marriage Between Vespetta and Pimpinone or The Domineering Chambermaid ) . The work is described as a Lustiges Zwischenspiel ( comic intermezzo ) in three parts . It was first performed at the Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt in Hamburg on 27 September 1725 as light relief between the acts of Telemann 's adaptation of Handel 's opera seria Tamerlano . Pimpinone was highly successful and pointed the way forward to later intermezzi , particularly Giovanni Battista Pergolesi 's La serva padrona",

Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712 ; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727 . He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition . Within fifteen years , Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera . Musicologist Winton Dean writes that his operas show that Handel was not only a great composer ; he was a dramatic genius of the first order . As Alexander 's Feast ( 1736 ) was well received , Handel made a transition to English choral works . After his success with Messiah ( 1742 ) he never composed an Italian opera again . Almost blind , and having lived in England for nearly fifty years , he died in 1759 , a respected and rich man . His funeral was given full state honours , and he was buried in Westminster Abbey in London . Born the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and Domenico Scarlatti , Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era , with works such as Messiah , Water Music , and Music for the Royal Fireworks remaining steadfastly popular",

A composer of both secular and sacred music , and a pioneer in the development of opera , he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history . Born in Cremona , where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions , Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua ( c. 1590-1613 ) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco . His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period , including problems of income , patronage and politics . Much of Monteverdi 's output , including many stage works , has been lost . His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals , large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine ( Vespers ) of 1610 , and three complete operas . His opera L'Orfeo ( 1607 ) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed ; towards the end of his life he wrote works for Venice , including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea . While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony , as evidenced in his madrigals , he undertook great developments in form and melody , and began to employ the basso continuo technique , distinctive of the Baroque . No stranger to controversy , he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica , contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica . Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries , his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century . He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded",
  "/wiki/L'Orfeo": "L'Orfeo ( SV 318 ) ( Italian pronunciation : [ lor\u02c8f\u025b\u02d0o ] ) , sometimes called La favola d'Orfeo [ la \u02c8fa\u02d0vola dor\u02c8f\u025b\u02d0o ] , is a late Renaissance/early Baroque favola in musica , or opera , by Claudio Monteverdi , with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio . It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus , and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world . It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua . While Jacopo Peri 's Dafne is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre , and the earliest surviving opera is Peri 's Euridice , L'Orfeo is the earliest that is still regularly performed . By the early 17th century the traditional intermedio - a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play - was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or opera . Monteverdi 's L'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre . After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua , and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years . Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615 . After the composer 's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years , and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances . At first these performances tended to be concert ( unstaged ) versions within institutes and music societies , but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris , in 1911 , the work began to be seen in theatres . After the Second World War many recordings were issued , and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses , although some leading venues resisted it . In 2007 , the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world",
  "/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach": "Johann Sebastian Bach [ a ] ( 31 March [ O.S . 21 March ] 1685 - 28 July 1750 ) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period . He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations , and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor . Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 . In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions",
  "/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [ a ] ( 27 January 1756 - 5 December 1791 ) , baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart , [ b ] was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period . Born in Salzburg , Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood . Already competent on keyboard and violin , he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty . At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position . While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position . He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security . During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35 . The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized . He composed more than 600 works , many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music . He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music . Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart , and Joseph Haydn wrote : posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years",
  "/wiki/Requiem_(Mozart)": "The Requiem in D minor , K. 626 , is a requiem mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756-1791 ) . Mozart composed part of the Requiem in Vienna in late 1791 , but it was unfinished at his death on 5 December the same year . A completed version dated 1792 by Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr was delivered to Count Franz von Walsegg , who commissioned the piece for a Requiem service to commemorate the anniversary of his wife 's death on 14 February . The autograph manuscript shows the finished and orchestrated Introit in Mozart 's hand , and detailed drafts of the Kyrie and the sequence Dies irae as far as the first eight bars of the Lacrimosa movement , and the Offertory . It can not be shown to what extent S\u00fcssmayr may have depended on now lost scraps of paper for the remainder ; he later claimed the Sanctus , the Benedictus and Agnus Dei as his own . Walsegg probably intended to pass the Requiem off as his own composition , as he is known to have done with other works . This plan was frustrated by a public benefit performance for Mozart 's widow Constanze . She was responsible for a number of stories surrounding the composition of the work , including the claims that Mozart received the commission from a mysterious messenger who did not reveal the commissioner 's identity , and that Mozart came to believe that he was writing the requiem for his own funeral . In addition to the S\u00fcssmayr version , a number of alternative completions have been developed by musicologists in the 20th century",

He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music . Internationally he is best known for his opera The Bartered Bride and for the symphonic cycle M\u00e1 vlast ( My Homeland ) , which portrays the history , legends and landscape of the composer 's native Bohemia . It contains the famous symphonic poem Vltava , also known by its English name The Moldau . Smetana was naturally gifted as a composer , and gave his first public performance at the age of 6 . After conventional schooling , he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague . His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising , in which he briefly participated . After failing to establish his career in Prague , he left for Sweden , where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg , and began to write large-scale orchestral works . During this period of his life Smetana was twice married ; of six daughters , three died in infancy . In the early 1860s , a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague . He threw himself into the musical life of the city , primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera . In 1866 his first two operas , The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride , were premiered at Prague 's new Provisional Theatre , the latter achieving great popularity",

He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally , bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States . He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood . From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style - a task that did not prove easy",

It was composed no later than July 1688 , and had been performed at Josias Priest 's girls ' school in London by the end of 1689 . Some scholars argue for a date of composition as early as 1683 . The story is based on Book IV of Virgil 's Aeneid . It recounts the love of Dido , Queen of Carthage , for the Trojan hero Aeneas , and her despair when he abandons her . A monumental work in Baroque opera , Dido and Aeneas is remembered as one of Purcell 's foremost theatrical works . It was also Purcell 's only true opera , as well as his only all-sung dramatic work . One of the earliest known English operas , it owes much to John Blow 's Venus and Adonis , both in structure and in overall effect . The influence of Cavalli 's opera Didone is also apparent .

It was set up by a group of players who left Henry Wood 's Queen 's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services . The LSO itself later introduced a similar rule for its members . From the outset the LSO was organised on co-operative lines , with all players sharing the profits at the end of each season . This practice continued for the orchestra 's first four decades . The LSO underwent periods of eclipse in the 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality to new London orchestras , to which it lost players and bookings : the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic in the 1930s and the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic after the Second World War . The profit-sharing principle was abandoned in the post-war era as a condition of receiving public subsidy for the first time . In the 1950s the orchestra debated whether to concentrate on film work at the expense of symphony concerts ; many senior players left when the majority of players rejected the idea . By the 1960s the LSO had recovered its leading position , which it has retained subsequently .

The influence of Tchaikovsky , Rimsky-Korsakov , Balakirev , Mussorgsky , and other Russian composers is seen in his early works , later giving way to a personal style notable for song-like melodicism , expressiveness and rich orchestral colors . Born into a musical family , Rachmaninoff took up the piano at the age of four . He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1892 , having already composed several piano and orchestral pieces . In 1897 , following the negative critical reaction to his Symphony No . 1 , Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received Piano Concerto No . 2 in 1901 . In the course of the next sixteen years , Rachmaninoff conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre , relocated to Dresden , Germany , and toured the United States for the first time . Rachmaninoff often featured the piano in his compositions , and he explored the expressive possibilities of the instrument through his own skills as a pianist . Following the Russian Revolution , Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia ; in 1918 , they settled in the United States , first in New York City",

He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term . In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France 's greatest living composer . Born to a music-loving family , Ravel attended France 's premier music college , the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment , whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal . After leaving the conservatoire , Ravel found his own way as a composer , developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of baroque , neoclassicism and , in his later works , jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form , as in his best-known work , Bol\u00e9ro ( 1928 ) , in which repetition takes the place of development . He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers ' music , of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known . A slow and painstaking worker , Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries . Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano , chamber music , two piano concertos , ballet music , two operas and eight song cycles ; he wrote no symphonies or church music . Many of his works exist in two versions : first , a piano score and later an orchestration . Some of his piano music , such as Gaspard de la nuit ( 1908 ) , is exceptionally difficult to play , and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 ( 1912 ) require skilful balance in performance . Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public",

The next ten years were a golden age in the musical tradition of Hamburg : Bernhard and his good friend Matthias Weckmann performed together and directed the latest compositions from Italy and Vienna , as well as composing an important collection of music in finely-wrought counterpoint . The Elector of Saxony recalled Bernhard to Dresden in 1674 , where he returned as assistant kapellmeister . Six years later , the large - and primarily Italian - musical establishment in the city was greatly reduced , until Bernhard remained the only kapellmeister at court . He continued composing , directing and caring for the music library in Dresden until his death in 1692 , at the age of 64 .
