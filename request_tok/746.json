[ note 1 ] NASA was established in 1958 , succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) . The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation , encouraging peaceful applications in space science . Since its establishment , most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA , including the Apollo Moon landing missions , the Skylab space station , and later the Space Shuttle . NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles . The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches . NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System ; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate 's Heliophysics Research Program ; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons ; and researching astrophysics topics , such as the Big Bang , through the Great Observatories and associated programs .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_Coleman": "Douglas L. Coleman ( 6 October 1931 - 16 April 2014 ) was a scientist and professor at The Jackson Laboratory , in Bar Harbor , Maine . His work predicted that the ob gene encoded the hormone leptin , later co-discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey Friedman , Rudolph Leibel and their research teams at Rockefeller University . This work has had a major role in our understanding of the mechanisms regulating body weight and that cause of human obesity . Coleman was born in Stratford , Ontario . He obtained his BS degree from McMaster University in 1954 and his PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin in 1958 . He was elected a member of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1998 . He won the Shaw Prize in 2009 , the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2010 , the 2012 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Biomedicine category and the 2013 King Faisal International Prize for Medicine jointly with Jeffrey M.

  "/wiki/Leptin": "Leptin ( from Greek \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 leptos , thin ) is a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells and enterocytes in the small intestine that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger , which in turn diminishes fat storage in adipocytes . Leptin acts on cell receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus . Although regulation of fat stores is deemed to be the primary function of leptin , it also plays a role in other physiological processes , as evidenced by its many sites of synthesis other than fat cells , and the many cell types beyond hypothalamic cells that have leptin receptors . Many of these additional functions are yet to be defined . In obesity , a decreased sensitivity to leptin occurs ( similar to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes ) , resulting in an inability to detect satiety despite high energy stores and high levels of leptin .",

He is known for his leadership in evidence-based medicine , a term that first appeared in a single-author paper he published in 1991 . Subsequently , a 1992 JAMA article that Guyatt led proved instrumental in bringing the concept of evidence-based medicine to the worlds attention . In 2007 , The BMJ launched an international election for the most important contributions to healthcare . Evidence-based medicine came 7th , ahead of the computer and medical imaging .

  "/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine": "Evidence-based medicine ( EBM ) is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research . Although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support , EBM goes further , classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types ( coming from meta-analyses , systematic reviews , and randomized controlled trials ) can yield strong recommendations ; weaker types ( such as from case-control studies ) can yield only weak recommendations . The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients . Use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations ( evidence-based practice policies ) . It has subsequently spread to describe an approach to decision-making that is used at virtually every level of health care as well as other fields ( evidence-based practice ) . Whether applied to medical education , decisions about individuals , guidelines and policies applied to populations , or administration of health services in general , evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible , decisions and policies should be based on evidence , not just the beliefs of practitioners , experts , or administrators . It thus tries to assure that a clinician 's opinion , which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases , is supplemented with all available knowledge from the scientific literature so that best practice can be determined and applied . It promotes the use of formal , explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers . It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students , practitioners , and policy makers .",

In 2019 , over 35,000 personnel - mostly local doctors , nurses and other medical professionals , logistical experts , water and sanitation engineers and administrators - provided medical aid in over 70 countries . Private donors provide about 90 % of the organisation 's funding , while corporate donations provide the rest , giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US $ 1.63 billion . M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res was founded in 1971 , in the aftermath of the Biafra secession , by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race , religion , creed or political affiliation . To that end , the organisation emphasises independence and impartiality , and explicitly precludes political , economic , or religious factors in its decision making . For these reasons , it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations . These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war , corruption , or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being . Only once in its history , during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda , has the organisation called for military intervention . MSF 's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter , the Chantilly Principles , and the later La Mancha Agreement . Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document . MSF has an associative structure , where operational decisions are made , largely independently , by the five operational centres ( Amsterdam , Barcelona-Athens , Brussels , Geneva and Paris ) . Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council , in which each of the 24 sections ( national offices ) is represented .",
