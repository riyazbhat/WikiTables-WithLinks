A determined opponent of the spread of slavery in the years leading up to the American Civil War , he was a prominent figure in the Republican Party in its formative years , and was praised for his work on behalf of the Union as Secretary of State during the Civil War . Seward was born in 1801 in the village of Florida , in Orange County , New York , where his father was a farmer and owned slaves . He was educated as a lawyer and moved to the Central New York town of Auburn . Seward was elected to the New York State Senate in 1830 as an Anti-Mason . Four years later , he became the gubernatorial nominee of the Whig Party . Though he was not successful in that race , Seward was elected governor in 1838 and won a second two-year term in 1840 . During this period , he signed several laws that advanced the rights of and opportunities for black residents , as well as guaranteeing fugitive slaves jury trials in the state . The legislation protected abolitionists , and he used his position to intervene in cases of freed black people who were enslaved in the South . After many years of practicing law in Auburn , he was elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1849 . Seward 's strong stances and provocative words against slavery brought him hatred in the South . He was re-elected to the Senate in 1855 , and soon joined the nascent Republican Party , becoming one of its leading figures .",

To secure its independence , the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in the South , and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union . As the leader of moderate Republicans , Lincoln found his political opposition was manifold , and included Radical Republicans , War Democrats , Copperheads ( anti-war Democrats ) , and irreconcilable secessionists .",
