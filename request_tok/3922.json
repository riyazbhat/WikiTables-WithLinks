The text is written in the form of a prose and verse travel diary and was penned as Bash\u014d made an epic and dangerous journey on foot through the Edo Japan of the late 17th century . While the poetic work became seminal of its own account , the poet 's travels in the text have since inspired many people to follow in his footsteps and trace his journey for themselves . In one of its most memorable passages , Bash\u014d suggests that every day is a journey , and the journey itself home . The text was also influenced by the works of Du Fu , who was highly revered by Bash\u014d . Of Oku no Hosomichi , Kenji Miyazawa once suggested , It was as if the very soul of Japan had itself written it ."
