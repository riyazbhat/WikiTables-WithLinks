Financial services companies are present in all economically developed geographic locations and tend to cluster in local , national , regional and international financial centers such as London , New York City , and Tokyo .",
  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80 % of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80 % or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name .",
  "/wiki/Finance": "Finance is the study of money and how it is used . Specifically , it deals with the questions of how an individual , company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they then spend or invest that money . Finance is , correspondingly , often split into three areas : personal finance , corporate finance and public finance . At the same time , finance is about the overall system - i.e . the financial markets that allow the flow of money , via investments and other financial instruments , between and within these areas ; this flow is facilitated by the financial services sector . A major focus within finance is thus investment management - called money management for individuals , and asset management for institutions - and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading , investment banking , financial engineering , and risk management . More abstractly , finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time : i.e . it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today , based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes , incorporating the time value of money ( determining the present value of these future values , discounting , requires a risk-appropriate discount rate ) . As an academic field , finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management , ( financial ) economics , accountancy and applied mathematics . Correspondingly , given its wide application , there are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field . As the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open , there have been recent efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance .",
  "/wiki/Property": "Property in the abstract is what belongs to or with something , whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing . In the context of this article , it is one or more components ( rather than attributes ) , whether physical or incorporeal , of a person 's estate ; or so belonging to , as in being owned by , a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society . Depending on the nature of the property , an owner of property has the right to consume , alter , share , redefine , rent , mortgage , pawn , sell , exchange , transfer , give away or destroy it , or to exclude others from doing these things , as well as to perhaps abandon it ; whereas regardless of the nature of the property , the owner thereof has the right to properly use it ( as a durable , mean or factor , or whatever ) , or at the very least exclusively keep it . In economics and political economy , there are three broad forms of property : private property , public property , and collective property ( also called cooperative property ) . Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways , whether simply or complexly , whether equally or unequally . However , there is an expectation that each party 's will ( rather discretion ) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional , [ citation needed ] so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent . The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous , or alternately every given one of them , when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists , may expect his , her , its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute . The Restatement ( First ) of Property defines property as anything , tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing . This mediating relationship between individual , property and state is called a property regime . In sociology and anthropology , property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object , in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object . The distinction between collective property and private property is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object . Important widely recognized types of property include real property ( the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land ) , personal property ( physical possessions belonging to a person ) , private property ( property owned by legal persons , business entities or individual natural persons ) , public property ( state owned or publicly owned and available possessions ) and intellectual property ( exclusive rights over artistic creations , inventions , etc .",
  "/wiki/Parking_garage": "A multistorey car park ( UK English ) or parking garage ( US English ; also called a multistorey , parkade ( mainly Canadian ) , parking structure , parking ramp , parking deck or indoor parking ) is a building designed for car parking and where there are a number of floors or levels on which parking takes place . It is essentially an indoor , stacked car park . Parking structures may be heated if they are enclosed . Design of parking structures can add considerable cost for planning new developments , and can be mandated by cities or states in new building parking requirements . Some cities such as London have abolished previously enacted minimum parking requirements .",
  "/wiki/Forestry": "Forestry is the science and craft of creating , managing , using , conserving , and repairing forests , woodlands , and associated resources for human and environmental benefits . Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands . The science of forestry has elements that belong to the biological , physical , social , political and managerial sciences . Modern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns , in what is known as multiple-use management , including the provision of timber , fuel wood , wildlife habitat , natural water quality management , recreation , landscape and community protection , employment , aesthetically appealing landscapes , biodiversity management , watershed management , erosion control , and preserving forests as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide . A practitioner of forestry is known as a forester . Other common terms are : a verderer , or a silviculturalist . Silviculture is narrower than forestry , being concerned only with forest plants , but is often used synonymously with forestry . Forest ecosystems have come to be seen as the most important component of the biosphere , and forestry has emerged as a vital applied science , craft , and technology . Forestry is an important economic segment in various industrial countries . For example , in Germany , forests cover nearly a third of the land area , wood is the most important renewable resource , and forestry supports more than a million jobs and about \u20ac181 billion of value to the German economy each year .",

  "/wiki/Diamond": "Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic . At room temperature and pressure , another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form , but diamond almost never converts to it . Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material , properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools . They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth . Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid , few types of impurity can contaminate it ( two exceptions being boron and nitrogen ) . Small numbers of defects or impurities ( about one per million of lattice atoms ) color diamond blue ( boron ) , yellow ( nitrogen ) , brown ( defects ) , green ( radiation exposure ) , purple , pink , orange or red . Diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ( ability to disperse light of different colors ) . Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years . Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres ( 93 and 155 mi ) in the Earth 's mantle , although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Under high pressure and temperature , carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds . Much more recently ( tens to hundreds of million years ago ) , they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites . Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gas by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) .",

  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",
  "/wiki/Metallurgy": "Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements , their inter-metallic compounds , and their mixtures , which are called alloys . Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals . That is , the way in which science is applied to the production of metals , and the engineering of metal components used in products for both consumers and manufacturers . Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking . Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement . A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a Metallurgist . The science of metallurgy is subdivided into two broad categories : chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy . Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals , and the chemical performance of metals . Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing , the extraction of metals , thermodynamics , electrochemistry , and chemical degradation ( corrosion ) . In contrast , physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals , the physical properties of metals , and the physical performance of metals . Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography , material characterization , mechanical metallurgy , phase transformations , and failure mechanisms . Historically , metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals .",
  "/wiki/Chromium": "Chromium is a chemical element with the symbol Cr and atomic number 24 . It is the first element in group 6 . It is a steely-grey , lustrous , hard and brittle transition metal . Chromium is the main additive in stainless steel , to which it adds anti-corrosive properties . Chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing . Polished chromium reflects almost 70 % of the visible spectrum , with almost 90 % of infrared light being reflected . The name of the element is derived from the Greek word \u03c7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 , chr\u014dma , meaning color , because many chromium compounds are intensely colored . Ferrochromium alloy is commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium . Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness . A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel . Stainless steel and chrome plating ( electroplating with chromium ) together comprise 85 % of the commercial use . In the United States , trivalent chromium ( Cr ( III ) ) ion is considered an essential nutrient in humans for insulin , sugar and lipid metabolism .",

  "/wiki/Motor_vehicle": "A motor vehicle , also known as motorized vehicle or automotive vehicle , is a self-propelled vehicle , commonly wheeled , that does not operate on rails ( such as trains or trams or 4-wheelers ) and is used for the transportation of people or cargo . The vehicle propulsion is provided by an engine or motor , usually an internal combustion engine or an electric motor , or some combination of the two , such as hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids . For legal purposes , motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including cars , buses , motorcycles , off-road vehicles , light trucks and regular trucks . These classifications vary according to the legal codes of each country . ISO 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicle types , terms and definitions . Generally , to avoid requiring handicapped persons from having to possess an operator 's license to use one , or requiring tags and insurance , powered wheelchairs will be specifically excluded by law from being considered motor vehicles .

  "/wiki/Manufacturing": "Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines , tools , chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry . The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design , in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale . Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products ( such as aircraft , household appliances , furniture , sports equipment or automobiles ) , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers ( usually through wholesalers , who in turn sell to retailers , who then sell them to individual customers ) . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product . The manufacturing process begins with the product design , and materials specification from which the product is made . These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part . Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product 's components . Some industries , such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead . The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design .

  "/wiki/Information_management": "Information management ( IM ) concerns a cycle of organizational activity : the acquisition of information from one or more sources , the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it , and its ultimate disposition through archiving or deletion . This cycle of organisational involvement with information involves a variety of stakeholders , including those who are responsible for assuring the quality , accessibility and utility of acquired information ; those who are responsible for its safe storage and disposal ; and those who need it for decision making . Stakeholders might have rights to originate , change , distribute or delete information according to organisational information management policies . Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management , including the planning , organizing , structuring , processing , controlling , evaluation and reporting of information activities , all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information . These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people . After individuals are able to put that information to use , it then gains more value . Information management is closely related to , and overlaps with , the management of data , systems , technology , processes and - where the availability of information is critical to organisational success - strategy . This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier , more traditional view , that the life cycle of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures , organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a product or a service .",

  "/wiki/Archiving": "An archive is an accumulation of historical records or the physical place they are located . Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization 's lifetime , and are kept to show the function of that person or organization . Professional archivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal , commercial , administrative , or social activities . They have been metaphorically defined as the secretions of an organism , and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity . In general , archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural , historical , or evidentiary value . Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique , unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist . This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization , although archival collections can often be found within library buildings . A person who works in archives is called an archivist . The study and practice of organizing , preserving , and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science . The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive ( more usual in the United Kingdom ) , an archives ( more usual in the United States ) , or a repository . When referring to historical records or the places they are kept , the plural form archives is chiefly used . The computing use of the term 'archive ' should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term .",

IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies . IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology ( ICT ) . An information technology system ( IT system ) is generally an information system , a communications system or , more specifically speaking , a computer system - including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment - operated by a limited group of users . Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology ( IT ) . Their definition consists of three categories : techniques for processing , the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs . The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks , but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones . Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology , including computer hardware , software , electronics , semiconductors , internet , telecom equipment , and e-commerce .

  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40 % of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25 % of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China .

  "/wiki/Gold": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au ( from Latin : aurum ) and atomic number 79 , making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental ( native ) form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver ( as electrum ) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium ( gold tellurides ) . Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction .

The metal is found in the Earth 's crust in the pure , free elemental form ( native silver ) , as an alloy with gold and other metals , and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite . Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper , gold , lead , and zinc refining . Silver has long been valued as a precious metal . Silver metal is used in many bullion coins , sometimes alongside gold : while it is more abundant than gold , it is much less abundant as a native metal . Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis ; a 94 % -pure alloy is described as 0.940 fine . As one of the seven metals of antiquity , silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures . Other than in currency and as an investment medium ( coins and bullion ) , silver is used in solar panels , water filtration , jewellery , ornaments , high-value tableware and utensils ( hence the term silverware ) , in electrical contacts and conductors , in specialized mirrors , window coatings , in catalysis of chemical reactions , as a colorant in stained glass and in specialised confectionery . Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film . Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides ( oligodynamic effect ) , added to bandages and wound-dressings , catheters , and other medical instruments .",
  "/wiki/Base_metal": "A base metal is a common and inexpensive metal , as opposed to a precious metal such as gold or silver . A long-time goal of alchemists was the transmutation of a base ( low grade ) metal into a precious metal . In numismatics , coins often derived their value from the precious metal content ; however , base metals have also been used in coins in the past and today .",

  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14 % of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",

  "/wiki/Life_insurance": "Life insurance ( or life assurance , especially in the Commonwealth of Nations ) is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer , where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money ( the benefit ) in exchange for a premium , upon the death of an insured person ( often the policy holder ) . Depending on the contract , other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment . The policy holder typically pays a premium , either regularly or as one lump sum . Other expenses , such as funeral expenses , can also be included in the benefits . Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events . Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer ; common examples are claims relating to suicide , fraud , war , riot , and civil commotion . Modern life insurance bears some similarity to the asset management industry and life insurers have diversified their products into retirement products such as annuities . Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories :",
  "/wiki/Employee_benefits": "Employee benefits and ( especially in British English ) benefits in kind ( also called fringe benefits , perquisites , or perks ) include various types of non-wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries . Instances where an employee exchanges ( cash ) wages for some other form of benefit is generally referred to as a salary packaging or salary exchange arrangement . In most countries , most kinds of employee benefits are taxable to at least some degree . Examples of these benefits include : housing ( employer-provided or employer-paid ) furnished or not , with or without free utilities ; group insurance ( health , dental , life etc . ) ; disability income protection ; retirement benefits ; daycare ; tuition reimbursement ; sick leave ; vacation ( paid and unpaid ) ; social security ; profit sharing ; employer student loan contributions ; conveyancing ; domestic help ( servants ) ; and other specialized benefits . The purpose of employee benefits is to increase the economic security of staff members , and in doing so , improve worker retention across the organization . As such , it is one component of reward management . Colloquially , perks are those benefits of a more discretionary nature . Often , perks are given to employees who are doing notably well or have seniority . Common perks are take-home vehicles , hotel stays , free refreshments , leisure activities on work time ( golf , etc . ) , stationery , allowances for lunch , and - when multiple choices exist - first choice of such things as job assignments and vacation scheduling . They may also be given first chance at job promotions when vacancies exist .",
  "/wiki/Health_insurance": "Health insurance is an insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses , spreading the risk over numerous persons . By estimating the overall risk of health care and health system expenses over the risk pool , an insurer can develop a routine finance structure , such as a monthly premium or payroll tax , to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement . The benefit is administered by a central organization such as a government agency , private business , or not-for-profit entity . According to the Health Insurance Association of America , health insurance is defined as coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury . It includes insurance for losses from accident , medical expense , disability , or accidental death and dismemberment ( p. 225 ) .",
  "/wiki/Asset_management": "Asset management refers to systematic approach to the governance and realization of value from the things that a group or entity is responsible for , over their whole life cycles . It may apply both to tangible assets ( physical objects such as buildings or equipment ) and to intangible assets ( such as human capital , intellectual property , goodwill and/or financial assets ) . Asset management is a systematic process of developing , operating , maintaining , upgrading , and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner ( including all costs , risks and performance attributes ) . The term is commonly used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others . Those include , for example , investment managers that manage the assets of a pension fund . It is also increasingly used in both the business world and public infrastructure sectors to ensure a coordinated approach to the optimization of costs , risks , service/performance and sustainability . The International Standard , ISO 55000 , provides an introduction and requirements specification for a management system for asset management .",
  "/wiki/Kegs": "A keg is a small barrel . Traditionally , a wooden keg is made by a cooper and used to transport items such as nails , gunpowder , and a variety of liquids . In recent times , a keg is often constructed of stainless steel . It is commonly used to store , transport , and serve beer . Other alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks , carbonated or non-carbonated , may be housed in a keg as well . Carbonated drinks are generally kept under pressure in order to maintain carbon dioxide in solution , preventing the beverage from becoming flat .",
  "/wiki/Transponders": "In telecommunication , a transponder is a device that , upon receiving a signal , emits a different signal in response . The term is a portmanteau of transmitter and responder . It is variously abbreviated as XPDR , XPNDR , TPDR or TP . In air navigation or radio frequency identification , a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal . In a communications satellite , a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies , usually from a satellite ground station . The transponder amplifies them , and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth , often without changing the content of the received signal or signals .",
  "/wiki/Software": "Computer software , or simply software , is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work . This is in contrast to physical hardware , from which the system is built and actually performs the work . In computer science and software engineering , computer software is all information processed by computer systems , programs and data . Computer software includes computer programs , libraries and related non-executable data , such as online documentation or digital media . Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own . At the lowest programming level , [ clarification needed ] executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor - typically a central processing unit ( CPU ) or a graphics processing unit ( GPU ) . A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state . For example , an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer - an effect that is not directly observable to the user . An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations , for example displaying some text on a computer screen ; causing state changes which should be visible to the user . The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided , unless it is instructed to jump to a different instruction , or is interrupted by the operating system . As of 2015 [ update ] , most personal computers , smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together , and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past . The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages ."
