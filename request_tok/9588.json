In 1912 , the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology ( CIT ) and began offering four-year degrees . During this time , CIT consisted of four constituent schools : the School of Fine and Applied Arts , the School of Apprentices and Journeymen , the School of Science and Technology , and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon ( who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father , Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927 , the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit . In 1937 , the Mellon Institute 's iconic building was completed and it moved to its new , and current , location on Fifth Avenue . In 1967 , with support from Paul Mellon , Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University .
