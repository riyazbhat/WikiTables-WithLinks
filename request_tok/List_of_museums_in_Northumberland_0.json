  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record , bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England 's historic environment .

The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen .

Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines , due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds .

While early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions of species , ornithologists today seek answers to very specific questions , often using birds as models to test hypotheses or predictions based on theories . Most modern biological theories apply across taxonomic groups , and the number of professional scientists who identify themselves as ornithologists has therefore declined .

He gradually turned to illustrating , writing and publishing his own books , gaining an adult audience for the fine illustrations in A History of Quadrupeds . His career began when he was apprenticed to engraver Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne . He became a partner in the business and eventually took it over . Apprentices whom Bewick trained include John Anderson , Luke Clennell , and William Harvey , who in their turn became well known as painters and engravers . Bewick is best known for his A History of British Birds , which is admired today mainly for its wood engravings , especially the small , sharply observed , and often humorous vignettes known as tail-pieces . The book was the forerunner of all modern field guides . He notably illustrated editions of Aesop 's Fables throughout his life . He is credited with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood . He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain , producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type , but were much more durable than traditional woodcuts .

The estate was technologically advanced ; the architect of the house , Richard Norman Shaw , wrote that it was equipped with wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things . In the grounds , Armstrong built dams and lakes to power a sawmill , a water-powered laundry , early versions of a dishwasher and a dumb waiter , a hydraulic lift and a hydroelectric rotisserie . In 1887 , Armstrong was raised to the peerage , the first engineer or scientist to be ennobled , and became Baron Armstrong of Cragside . The original building consisted of a small shooting lodge which Armstrong built between 1862 and 1864 . In 1869 , he employed the architect Richard Norman Shaw to enlarge the site , and in two phases of work between 1869 and 1882 , they transformed the house into a northern Neuschwanstein . The result was described by the architect and writer Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel as one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture . Armstrong filled the house with a significant art collection ; he and his wife were patrons of many 19th-century British artists .
