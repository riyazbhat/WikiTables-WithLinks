  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",
  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",
  "/wiki/Bridge_No._5083-Marshall": "Bridge No . 5083-Marshall carries Minnesota State Highway 19 over the Redwood River in Marshall , Minnesota , United States . It was built 1931 and is one of two bridges on the historic register in the city . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 . Bridge No . 5083 was completed at a cost of $ 23,277 in October 1931 . This bridge is between a residential neighborhood on the south and the city 's main park on the north . The bridge design is two 37-foot ( 11 m ) concrete-girder spans on a concrete substructure . Eight lines of girders support the concrete deck , which accommodates a 40-foot ( 12 m ) , bituminous-surfaced roadway and two concrete sidewalks bordered by ornamental , open-balustrade , metal railings with concrete posts . Each railing supports two metal light standards detailed in the Classical Revival Style .

  "/wiki/Girder_bridge": "A girder bridge is a bridge that uses girders as the means of supporting its deck . The two most common types of modern steel girder bridge are plate and box . [ citation needed ] The term girder is often used interchangeably with beam in reference to bridge design . However , some authors define beam bridges slightly differently from girder bridges . A girder may be made of concrete or steel . Many shorter bridges , especially in rural areas where they may be exposed to water overtopping and corrosion , utilize concrete box girder . The term girder is typically used to refer to a steel beam . In a beam or girder bridge , the beams themselves are the primary support for the deck , and are responsible for transferring the load down to the foundation . Material type , shape , and weight all affect how much weight a beam can hold . Due to the properties of the second moment of area , the height of a girder is the most significant factor to affect its load capacity . Longer spans , more traffic , or wider spacing of the beams will all directly result in a deeper beam . In truss and arch-style bridges , the girders are still the main support for the deck , but the load is transferred through the truss or arch to the foundation .",

The park was acquired in 1934 , and development started in 1935 with workers from the Veterans Conservation Corps , an offshoot of the Civilian Conservation Corps . The landscape design in the park was planned by the National Park Service , and the master-planned development allowed the Redwood River to determine the placement of various functional areas in the park . After the VCC finished their development in 1936 , the Works Progress Administration dismantled the VCC camp buildings and built the Swimming Instructor 's Cabin and the Ice and Wood House . Thirteen buildings and structures , built by the VCC and the WPA , are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms , and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 . It responded to needs for relief , reform , and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",
  "/wiki/Sioux_Quartzite": "The Sioux Quartzite is a Proterozoic quartzite that is found in the region around the intersection of Minnesota , South Dakota , and Iowa , and correlates with other rock units throughout the upper midwestern and southwestern United States . It was formed by braided river deposits , and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then-southern side of the North American craton . In human history , it provided the catlinite , or pipestone , that was used by the Plains Indians to carve ceremonial pipes . With the arrival of Europeans , it was heavily quarried for building stone , and was used in many prominent structures in Sioux Falls , South Dakota and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest . Sioux Quartzite has been and continues to be quarried in Jasper , Minnesota at the Jasper Stone Company and Quarry , which itself was posted to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5 , 1978 . Jasper , Minnesota contains many turn-of-the-century quartzite buildings , including the school , churches and several other public and private structures , mostly abandoned .",

  "/wiki/Kiel_and_Morgan_Hotel": "The Kiel and Morgan Hotel in Lynd , Minnesota , United States , was the building first used on a regular basis as the Lyon County Courthouse .

On August 12 , 1870 , the county commissioners held their first meeting in the home of Luman Ticknor in upper Lynd . The Hotel was built in 1871 by Allen D. Morgan and Levi Kiel . Because of the small population in the area , the hotel served variously as the seat of county government , post office , store , and church . The Kiel and Morgan Hotel is an important historical place because it is one of the few remaining examples of the type of buildings that were used for both private and government meeting places during the early settlement of the western Minnesota counties . After the county government moved to Marshall , where it remains today , the hotel was used as a farm house . In 1990 , the owner Eva Schrunk donated the property to the city of Lynd .",
