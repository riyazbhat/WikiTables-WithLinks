  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events .",

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

  "/wiki/110_metres_hurdles": "The 110 metres hurdles , or 110-metre hurdles , is a hurdling track and field event for men . It is included in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympic Games . The female counterpart is the 100 metres hurdles . As part of a racing event , ten hurdles of 1.067 metres ( 3.5 ft or 42 inches ) in height are evenly spaced along a straight course of 110 metres . They are positioned so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner . Fallen hurdles do not carry a fixed time penalty for the runners , but they have a significant pull-over weight which slows down the run . Like the 100 metres sprint , the 110 metres hurdles begins in the starting blocks . For the 110 m hurdles , the first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13.72 metres ( 45 ft ) from the starting line . The next nine hurdles are set at a distance of 9.14 metres ( 30 ft ) from each other , and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 14.02 metres ( 46 ft ) long . The Olympic Games have included the 110 metre hurdles in their program since 1896 . The equivalent hurdles race for women was run over a course of 80 metres from 1932 to 1968 . Starting with the 1972 Summer Olympics , the women 's race was set at 100 metres .",

Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic hurricane belt . Its capital and largest city is Bridgetown .

The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536 , but later abandoned it in 1620 ; with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited , and to replenish their water supply . An English ship , the Olive Blossom , arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625 ; its men took possession of it in the name of King James I . In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English and later British colony . As a wealthy sugar colony , it became an English centre of the African slave trade until that trade was outlawed in 1807 , with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years from 1833 .",

On a standard outdoor track , 400 metres is the length of the inside lane , once around the stadium . Runners stay in their lanes the entire way after starting out of the blocks and must clear ten hurdles that are evenly spaced around the track . The hurdles are positioned and weighted so that they fall forward if bumped into with sufficient force , to prevent injury to the runners . Although there is no longer any penalty for knocking hurdles over , runners prefer to clear them cleanly , as touching them during the race slows runners down . The best male athletes can run the 400 m hurdles in a time of around 47 seconds , while the best female athletes achieve a time of around 53 seconds . The current men 's and women 's world record holders are Kevin Young with 46.78 seconds and Dalilah Muhammad with 52.16 seconds . Compared to the 400 metres run , the hurdles race takes the men about three seconds longer and the women four seconds longer . The 400 m hurdles was held for both sexes at the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Athletics . The first championship for women came at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics - being held as a one-off due to the lack of a race at the 1980 Summer Olympics .",

It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous , African , and European elements .

It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate , even at a basic level . A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics , including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg , reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports . Running speed , however , may be the most dominant factor . Physical attributes such as speed , agility and strength are essential to pole vaulting effectively , but technical skill is an equally if not more important element . The object of pole vaulting is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights ( standards ) without knocking it down .",
