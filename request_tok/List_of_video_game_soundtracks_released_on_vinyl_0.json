  "/wiki/Record_Label": "A record label , or record company , is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos . Sometimes , a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks , coordinates the production , manufacture , distribution , marketing , promotion , and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos , while also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ( artists and repertoire or A & R ) , and maintaining contracts with recording artists and their managers .

Within the mainstream music industry , recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base , market their albums , and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services , radio , and television .
