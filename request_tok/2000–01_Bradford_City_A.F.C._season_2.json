  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",
