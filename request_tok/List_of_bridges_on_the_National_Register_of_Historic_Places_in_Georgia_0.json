  "/wiki/Town_lattice_truss": "A lattice bridge is a form of truss bridge that uses many small , closely spaced diagonal elements forming a lattice . The lattice Truss Bridge was patented in 1820 by architect Ithiel Town . Originally a design to allow a substantial bridge to be made from planks employing lower-skilled labor , rather than heavy timbers and more expensive carpenters , this type of bridge has also been constructed using many relatively light iron or steel members . The individual elements are more easily handled by the construction workers , but the bridge also requires substantial support during construction . A simple lattice truss will transform the applied loads into a thrust , as the bridge will tend to change length under load . This is resisted by pinning the lattice members to the top and bottom chords , which are more substantial than the lattice members , but which may also be fabricated from relatively small elements rather than large beams .",
