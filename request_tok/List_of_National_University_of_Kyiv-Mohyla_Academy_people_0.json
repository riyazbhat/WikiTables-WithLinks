The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure , including the Kiev Metro . The city 's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi , one of its four legendary founders . During its history , Kiev , one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe , passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity . The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century .

The ROC currently claims its exclusive jurisdiction over the Orthodox Christians , irrespective of their ethnic background , who reside in the former member republics of the Soviet Union , excluding Georgia and Armenia , although this claim is disputed in such countries as Estonia , Moldova and Ukraine and consequently parallel canonical Orthodox jurisdictions exist in those : the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church , the Metropolis of Bessarabia , and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine , respectively .

Since 1925 , the Church 's Primate bears the title of Patriarch . Its jurisdiction covers the territories of Romania and Moldova , with additional dioceses for Romanians living in nearby Serbia and Hungary , as well as for diaspora communities in Central and Western Europe , North America and Oceania . Currently it is the only autocephalous Church within Eastern Orthodoxy to have a Romance language for liturgical use . The majority of Romania 's population ( 16,367,267 , or 85.9 % of those for whom data were available , according to the 2011 census data ) , as well as some 720,000 Moldovans , belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church .

He was elevated to the office of archbishop of Kiev by the tsar in 1731 , and he later convinced the church authorities to restore Kiev eparchy as a Kiev metropoly , whereupon he took the title Metropolitan of Kiev , Galich and Little Russia in 1743 . A supporter of Archbishop Teofan Prokopovych , Zaborovsky carried out the Russian government 's policy of destroying the autonomy of the Ukrainian church by instituting the Dukhovnyi reglament of 1721 and other synodal ukases . He did , however , raise the academic standards and improve the economic standing of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy . He published a new statute for the academy , reformed the curriculum ( adding new courses in more modern disciplines ) , and provided much money for the expansion of the academy 's buildings and for scholarships for poor students . The academy even briefly became known as the Mohyla-Zaborovsky Academy .

On 24 August 1690 , Adrian was chosen to replace Joachim on his post . Patriarch Adrian was a staunch adherent of traditional norms and opposed Peter the Great 's reforms ( e.g. , he criticized Peter 's decree on mandatory shaving of beards ) . Adrian 's relations with the tsar were tense ; however , he had to accept some of Peter 's criticism about deficiencies in management of the Russian Orthodox Church . Adrian sought to eradicate Latinizations in the Church in Ukraine . He introduced a confession requiring bishops-elect to state that the epiclesis , rather than the Words of Institution , transforms the gifts at the liturgy into the body and blood of Christ",
