It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic .

Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet .

The first day of the Islamic year is observed by Muslims on the first day of the month of Muharram . The epoch ( reference date ) of the Islamic era was set as 622 Common Era ( CE ) , the year of the emigration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina , known as the Hijra . All religious duties , such as prayer , fasting in the month of Ramadan , and pilgrimage , and the dates of significant events , such as celebration of holy nights and festivals , are calculated according to the Islamic calendar . While some Islamic organizations prefer determining the new month ( and hence the new year ) by local sightings of the moon , most Islamic institutions and countries , including Saudi Arabia , follow astronomical calculations to determine future dates of the Islamic calendar . There are various schemas for calculating the tabular Islamic calendar ( i.e . not based on observation ) , which results in differences of typically one or even two days between countries using such schema and those that use lunar sightings . For example , the Umm al-Qura calendar used in Saudi Arabia was reformed several times in recent years . The current scheme was introduced in 1423 AH ( 15 March 2002 ) . A day in the Islamic calendar is defined as beginning at sunset . For example , 1 Muharram 1432 was defined to correspond to 7 or 8 December 2010 in official calendars ( depending on the country ) . For an observation-based calendar , a sighting of the new moon at sunset of 6 December would mean that 1 Muharram lasted from the moment of sunset of 6 December to the moment of sunset of 7 December , while in places where the new moon was not sighted on 6 December , 1 Muharram would last from the moment of sunset of 7 December to the moment of sunset of 8 December .",

He is an important figure in Islam as he was a member of the Household of Muhammad ( Ahl al-Bayt ) and the People of the Cloak ( Ahl al-Kis\u0101 ' ) , as well as the third Shia Imam . Prior to his death , the Umayyad ruler Mu'awiya appointed his son Yazid as his successor , contrary to the Hasan-Muawiya treaty . When Muawiya died in 680 CE , Yazid demanded that Husayn pledge allegiance to him . Husayn refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid , even though it meant sacrificing his life . As a consequence , he left Medina , his hometown , to take refuge in Mecca in AH 60 . There , the people of Kufa sent letters to him , asking his help and pledging their allegiance to him . So he traveled towards Kufa , after getting some favorable indications along with a small caravan of his relatives and followers but near Karbala his caravan was intercepted by Yazid 's army . He was killed and beheaded in the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680 ( 10 Muharram 61 AH ) by Yazid , along with most of his family and companions , including Husayn 's six month old son , Ali al-Asghar , with the women and children taken as prisoners . Anger at Husayn 's death was turned into a rallying cry that helped undermine the Umayyad caliphate 's legitimacy , and ultimately its overthrow by the Abbasid Revolution . The annual commemoration of Husayn and his children , family and companions occurs during Muharram , the first month of the Islamic calendar , and the day he was martyred is known as Ashura ( the tenth day of Muharram , a day of mourning for Shi ' i Muslims ) .

According to Islamic doctrine , he was a prophet , sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached previously by Adam , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets . He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam , though some modern denominations diverge from this belief . [ n 3 ] Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity , with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief . He is referred to by many appellations , including Messenger of Allah , The Prophet Muhammad , Allah 's Apostle , Last Prophet of Islam , and others ; there are also many variant spellings of Muhammad , such as Mohamet , Mahamad , Muhamad , and many others . Born approximately 570 CE ( Year of the Elephant ) in the Arabian city of Mecca , Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six . He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib , and upon his death , by his uncle Abu Talib . In later years , he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer . When he was 40 , Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , and receiving his first revelation from God . Three years later , in 610 , Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that God is One , that complete submission ( isl\u0101m ) to God is the right way of life ( d\u012bn ) , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam . The followers of Muhammad were initially few in number , and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists . He sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615 to shield them from prosecution , before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in 622 .",

'Feast of the Sacrifice ' , IPA : [ \u0295i\u02d0d \u00e6l\u02c8\u0294\u0251d\u02e4\u0127\u00e6\u02d0 ] ) or Eid Qurban ( Persian : \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0642\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646 ) , also called the Festival of the Sacrifice , is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide each year ( the other being Eid al-Fitr ) , and considered the holier of the two . It honours the willingness of Ibrahim ( Abraham ) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God 's command . But , before Abraham could sacrifice his son , God provided a goat to sacrifice instead . In commemoration of this intervention , an animal is sacrificed ritually and divided into three parts . One share is given to the poor and needy , another is kept for home , and the third is given to relatives . In the Islamic lunar calendar , Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah , and lasts for four days . In the international ( Gregorian ) calendar , the dates vary from year to year shifting approximately 11 days earlier each year .",
  "/wiki/Abraham": "Abraham [ a ] ( n\u00e9 Abram ) [ b ] is the common patriarch of Christianity , Islam , Judaism , and some other religions . In Judaism , he is the founding father of the covenant of the pieces , the special relationship between the Hebrews and God ; in Christianity , he is the prototype of all believers , Jewish or Gentile ; and in Islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad . The narrative in the Book of Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land . Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny . Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham ; and , while promises are made to Ishmael about founding a great nation , Isaac , Abraham 's son by his half-sister Sarah , inherits God 's promises to Abraham . Abraham purchases a tomb ( the Cave of the Patriarchs ) at Hebron to be Sarah 's grave , thus establishing his right to the land ; and , in the second generation , his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin , thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance . Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons ; but , on his death , when he is buried beside Sarah , it is Isaac who receives all Abraham 's goods , while the other sons receive only gifts ( Genesis 25:5-8 ) . The Abraham story can not be definitively related to any specific time , and it is widely agreed that the patriarchal age , along with the exodus and the period of the judges , is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history . A common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early Persian period ( late 6th century BCE ) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their father Abraham , and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on Moses and the Exodus tradition ."
