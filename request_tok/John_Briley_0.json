He won recognition for his ministry , which he led from 1873 until his death in 1889 , in the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi for people with leprosy ( also known as Hansen 's disease ) , who were required to live under government-required medical quarantine in a settlement on the Kalaupapa Peninsula of Moloka\u02bbi . During this time , he taught the Catholic faith to the people of Hawaii . Father Damien also cared for the patients himself and established leadership within the community to build houses , schools , roads , hospitals , and churches . He dressed residents ' ulcers , built a reservoir , made coffins , dug graves , shared pipes , and ate poi from his hands with them , providing both medical and emotional support . After eleven years caring for the physical , spiritual , and emotional needs of those in the leper colony , Father Damien realized he had also contracted leprosy when he was scalded by hot water and felt no pain . He continued with his work despite the infection but finally succumbed to the disease on 15 April 1889 . Father Damien has been described as a martyr of charity . He was the tenth person in what is now the United States to be recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church . In both the Latin Rite and the Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church , Father Damien is venerated as a saint .

  "/wiki/Associate_producer": "A film producer is a person who oversees film production . Either employed by a production company or working independently , producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production , such as selecting the script ; coordinating writing , directing , and editing ; and arranging financing . During the discovery stage , the producer finds and selects promising material for development . Then , unless the film is based on an existing script , the producer has to hire a screenwriter and oversee the development of the script . Once a script is completed , the producer will lead a pitch to secure the financial backing ( a green light ) to allow production to begin . The producer also supervises the pre-production , production , and post-production stages of filmmaking . One of the most important tasks is to hire the director and other key crew members . Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production , the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations , though some directors also produce their own films . The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget , and has the final say on creative decisions . Finally , the producer will oversee the marketing and distribution . For various reasons , producers can not always supervise all of the production . In this case , the main producer or executive producer may hire and delegate work to associate producers , assistant producers , line producers or unit production managers",

His expeditions , sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain , were the first European contact with the Caribbean , Central America , and South America . Columbus 's early life is somewhat obscure , but scholars generally agree that he was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language . He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely , as far north as the British Isles ( and possibly Iceland ) and as far south as what is now Ghana . He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years , but later took a Castilian mistress ; he had one son with each woman . Though largely self-educated , Columbus was widely read in geography , astronomy , and history . He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies , hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade . Following persistent lobbying , Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west , in the name of the Crown of Castile . Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships , and after a stopover in the Canary Islands made landfall in the Americas on 12 October ( later celebrated as Columbus Day ) . His landing place was an island in the Bahamas , known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani ; its exact location is uncertain . Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola , establishing a colony in what is now Haiti - the first European settlement in the Americas since the Norse colonies nearly 500 years earlier .

In 1966 , he began studying medicine at the University of Natal , where he joined the National Union of South African Students ( NUSAS ) . Strongly opposed to the apartheid system of racial segregation and white-minority rule in South Africa , Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white liberals , rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid . He believed that even when well-intentioned , white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a paternalistic manner . He developed the view that to avoid white domination , black people had to organise independently , and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the South African Students ' Organisation ( SASO ) in 1968 . Membership was open only to blacks , a term that Biko used in reference not just to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians . He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals , but opposed anti-white racism and had various white friends and lovers . The white-minority National Party government were initially supportive , seeing SASO 's creation as a victory for apartheid 's ethos of racial separatism .

The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 ( Sanskrit : great-souled , venerable ) , first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa , is now used throughout the world . Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat , western India , Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple , London , and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891 . After two uncertain years in India , where he was unable to start a successful law practice , he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit . He went on to stay for 21 years . It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family , and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights . In 1915 , aged 45 , he returned to India . He set about organising peasants , farmers , and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination . Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule . The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth , or short dhoti and , in the winter , a shawl , both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel , or charkha , as a mark of identification with India 's rural poor . Thereafter , he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community , ate simple vegetarian food , and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest . Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians , Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km ( 250 mi ) Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942",

  "/wiki/Pope_Joan_(1972_film)": "Pope Joan is a 1972 American historical drama film based on the story of Pope Joan . Even though modern consensus generally disputes Pope Joan as legendary , in the film she is treated as fact . It was directed by Michael Anderson and has a cast which includes Liv Ullmann ( in the lead role ) , Olivia de Havilland , Lesley-Anne Down , Franco Nero and Maximilian Schell . The soundtrack was composed by Maurice Jarre with additional choral music provided by The Sistine Chapel Choir , directed by Domenico Bartolucci . The film was released on DVD in 2003 on Region 1 format disc . It was also re-titled in some areas as The Devil 's Imposter , with much material cut . The version of the film released in 1972 differed significantly from the version that had originally been filmed . Anderson 's original was made with flashbacks and flash-forward sequences about a modern-day evangelical preacher who believes her life parallels that of Pope Joan . In this version psychiatrists try to send her back through her past lives to establish if she is the reincarnation of Pope Joan . However , the distributor decided to have all of the contemporary sequences removed and released the film as a straightforward historical drama . In 2009 the film was re-edited and the previously unreleased footage was re-inserted . It was re-released under the title She\u2026 Who Would Be Pope",
  "/wiki/Pope_Joan": "Pope Joan ( Ioannes Anglicus ; 855-857 ) was , according to legend , a woman who reigned as pope for a few years during the Middle Ages . Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe . The story was widely believed for centuries , but most modern scholars regard it as fictional . Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man , often at the behest of a lover . In the most common accounts , due to her abilities , she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope . Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession , and she died shortly after , either through murder or of natural causes . The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot , and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male . In the 16th century , Siena Cathedral featured a bust of Joan among other pontiffs ; this was removed after protests in 1600 . Jean de Mailly 's chronicle , written around 1250 , contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope , and it inspired several more accounts over the next several years . The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into Martin of Opava 's Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum , later in the 13th century . Martin introduced details that the female pope 's birth name was John Anglicus of Mainz , that she reigned in the 9th century , and that she entered the church to follow her lover . The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century , when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question ; various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan 's supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts",
