  "/wiki/Mokpo": "Mokpo ( Korean pronunciation : [ mok\u031a.p\u02b0o ] ; Mokpo-si ) is a city in South Jeolla Province , South Korea , located at the southwestern tip of the Korean Peninsula , close to Yudal mountain . Mokpo has frequent train service connecting in Daejon to Seoul , and is the terminus for a number of ferry routes serving islands in the adjacent Yellow Sea and Dadohae National Maritime Park . During the Japanese Occupation ( 1910-1945 ) , Mokpo served as a crucial port for both commercial ventures and public transportation , due to its location along the sea routes between the Japanese archipelago and the Chinese mainland . The large number of islands surrounding Mokpo have also served as a protective barrier , making the city less vulnerable to high tides and tsunamis . In the occupation era , large residential areas were built to accommodate the Japanese colonists , which are now the city 's historic districts . The end of World War II and Korea 's independence in 1945 were responsible for the city slowly losing its position as a host to major government organizations and wartime industries . This led to a reduction in the size of Mokpo , which is currently a mid-sized city of the Honam region .",
