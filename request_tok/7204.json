  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Parliament_House,_Canberra": "Parliament House is the meeting place of the Parliament of Australia , located in Canberra , the capital of Australia . The building was designed by Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp Architects and built by a Concrete Constructions and John Holland joint venture . It was opened on 9 May 1988 by Elizabeth II , Queen of Australia . It cost more than A $ 1.1 billion to build . Federal Parliament meetings were held in Melbourne until 1927 . Between 1927 and 1988 , the Parliament of Australia met in the Provisional Parliament House , which is now known as Old Parliament House . Construction of Australia 's permanent Parliament House was delayed while its location was debated . Construction of the new building began in 1981 . The principal design of the structure is based on the shape of two boomerangs and is topped by an 81-metre ( 266 ft ) flagpole . Parliament House contains 4,700 rooms , and many areas are open to the public . The main foyer contains a marble staircase and leads to the Great Hall , which has a large tapestry on display . The House of Representatives chamber is decorated green , while the Senate chamber has a red colour scheme .",
  "/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia": "The Parliament of Australia ( officially the Federal Parliament , also called the Commonwealth Parliament ) is the legislative branch of the government of Australia . It consists of three elements : the Crown ( represented by the Governor-General ) , the Senate and the House of Representatives . The combination of two elected chambers , in which the members of the Senate represent the states and territories while the members of the House represent electoral divisions according to population , is modelled on the United States Congress . Through both chambers , however , there is a fused executive , drawn from the Westminster system . The upper house , the Senate , consists of 76 members : twelve for each state , and two each for the territories , Northern Territory ( including Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands ) and the Australian Capital Territory ( including Norfolk Island and the Jervis Bay Territory ) . Senators are elected using the single transferable vote proportional representation system and as a result , the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power . The governing party or coalition has not held a majority in the Senate since 1981 ( except between 2005 and 2007 ) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed . The lower house , the House of Representatives , currently consists of 151 members , each elected using full-preference instant-runoff voting from single-member constituencies known as electoral divisions ( and commonly referred to as electorates or seats ) . This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major political groups , the centre-right Coalition ( consisting of the Liberal and National Parties ) and the centre-left Labor Party . The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power . The House of Representatives has a maximum term of three years , although it can be dissolved early . The Senate has fixed terms , with 36 Senators ' terms expiring every three years ( the terms of the four territory Senators are linked to House elections ) .",
  "/wiki/Australian_Senate": "The Senate is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Australia , the lower house being the House of Representatives . The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Chapter I of the Constitution of Australia . There are a total of 76 Senators : 12 are elected from each of the six Australian states regardless of population and 2 from each of the two autonomous internal Australian territories ( the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory ) . Senators are popularly elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation . Unlike upper houses in other Westminster-style parliamentary systems , the Senate is vested with significant powers , including the capacity to reject all bills , including budget and appropriation bills , initiated by the government in the House of Representatives , making it a distinctive hybrid of British Westminster bicameralism and United States-style bicameralism . As a result of proportional representation , the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power . The governing party or coalition , which has to maintain the confidence of the lower house , has not held a majority in the Senate since 2005-2007 ( and before that since 1981 ) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and independents to get legislation passed .",

Its composition and powers are established in Chapter I of the Constitution of Australia . The term of members of the House of Representatives is a maximum of three years from the date of the first sitting of the House , but on only one occasion since Federation has the maximum term been reached . The House is almost always dissolved earlier , usually alone but sometimes in a double dissolution of both Houses . Elections for members of the House of Representatives are often held in conjunction with those for the Senate . A member of the House may be referred to as a Member of Parliament ( MP or Member ) , while a member of the Senate is usually referred to as a Senator . The government of the day and by extension the Prime Minister must achieve and maintain the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power . The House of Representatives currently consists of 151 members , elected by and representing single member districts known as electoral divisions ( commonly referred to as electorates or seats ) . The number of members is not fixed but can vary with boundary changes resulting from electoral redistributions , which are required on a regular basis . The most recent overall increase in the size of the House , which came into effect at the 1984 election , increased the number of members from 125 to 148 . It reduced to 147 at the 1993 election , returned to 148 at the 1996 election , has been 150 since the 2001 election , and has increased to 151 at the 2019 Australian federal election .

Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west , New Caledonia to the southwest , New Zealand 's Kermadec Islands to the southeast , Tonga to the east , the Samoas and France 's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast , and Tuvalu to the north . Fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands - of which 110 are permanently inhabited - and more than 500 islets , amounting to a total land area of about 18,300 square kilometres ( 7,100 sq mi ) . The most outlying island is Ono-i-Lau . The two major islands , Viti Levu and Vanua Levu , account for 87 % of the total population of 883,483 . The capital , Suva , on Viti Levu , serves as the country 's principal cruise-ship port . [ failed verification ] About three-quarters of Fijians live on Viti Levu 's coasts , either in Suva or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi - where tourism is the major local industry - or Lautoka , where the sugar-cane industry is paramount . Due to its terrain , the interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited . The majority of Fiji 's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago . Some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni . The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c. 35-60 degrees Celsius ) surface discharges . Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example .",

In terms with its Exclusive Economic Zone in the Pacific , it straddles all three primary geographic regions ; Banaba ( Melanesian-Micronesian Border ) , the Gilbert Islands ( Micronesia ) and the Line and Phoenix Islands ( Polynesia ) . Their spread straddles the equator and the 180th meridian , although the International Date Line goes round Kiribati and swings far to the east , almost reaching the 150\u00b0W meridian . This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands . Kiribati 's easternmost islands , the southern Line Islands , south of Hawaii , have the most advanced time on Earth : UTC+14 hours . Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres . Kiribati gained its independence from the United Kingdom , becoming a sovereign state in 1979 .

Additionally , its population of 10,670 is the world 's third smallest , after Vatican City and Tuvalu . Settled by people from Micronesia and Polynesia c. 1000 BCE , Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century . After World War I , Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . During World War II , Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops , and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific . After the war ended , the country entered into United Nations trusteeship . Nauru gained its independence in 1968 , and became a member of the Pacific Community ( SPC ) in 1969 .

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion ; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state .",

Each provincial member becomes governor of their province unless they take a ministerial position , in which case the governorship passes to an open member of the province . From 1964 until 1977 an Optional Preferential Voting System was used . [ citation needed ] The first past the post system was used from 1977 until 2002 . Electoral reforms introduced by former Prime Minister Mekere Morauta introduced Limited Preferential Voting , in which voters numbered three preferred candidates . LPV was first used nationally in the 2007 election . As in other Commonwealth realms , the party or coalition with the most seats in the parliament is invited by the Governor-General to form a government , and its leader subsequently becomes Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea .

Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 ( following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne , which lasted for sixty years , until 1640 , when the Portuguese monarchy was restored ) , Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain , as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies , and named it La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo . In the 1880s , France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago , and in 1906 , they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium . An independence movement arose in the 1970s , and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980 . Since independence , the country has become a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the Pacific Islands Forum ."
