  "/wiki/Association_football_positions": "In the sport of association football , each of the 11 players on a team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play . A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive , midfield , and attacking positions depending on the formation deployed . These positions describe both the player 's main role and their area of operation on the pitch . In the early development of the game , formations were much more offensively aggressive , with the 1-2-7 being prominent in the late 1800s . In the latter part of the 19th century , the 2-3-5 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this . In defence , there were full-backs , known as the left-back and right-back ; in midfield , left-half , centre-half and right-half ; and for the forward line there were outside-left ( or left wing ) , inside-left , centre-forward , inside-right and outside-right ( or right wing ) . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game ( though some old familiar ones remain ) . The term half-back fell out of use by the early 1970s and midfield was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield . The fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as rigidly defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills and physical attributes . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions are referred to as utility players . However , in Total Football tactics , the players are only loosely defined into a position",
  "/wiki/Forward_(association_football)": "Forwards are the players on a football ( soccer ) team who play nearest to the opposing team 's goal , and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals . Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players . Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards ; for example , the common 4-2-3-1 formation includes one forward . Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards , or none",

  "/wiki/Retirement": "Retirement is the withdrawal from one 's position or occupation or from one 's active working life . A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours . An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement , by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement . Some people who have retired from a position with a pre-nominal title , particularly military officers , are often listed with a post-nominal indicating retirement , e.g. , Admiral John Smith ( ret ) ( or rtd or retd ) . Many people choose to retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits , although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer ( by illness or accident ) or as a result of legislation concerning their position . In most countries , the idea of retirement is of recent origin , being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Previously , low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death . Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889 . Nowadays , most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age , funded by employers or the state . In many poorer countries there is no support for the old beyond that provided through the family . Today , retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies ; hard ideological , social , cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right . In many western countries , this is a right embodied in national constitutions",
