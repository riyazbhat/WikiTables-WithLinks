  "/wiki/Calvinist": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millennium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox .

[ n 3 ] The book became Christian Science 's central text , along with the Bible , and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies . Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ , Scientist , and in 1894 the Mother Church , The First Church of Christ , Scientist , was built in Boston , Massachusetts . Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States , with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936 , a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000 , and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000 . The church is known for its newspaper , The Christian Science Monitor , which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002 , and for its public Reading Rooms around the world . [ n 4 ] Eddy described Christian Science as a return to primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing . There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity . In particular , adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism , believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion . This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder , and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health . The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care - adherents use dentists , optometrists , obstetricians , physicians for broken bones , and vaccination when required by law - but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine . Between the 1880s and 1990s , the avoidance of medical treatment led to the deaths of several adherents and their children",

It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide .

Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy .

  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan",

  "/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism": "Orthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of contemporary Judaism . Theologically , it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah , both Written and Oral , as literally revealed by God on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since . Orthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law , or halakha , which is to be interpreted and determined only according to traditional methods and in adherence to the continuum of received precedent through the ages . It regards the entire halakhic system as ultimately grounded in immutable revelation , essentially beyond external and historical influence . More than any theoretical issue , obeying the dietary , purity , ethical , and other laws of halakha is the hallmark of Orthodoxy . Other key doctrines include belief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead , divine reward and punishment for the righteous and the sinners , the Election of Israel as a people bound by a covenant with God , and an eventual Messianic Age ruled by a salvific Messiah-King who will restore the Temple in Jerusalem . Orthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination . Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained , and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate . Very roughly , it may be divided between Haredi Judaism ( ultra-Orthodox ) , which is more conservative and reclusive , and Modern Orthodox Judaism , which is relatively open to outer society . Each of those is itself formed of independent streams . They are almost uniformly exclusionist , regarding Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism and rejecting all competing non-Orthodox philosophies as illegitimate .
