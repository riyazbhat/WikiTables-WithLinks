  "/wiki/Solitary_confinement": "Solitary confinement is a form of imprisonment distinguished by living in single cells with little or no meaningful contact to other inmates , strict measures to control contraband , and the use of additional security measures and equipment . It is specifically designed for disruptive inmates who are security risks to other inmates , the prison staff , or the prison itself . It is mostly employed for violations of discipline , such as murder , hostage-taking , deadly assault , and rioting . However , it is also used as a measure of protection for inmates whose safety is threatened by other inmates . Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in American English as the hotbox , the hole , AdSeg ( administrative segregation ) , the SHU ( pronounced shoe ) , an acronym for Special Housing Unit or Security Housing Unit ; in Australian English as the Slot or the Pound ; in British English as the block , The Segregation Unit , or the cooler . It has also been called prison 'segregation ' and 'restrictive housing . ' Solitary confinement has received severe criticism for having detrimental psychological effects and , to some and in some cases , constituting torture . According to a 2017 review study , a robust scientific literature has established the negative psychological effects of solitary confinement , leading to an emerging consensus among correctional as well as professional , mental health , legal , and human rights organizations to drastically limit the use of solitary confinement .",

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age . Gotti quickly became one of the crime family 's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family underboss Aniello Dellacroce , operating out of the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens . Early in his criminal career and following the FBI 's indictment of members of Gotti 's crew for selling narcotics , Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss Paul Castellano for selling drugs . As this fear continued to grow , and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family , Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter , leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America 's most powerful crime syndicate , and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from racketeering , hijacking , loan sharking , drug trafficking , bookmaking , prostitution , extortion , pornography , illegal gambling and other criminal activities . At his peak , Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States . During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style , which gained him favor with some of the general public . While his peers avoided attracting attention , especially from the media , Gotti became known as The Dapper Don , for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras . He was later given the nickname The Teflon Don after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his acquittal , though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by jury tampering , juror misconduct , and witness intimidation . Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall . According to Sammy Gravano , Gotti earned between $ 5-20 million per year during his tenure as Gambino boss . Gotti 's underboss Salvatore Sammy the Bull Gravano aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti .",
  "/wiki/Gambino_crime_family": "The Gambino crime family ( pronounced [ \u0261am\u02c8bi\u02d0no ] ) is one of the Five Families that dominate organized crime activities in New York City , United States , within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the American Mafia . The group , which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957 , is named after Carlo Gambino , boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963 , when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention . The group 's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California . Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering , gambling , loansharking , extortion , money laundering , prostitution , fraud , hijacking , and fencing . The family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the Castellammarese War of 1931 . For most of the next quarter-century , it was a minor player in organized crime . Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia , who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld 's enforcement arm , Murder , Inc . He remained in power even after Murder , Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s , and took over his family in 1951 - by all accounts , after murdering the family 's founder Vincent Mangano . The rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957 , when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan . Experts believe that Anastasia 's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family . Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba . The family 's fortunes grew through 1976 , when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law Paul Castellano as boss upon his death .",

  "/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking": "Aircraft hijacking ( also known as airplane hijacking , skyjacking , plane hijacking , plane jacking , air robbery , air piracy , or aircraft piracy , with the latter term being used within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ) , or simply hijacking , is the unlawful seizure of an aircraft by an individual or a group . Dating from the earliest of hijackings , most cases involve the pilot being forced to fly according to the hijacker 's demands . However , in rare cases , the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves and used them in suicide attacks ; most notably in the September 11 attacks , and in several cases , planes have been hijacked by the official pilot or co-pilot . Unlike carjacking or sea piracy , an aircraft hijacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft . Individuals driven by personal gain often divert planes to destinations where they are not planned to go . Some hijacking situations intend to use passengers or crew as hostages , either for monetary ransom or for some political or administrative concession by authorities . Various motives have driven such occurrences , such as demanding the release of certain high-profile individuals or for the right of political asylum ( notably Flight ET 961 ) . Hijackings involving hostages have produced violent confrontations between hijackers and the authorities , during negotiation and settlement . In the case of Lufthansa Flight 181 and Air France Flight 139 , the hijackers were not satisfied and showed no inclination to surrender , resulting in attempts by special forces to rescue passengers . In most jurisdictions of the world , aircraft hijacking is punishable by life imprisonment or a long prison sentence . In most jurisdictions where the death penalty is a legal punishment , aircraft hijacking is a capital crime , including in China , India , and the U.S. states of Georgia and Mississippi .",
