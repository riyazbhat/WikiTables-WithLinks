  "/wiki/Jackson_Lake": "Jackson Lake is in Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming . This natural lake was enlarged by the construction of the Jackson Lake Dam , which was originally built in 1911 , enlarged in 1916 and rebuilt by 1989 . As part of the Minidoka Project the top 33 ft ( 10 m ) of the lake is used by farmers in Idaho for irrigation purposes under water rights legislation that was enacted prior to the establishment of Grand Teton National Park . The lake is the remnant of large glacial gouging from the neighboring Teton Range to the west and the Yellowstone Plateau to the north . The lake is primarily fed by the Snake River , which flows in from the north , and empties at Jackson Lake Dam . Jackson Lake is one of the largest high altitude lakes in the United States , at an elevation of 6,772 ft ( 2,064 m ) above sea level . The lake is up to 15 mi ( 24 km ) long , 7 mi ( 11 km ) wide and 438 ft ( 134 m ) deep . The water of the lake averages below 60 \u00b0F ( 16 \u00b0C ) , even during the summer . Numerous species of fish inhabit the lake including nonnative brown and lake trout and the native Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and mountain whitefish . There are over 15 islands in the lake , including the largest , Elk Island , and Donoho Point . John D. Rockefeller , Jr. Memorial Parkway is located near the northern end of Jackson Lake and extends to the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park . This roadway combines with the roads in Grand Teton National Park that follow the eastern side of the lake , and provides access for boating and fishing .",

  "/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)": "The Green River , located in the western United States , is the chief tributary of the Colorado River .

The Green River is 730 miles ( 1,170 km ) long , beginning in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming and flowing through Wyoming and Utah for most of its course , except for 40 miles ( 64 km ) into western Colorado . Much of the route is through the Colorado Plateau and through some of the most spectacular canyons in the United States . It is only slightly smaller than the Colorado when the two rivers merge , but typically carries a larger load of silt . The average yearly mean flow of the river at Green River , Utah is 6,121 cubic feet ( 173.3 m3 ) per second . The status of the Green River as a tributary of the Colorado River came about for mainly political reasons . In earlier nomenclature , the Colorado River began at its confluence with the Green River . Above the confluence the Colorado was called the Grand River . In 1921 , Colorado U.S. Representative Edward T. Taylor petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River . On July 25 , 1921 , the name change was made official in House Joint Resolution 460 of the 66th Congress , over the objections of representatives from Wyoming and Utah and the United States Geological Survey which noted that the drainage basin of the Green River was more extensive than that of the Grand River , although the Grand carried a higher volume of water at its confluence with the Green .",
