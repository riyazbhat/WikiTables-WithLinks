  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97 % of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90 % of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8 % are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto )",
  "/wiki/Space_Invaders": "Space Invaders ( Japanese : \u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d9\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc , Hepburn : Sup\u0113su Inb\u0113d\u0101 ) is a 1978 arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado . It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan , and licensed in the United States by the Midway division of Bally . Within the shooter genre , Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre . The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible . Space Invaders was an immediate commercial success ; by 1982 , it had grossed $ 3.8 billion , with a net profit of $ 450 million , making it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product at the time . Adjusted for inflation , the many versions of the game are estimated to have grossed over $ 13 billion in total revenue as of 2016 , making it the highest-grossing video game of all time . Space Invaders is considered one of the most influential video games of all time . It helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry , and ushered in the golden age of arcade video games . It was the inspiration for numerous video games and game designers across different genres , and has been ported and re-released in various forms . The 1980 Atari VCS version quadrupled sales of the VCS , thereby becoming the first killer app for video game consoles . More broadly , the pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon , often representing video games as a whole . Designer Nishikado drew inspiration from games like 1976 's ball-bouncing game Breakout and the 1975 shooter game Gun Fight , as well as science fiction narratives such as The War of the Worlds , Space Battleship Yamato , and Star Wars",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8 % of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11 % of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation",
