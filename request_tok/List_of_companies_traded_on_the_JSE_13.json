  "/wiki/Banking": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit . Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets . Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country , banks are highly regulated in most countries . Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities . In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity , banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords . Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world . In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties - notably , the Medicis , the Fuggers , the Welsers , the Berenbergs , and the Rothschilds - have played a central role over many centuries . The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank .",

  "/wiki/Healthcare": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization .",

  "/wiki/Radio": "Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves . Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz ( Hz ) and 300 gigahertz ( GHz ) . They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves , and received by a radio receiver connected to another antenna . Radio is very widely used in modern technology , in radio communication , radar , radio navigation , remote control , remote sensing and other applications . In radio communication , used in radio and television broadcasting , cell phones , two-way radios , wireless networking and satellite communication among numerous other uses , radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver , by modulating the radio signal ( impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave ) in the transmitter . In radar , used to locate and track objects like aircraft , ships , spacecraft and missiles , a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object , and the reflected waves reveal the object 's location . In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR , a mobile receiver receives radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known , and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth . In wireless radio remote control devices like drones , garage door openers , and keyless entry systems , radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device . Applications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances , such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens , and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines , are not usually called radio . The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver . Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886 . The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi , and radio began to be used commercially around 1900 .",
  "/wiki/Film": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",
  "/wiki/Television": "Television ( TV ) , sometimes shortened to tele or telly , is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome ( black and white ) , or in colour , and in two or three dimensions and sound . The term can refer to a television set , a television program ( TV show ) , or the medium of television transmission . Television is a mass medium for advertising , entertainment and news . Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s , but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers . After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , especially the convenience of remote retrieval , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher . HDTV may be transmitted in various formats : 1080p , 1080i and 720p .",

  "/wiki/Automobile": "A car ( or automobile ) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation . Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads , seat one to eight people , have four tires , and mainly transport people rather than goods . Cars came into global use during the 20th century , and developed economies depend on them . The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen . Cars became widely available in the early 20th century . One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T , an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company . Cars were rapidly adopted in the US , where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts , but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world . [ citation needed ] Cars have controls for driving , parking , passenger comfort , and a variety of lights . Over the decades , additional features and controls have been added to vehicles , making them progressively more complex , but also more reliable and easier to operate . [ citation needed ] These include rear reversing cameras , air conditioning , navigation systems , and in-car entertainment . Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine , fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels . Electric cars , which were invented early in the history of the car , became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025 .",
  "/wiki/Wholesale": "Wholesaling or distributing is the sale of goods or merchandise to retailers ; to industrial , commercial , institutional or other professional business users ; or to other wholesalers ( wholesale businesses ) and related subordinated services . In general , it is the sale of goods to anyone other than a standard consumer . Wholesaling is the selling of merchandise to anyone either a person or an organization other than the end consumer of that merchandise . According to the United Nations Statistics Division , wholesale is the resale ( sale without transformation ) of new and used goods to retailers , to industrial , commercial , institutional or professional users , or to other wholesalers , or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for , or selling merchandise to , such persons or companies . Wholesalers frequently physically assemble , sort and grade goods in large lots , break bulk , repack and redistribute in smaller lots . While wholesalers of most products usually operate from independent premises , wholesale marketing for foodstuffs can take place at specific wholesale markets where all traders are congregated . Traditionally , wholesalers were closer to the markets they supplied than the source from which they got the products . However , with the advent of the internet and e-procurement there are an increasing number of wholesalers located nearer to the manufacturers in China , Taiwan , and Southeast Asia . In the banking industry wholesale usually refers to wholesale banking , providing tailored services to large customers , in contrast with retail banking , providing standardized services to large numbers of smaller customers .",

  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",

  "/wiki/Manufacture": "Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines , tools , chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry . The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design , in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale . Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products ( such as aircraft , household appliances , furniture , sports equipment or automobiles ) , or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers ( usually through wholesalers , who in turn sell to retailers , who then sell them to individual customers ) . Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product . The manufacturing process begins with the product design , and materials specification from which the product is made . These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part . Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product 's components . Some industries , such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead . The manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design . Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation , General Electric , Procter & Gamble , General Dynamics , Boeing , Pfizer , and Precision Castparts . Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group , Siemens , FCA and Michelin . Examples in Asia include Toyota , Yamaha , Panasonic , LG , Samsung and Tata Motors .",
  "/wiki/Furniture": "Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating ( e.g. , chairs , stools , and sofas ) , eating ( tables ) , and sleeping ( e.g. , beds ) . Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work ( as horizontal surfaces above the ground , such as tables and desks ) , or to store things ( e.g. , cupboards and shelves ) . Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art . In addition to furniture 's functional role , it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose . It can be made from many materials , including metal , plastic , and wood . Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture . People have been using natural objects , such as tree stumps , rocks and moss , as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation . Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago , people began constructing and carving their own furniture , using wood , stone , and animal bones . Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia , depicting the goddess on a throne . The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland , and includes cupboards , dressers and beds all constructed from stone . Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt . This era saw constructed wooden pieces , including stools and tables , sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory .",
