  "/wiki/Election_boycott": "An election boycott is the boycotting of an election by a group of voters , each of whom abstains from voting . Boycotting may be used as a form of political protest where voters feel that electoral fraud is likely , or that the electoral system is biased against its candidates , that the polity organizing the election lacks legitimacy , or that the candidates running are very unpopular . In jurisdictions with compulsory voting , a boycott may amount to an act of civil disobedience ; alternatively , supporters of the boycott may be able to cast blank votes or vote for none of the above . Boycotting voters may belong to a particular regional or ethnic group . A particular political party or candidate may refuse to run in the election and urges its supporters to boycott the vote . In the case of a referendum , a boycott may be used as a voting tactic by opponents of the proposition . If the referendum requires a minimum turnout to be valid , the boycott may prevent this quorum being reached . In general elections , individuals and parties will often boycott in order to protest the ruling party 's policies with the hope that when voters do not show up the elections will be deemed illegitimate by outside observers . This tactic , however , can prove disastrous for the boycotting parties . Lack of participation rarely nullifies election results and the distorted voting is likely to further detach boycotting groups from the organs of power , leaving them susceptible to political irrelevance",

Election took place in 272 constituencies , whilst a further 70 seats were awarded to parties having been reserved for women and minority groups ; none of the parties achieved the 172 seats needed for an overall majority . The Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) won the largest number of votes and seats but still fell six seats short ; this resulted in a hung parliament where no party was able to command a majority in the National Assembly . Initial results saw the hung parliament for a second consecutive general election - the first being the prior general election in 2008 . Potential for a hung parliament was widely considered and predicted as both countries ' politicians were better prepared for the constitutional process that would follow such a result , in contrast to 2008 . Speculations for the potential hung parliament were dismissed when the independent candidates joined the PML ( N ) which allowed that party to form a simple-majority government by bringing on-board nineteen independent candidates , thirteen more than the minimum required to form a government .
