  "/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting": "Instant-runoff voting ( IRV ) is a type of ranked preferential voting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates . Instead of indicating support for only one candidate , voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference . Ballots are initially counted for each voter 's top choice . If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices , that candidate wins . If not , then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated . The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice . This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes . When the field is reduced to two , it has become an instant runoff that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head . Compared to plurality voting , IRV can reduce the effect of vote-splitting when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters . Instant-runoff voting is used in national elections in several countries . For example , it is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives and at least one house of all Australian state parliaments ; the President of India and members of legislative councils in India ; the President of Ireland ; members of Congress in Maine in the United States ; and the Parliament in Papua New Guinea . The method is also used in local elections around the world , including New York City offices starting in 2021",

Founded as a mining camp during the Colorado Silver Boom and later named Aspen because of the abundance of aspen trees in the area , the city boomed during the 1880s , its first decade of existence . The boom ended when the Panic of 1893 led to a collapse in the silver market , and the city began a half-century known as the quiet years during which its population steadily declined , reaching a nadir of fewer than a thousand by 1930 . Aspen 's fortunes reversed in the mid-20th century when neighboring Aspen Mountain was developed into a ski resort , and industrialist Walter Paepcke bought many properties in the city in the 1950s and redeveloped them . Today it is home to three institutions , two of which Paepcke helped found , that have international importance : the Aspen Music Festival and School , the Aspen Institute , and the Aspen Center for Physics .

  "/wiki/Single_transferable_vote": "The single transferable vote ( STV ) is a proportional voting system designed to achieve or closely approach proportional representation through voters ranking candidates in multi-seat organizations or constituencies ( voting districts ) . There are various ways of counting votes under STV , as described below . Under STV , each elector ( voter ) gets a single vote in an election electing multiple winners . Each elector marks their ballot for the most preferred candidate and also marks back-up preferences . The vote goes to the voter 's first preference if possible , but if their first preference is eliminated , instead of being thrown away , the vote is transferred to a back-up preference , with the vote being assigned to the voter 's second , third , or lower choice or being apportioned fractionally to different candidates . The counting process works thus : votes are totalled , and a quota ( the minimum number of votes required to win a seat ) is derived . [ note 1 ] If the elector 's first-ranked candidate achieves the quota , the candidate is declared elected ; and , in some STV systems , any surplus vote is transferred to other candidates in proportion to the next back-up preference marked on the ballots . If more candidates than seats remain , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated , with the votes in their favour being transferred to other candidates as determined by the voters ' next back-up preference . These elections and eliminations , and vote transfers if applicable , continue until enough candidates exceed quota to fill all the seats or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are unfilled seats , at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected . The specific method of transferring votes varies in different systems ( see \u00a7 Counting methods ) . Advocates for STV say that it enables votes to be cast for individual candidates rather than for parties and party machine-controlled party lists , and - compared to first-past-the-post ( FPTP ) voting - reduces wasted votes ( votes being wasted on losers and surplus votes being wasted on sure winners ) by transferring them to other preferred candidates . STV also provides approximately proportional representation , even in non-partisan elections , ensuring that minority factions have some representation",

  "/wiki/Contingent_vote": "The contingent vote , also known as top-two IRV is an electoral system used to elect a single winner . It is a variation of instant-runoff voting ( IRV ) , in which the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference . Under the contingent vote , there is a first round in which a candidate requires a majority of first preference votes to win . If no candidate has a majority , then all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and there is a second count , where the votes of those who supported eliminated candidates are distributed among the two remaining candidates . This ensures that one candidate achieves a majority . The contingent vote differs from IRV which allows for many rounds of counting , eliminating only one weakest candidate each round . The contingent vote can also be considered a compressed form of the two-round system ( runoff system ) , in which both 'rounds ' occur without the need for voters to go to the polls twice . Today , a special variant of the contingent vote is used to elect the President of Sri Lanka . Another variant , called the supplementary vote , is used to pick directly elected mayors and police and crime commissioners in England . In the past the ordinary form of the contingent vote was used to elect the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1892 to 1942 . To date , this has been the longest continuous use of the system anywhere in the world . It was also used in the US state of Alabama in the 1920s",
