Blyton 's books are still enormously popular , and have been translated into 90 languages . She wrote on a wide range of topics including education , natural history , fantasy , mystery , and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy , Famous Five and Secret Seven series . Her first book , Child Whispers , a 24-page collection of poems , was published in 1922 . Following the commercial success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair ( 1937 ) and The Enchanted Wood ( 1939 ) , Blyton went on to build a literary empire , sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions . Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind : she typed her stories as events unfolded before her . The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers , a charge she vigorously denied . Blyton 's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics , teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards , because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books , particularly the Noddy series . Some libraries and schools banned her works , which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit . Her books have been criticised as being elitist , sexist , racist , xenophobic and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain , but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968 . Blyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework , so she encouraged them to support worthy causes . In particular , through the clubs she set up or supported , she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities .",
