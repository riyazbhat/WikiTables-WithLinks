It is situated in fare zone 1 and has two separate tube stations providing connections to the Bakerloo , Circle , District , and Hammersmith & City lines . The station has been perennially popular for passengers and goods , particularly milk and parcels . Major upgrades took place in the 1870s , the 1910s and the 1960s , each trying to add additional platforms and space while trying to preserve the existing services and architecture as much as possible . Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863 , as the original western terminus of the Metropolitan Railway , the world 's first underground railway . In the 20th century , suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the urban sprawl of London moved westwards . Despite the numerous upgrades and rebuilding , plus damage sustained in particular during World War II , Brunel 's original design is still recognisable .",

The station was constructed by the Midland Railway ( MR ) , which had an extensive network across the Midlands and the North of England , but no dedicated line into London . After rail traffic problems following the 1862 International Exhibition , the MR decided to build a connection from Bedford to London with their own terminus . The station was designed by William Henry Barlow and constructed with a single-span iron roof . Following the station 's opening on 1 October 1868 , the MR constructed the Midland Grand Hotel on the station 's fa\u00e7ade , which has been widely praised for its architecture and is now a Grade I listed building along with the rest of the station . By the 1960s , St Pancras was surplus to requirements and services were diverted to King 's Cross and Euston but there was fierce opposition to its proposed closure and demolition of the station and hotel . The station was reinvented in the late 20th century as the terminal for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in an urban regeneration plan across East London . The complex underwent an \u00a3800 million refurbishment which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2007 .

Southend was London 's third-busiest airport from the 1960s until the end of the 1970s , when it was overtaken in passenger numbers by London Stansted Airport . Following its purchase by Stobart Group in 2008 , a development programme provided a new terminal and control tower , extended runway , and connection to central London via a regular rail service running between Liverpool Street Station and Southend Airport Station on the Shenfield-Southend line , continuing on to Southend Victoria . EasyJet began operating services by opening a base at Southend in April 2012 and Irish carrier Aer Lingus Regional began regular flights to Dublin in May , resulting in a rapid increase in airport passenger numbers during 2012 , with 721,661 using the airport in that year , 969,912 in 2013 and 1,102,358 in 2014 . The following year saw a decline to 900,648 and again to 874,549 in 2016 , while 2017 saw passenger numbers increase more than 25% to 1,095,914 .

From the mid-1960s , executive aircraft have been based at the airport . During the late 1970s , an expansion plan was initiated at Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year , although the airport experienced a reduction in passenger numbers in the 1980s . In 1990 , the airport was renamed London Luton Airport to re-emphasise the airport 's proximity to the capital . The arrival of new operators at Luton during 1990s , such as charter operator MyTravel Group and new low-cost scheduled flights from Debonair and EasyJet , contributed to a rapid increase in passenger numbers that made it the fastest growing major airport in the UK . In August 1997 , to fund an \u00a380 million extension of the airport , a 30-year concession contract was issued to a public-private partnership consortium , London Luton Airport Operations Limited . Throughout the 1990s , \u00a330 million was invested in Luton 's infrastructure and facilities . In November 1999 , a new \u00a340 million terminal was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip ; the new building houses 60 check-in desks , baggage and flight information systems and a range of commercial outlets ."
