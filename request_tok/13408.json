  "/wiki/Carrotblanca": "Carrotblanca is a 1995 8-minute Looney Tunes cartoon . It was originally shown in theaters alongside The Amazing Panda Adventure ( in North America ) and The Pebble and the Penguin ( internationally ) . It was subsequently released on video packaged with older Looney Tunes cartoons and was included in the special edition DVD , and later HD DVD and Blu-ray , releases of Casablanca , the film to which it is both a parody and an homage . At the time of release , WB did not own the rights to Casablanca ( such rights were with Turner Entertainment - they still technically hold the film today , but WB became responsible for distribution a year after the short 's release as a result of their parent company 's purchase of Turner in 1996 ) . Unlike the previous modern Looney Tunes shorts , this short was not made by the Greg Ford/Terry Lennon team nor Chuck Jones Film Productions . It was produced by the Animaniacs writing team at Warner Bros . Feature Animation . Carrotblanca was the only Looney Tunes short produced by that group of writers and the Feature Animation division . The short involves nearly all the major Looney Tunes characters in roles from the film , including Bugs Bunny as Rick , Daffy Duck as Sam and Pep\u00e9 Le Pew as Captain Renault . Some characters use their real names , others the names of the characters in the original film , or parodic versions . Several minor Looney Tunes characters can be seen in the background ( such as Pete Puma as a waiter wearing a kaftan and fez , and Giovanni Jones and The Crusher as the maitre d ' and doorman ) .",
  "/wiki/Casablanca_(film)": "Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison 's unproduced stage play Everybody Comes to Rick 's . The film stars Humphrey Bogart , Ingrid Bergman , and Paul Henreid ; it also features Claude Rains , Conrad Veidt , Sydney Greenstreet , Peter Lorre , and Dooley Wilson . Set during World War II , it focuses on an American expatriate who must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her husband , a Czech resistance leader , escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Germans . Warner Bros. story editor Irene Diamond convinced producer Hal B. Wallis to purchase the film rights to the play in January 1942 . Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script . However , despite studio resistance , they left to work on Frank Capra 's Why We Fight series early in 1942 . Howard Koch was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later . Principal photography began on May 25 , 1942 , ending on August 3 ; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank , California with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys , Los Angeles . Although Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers , no one involved with its production expected it to be anything other than one of the hundreds of ordinary pictures produced by Hollywood that year . Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier . It had its world premiere on November 26 , 1942 , in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23 , 1943 . The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run .",
