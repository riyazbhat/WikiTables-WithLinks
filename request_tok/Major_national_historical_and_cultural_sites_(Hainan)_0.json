It followed the Song dynasty and preceded the Ming dynasty . Although the Mongols had ruled territories including modern-day North China for decades , it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style , and the conquest was not complete until 1279 when the Southern Song dynasty was defeated in the Battle of Yamen . His realm was , by this point , isolated from the other Mongol khanates and controlled most of modern-day China and its surrounding areas , including modern Mongolia . It was the first non-Han Chinese dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Yuan forces . Following that , the rebuked Genghisid rulers retreated to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule as the Northern Yuan dynasty . Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language , while others only used their native language ( i.e . Mongolian ) and the 'Phags-pa script .

Yet , even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century , it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people .

  "/wiki/Han_dynasty": "The Han dynasty ( Chinese : \u6f22\u671d ; pinyin : H\u00e0nch\u00e1o ) was the second imperial dynasty of China ( 206 BC-220 AD ) , preceded by the Qin dynasty ( 221-206 BC ) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period ( 220-280 AD ) . Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han Chinese ( Han Zu ) and the Chinese script is referred to as Han characters . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9-23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC - 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25-220 AD ) . The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( r. 141-87 BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu . This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 AD . The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty ( c. 1050-256 BC )",
  "/wiki/Sansha": "Sansha is a prefecture-level city of Hainan province of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) . It is located on Woody Island and administers ( actually or nominally ) several island groups and undersea atolls in the South China Sea including the Spratly Islands , the Paracel Islands , Macclesfield Bank , Scarborough Shoal , and a number of other ungrouped maritime features . The entire territory is disputed , and the PRC 's de facto control over the area varies . Foreign reaction to the declaration was not positive . The United States Department of State called the change in the administrative status of the territory unilateral , and the move has received criticism from nations engaged in the South China Sea dispute , particularly the Philippines and Vietnam . Sansha has equal administrative status to a prefecture-level city , and was created on 24 July 2012 . Reports in 2012 in the China daily stated that the establishment of Sansha was simply an upgrade of the administrative status of these island groups from the previous county-level Administrative Office , . Subsequent developments have turned Sansha city ( located on Woody island ) into a small town with a small non commercial airport and a small harbor with two sets of breakwaters . Sansha administers a group of 260 islands , reefs and beaches located in the Spratlys ( Nansha ) , Paracel , Xisha islands and Zhongsha islands ( Macclesfield bank )",
