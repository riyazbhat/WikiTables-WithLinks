  "/wiki/Lieutenant_general": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . [ citation needed ] However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use . In Latvia , Lithuania and Singapore , the chief of defence is a lieutenant general , and in the Irish Defence Forces and Israel Defense Forces , the Chief of Staff holds this rank .",

Vietnam shares its land borders with China to the north , and Laos and Cambodia to the west . It shares its maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand , and the Philippines , Indonesia and Malaysia through the South China Sea . [ n 5 ] Its capital city is Hanoi , while its most populous city is Ho Chi Minh City , also known by its former name of Saigon . Archaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age . The ancient Vietnamese nation was annexed by China in the 2nd century BC , which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium . The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD . This paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded geographically southward until the Indochinese Peninsula saw French colonisation in the mid-19th century . Modern Vietnam was born upon the Proclamation of Independence from France in 1945 . Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the First Indochina War , which ended in 1954 , the nation was divided into two rival states : communist North and anti-communist South . Conflicts intensified in the Vietnam War , which saw extensive US intervention in support of South Vietnam and ended with North Vietnamese victory in 1975 .",
  "/wiki/Foreign_policy": "A country 's foreign policy , also called foreign relations or foreign affairs policy , consists of self-interest strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its national interests and to achieve goals within its international relations milieu . The approaches are strategically employed to interact with other countries . The study of such strategies is called foreign policy analysis . In recent decades , due to the deepening level of globalization and transnational activities , states also must interact with non-state actors . These interactions evaluated and monitored in seeking the benefits of bilateral and multilateral international cooperation . Since the national interests are paramount , governments design their foreign policies through high-level decision-making processes . National interests may be accomplished as a result of peaceful cooperation with other nations , or through exploitation . Usually , creating foreign policy is the job of the head of government and the foreign minister ( or equivalent ) . In some countries , the legislature also has considerable effects . Foreign policies of countries have varying rates of change and scopes of intent , which can be affected by factors that change the perceived national interests or even affect the stability of the country itself . The foreign policy of a country can have a profound and lasting impact on other countries and on the course of international relations as a whole , such as the Monroe Doctrine conflicting with the mercantilism policies of 19th-century European countries and the goals of independence of newly formed Central American and South American countries .",
