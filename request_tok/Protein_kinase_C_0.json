  "/wiki/Ligands": "In coordination chemistry , a ligand [ help 1 ] is an ion or molecule ( functional group ) that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex . The bonding with the metal generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand 's electron pairs . The nature of metal-ligand bonding can range from covalent to ionic . Furthermore , the metal-ligand bond order can range from one to three . Ligands are viewed as Lewis bases , although rare cases are known to involve Lewis acidic ligands . Metals and metalloids are bound to ligands in virtually all circumstances , although gaseous naked metal ions can be generated in a high vacuum . Ligands in a complex dictate the reactivity of the central atom , including ligand substitution rates , the reactivity of the ligands themselves , and redox . Ligand selection is a critical consideration in many practical areas , including bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry , homogeneous catalysis , and environmental chemistry . Ligands are classified in many ways , including : charge , size ( bulk ) , the identity of the coordinating atom ( s ) , and the number of electrons donated to the metal ( denticity or hapticity ) . The size of a ligand is indicated by its cone angle",

This family is also commonly called the Gq/11 ( Gq/G11 ) family or Gq/11/14/15 family to include closely related family members . G alpha subunits may be referred to as Gq alpha , G\u03b1q , or Gq\u03b1 . Gq proteins couple to G protein-coupled receptors to activate beta-type phospholipase C ( PLC-\u03b2 ) enzymes . PLC-\u03b2 in turn hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) to diacyl glycerol ( DAG ) and inositol trisphosphate ( IP3 ) . IP3 acts as a second messenger to release stored calcium into the cytoplasm , while DAG acts as a second messenger that activates protein kinase C ( PKC )",
  "/wiki/G-protein_coupled_receptor": "G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , also known as seven- ( pass ) -transmembrane domain receptors , 7TM receptors , heptahelical receptors , serpentine receptor , and G protein-linked receptors ( GPLR ) , constitute a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways and , ultimately , cellular responses . Coupling with G proteins , they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times . G protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes , including yeast , choanoflagellates , and animals . The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds , odors , pheromones , hormones , and neurotransmitters , and vary in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins . G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases . There are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-coupled receptors :",

  "/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract": "The gastrointestinal tract ( digestive tract , alimentary canal , digestion tract , GI tract , GIT ) is an organ system within humans and other animals which takes in food , digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients , and expels the remaining waste as feces . The mouth , esophagus , stomach and intestines are part of the gastrointestinal tract . Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines . A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs . All bilaterians have a gastrointestinal tract , also called a gut or an alimentary canal . This is a tube that transfers food to the organs of digestion . In large bilaterians , the gastrointestinal tract also has an exit , the anus , by which the animal disposes of feces ( solid wastes ) . Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means ( for example , through the mouth ) . The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus , stomach , and intestines , and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts . The GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus , forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion , namely , the stomach , small intestine , and large intestine . However , the complete human digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion ( the tongue , salivary glands , pancreas , liver and gallbladder ) . The tract may also be divided into foregut , midgut , and hindgut , reflecting the embryological origin of each segment",

Sphincters relax at death , often releasing fluids and feces",
  "/wiki/Digestive_system": "The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion ( the tongue , salivary glands , pancreas , liver , and gallbladder ) . Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components , until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body . The process of digestion has three stages . The first stage is the cephalic phase of digestion which begins with gastric secretions in response to the sight and smell of food . This stage includes the mechanical breakdown of food by chewing , and the chemical breakdown by digestive enzymes , that takes place in the mouth . Saliva contains digestive enzymes called amylase , and lingual lipase , secreted by the salivary glands and serous glands on the tongue . The enzymes start to break down the food in the mouth . Chewing , in which the food is mixed with saliva , begins the mechanical process of digestion . This produces a bolus which can be swallowed down the esophagus to enter the stomach . In the stomach the gastric phase of digestion takes place . The food is further broken down by mixing with gastric acid until it passes into the duodenum , in the third intestinal phase of digestion , where it is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas . Digestion is helped by the chewing of food carried out by the muscles of mastication , the tongue , and the teeth , and also by the contractions of peristalsis , and segmentation",

  "/wiki/Urethral_sphincter": "The urethral sphincters are two muscles used to control the exit of urine in the urinary bladder through the urethra . The two muscles are either the male or female external urethral sphincter and the internal urethral sphincter . When either of these muscles contracts , the urethra is sealed shut . The external urethral sphincter originates at the ischiopubic ramus and inserts into the intermeshing muscle fibers from the other side . It is controlled by the deep perineal branch of the pudendal nerve . Activity in the nerve fibers constricts the urethra",
  "/wiki/Urinary_system": "The urinary system , also known as the renal system or urinary tract , consists of the kidneys , ureters , bladder , and the urethra . The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body , regulate blood volume and blood pressure , control levels of electrolytes and metabolites , and regulate blood pH . The urinary tract is the body 's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine . The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein . Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons . Following filtration of blood and further processing , wastes ( in the form of urine ) exit the kidney via the ureters , tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder , where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination ( voiding ) . The female and male urinary system are very similar , differing only in the length of the urethra . Urine is formed in the kidneys through a filtration of blood . The urine is then passed through the ureters to the bladder , where it is stored . During urination , the urine is passed from the bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body . 800-2,000 milliliters ( mL ) of urine are normally produced every day in a healthy human . This amount varies according to fluid intake and kidney function",
  "/wiki/Uterus": "The uterus ( from Latin uterus , plural uteri ) or womb ( /wu\u02d0m/ ) is a major female hormone-responsive secondary sex organ of the reproductive system in humans and most other mammals . In the human , the lower end of the uterus , the cervix , opens into the vagina , while the upper end , the fundus , is connected to the fallopian tubes . It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation . In the human embryo , the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus .

The contraction of the muscle is then involuntary-stresses such as cold , fear etc . may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system , and thus cause contraction . Contraction of the muscles has a number of different purposes . Its principal function in the majority of mammals is to provide insulation : air becomes trapped between the erect hairs , helping the animal retain heat .

  "/wiki/Acetylcholine": "Acetylcholine ( ACh ) is an organic chemical that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals ( and humans ) as a neurotransmitter - a chemical message released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells , such as neurons , muscle cells and gland cells . Its name is derived from its chemical structure : it is an ester of acetic acid and choline . Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic . Substances that interfere with acetylcholine activity are called anticholinergics . Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction - in other words , it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles . This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions . Acetylcholine is also a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system , both as an internal transmitter for the sympathetic nervous system and as the final product released by the parasympathetic nervous system . Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous systems . In the brain , acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator . The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas , each with distinct functions ; such as playing an important role in arousal , attention , memory and motivation . Acetylcholine ( ACh ) , has also been traced in cells of non-neural origins and microbes . Recently , enzymes related to its synthesis , degradation and cellular uptake have been traced back to early origins of unicellular eukaryotes",

  "/wiki/Circulatory_system": "The circulatory system , also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system , is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients ( such as amino acids and electrolytes ) , oxygen , carbon dioxide , hormones , and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases , stabilize temperature and pH , and maintain homeostasis . The circulatory system includes the lymphatic system , which circulates lymph . The passage of lymph takes much longer than that of blood . Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma , red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system , carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues . Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid ( between cells ) and returned to the lymphatic system . The cardiovascular ( from Latin words meaning heart and vessel ) system comprises the blood , heart , and blood vessels . The lymph , lymph nodes , and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system , which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid ( between cells ) as lymph . The circulatory system of the blood is seen as having two components , a systemic circulation and a pulmonary circulation . While humans , as well as other vertebrates , have a closed cardiovascular system ( meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries , veins and capillaries ) , some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system . The lymphatic system , on the other hand , is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood . The more primitive , diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems . Many diseases affect the circulatory system",
  "/wiki/5-HT": "Serotonin ( /\u02ccs\u025br\u0259\u02c8to\u028an\u026an , \u02ccs\u026a\u0259r\u0259-/ ) or 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) is a monoamine neurotransmitter . It has a popular image as a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness , though its actual biological function is complex and multifaceted , modulating cognition , reward , learning , memory , and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction . Biochemically , the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan , via the ( rate-limiting ) hydroxylation of the 5 position on the ring ( forming the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan ) , and then decarboxylation to produce serotonin . Serotonin is primarily found in the enteric nervous system located in the gastrointestinal tract ( GI tract ) . However , it is also produced in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , specifically in the Raphe nuclei located in the brainstem . Additionally , serotonin is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction , where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets . Approximately 90 % of the human body 's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract , where it regulates intestinal movements . The serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally , which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation , which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility . The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS , where it has various functions . These include the regulation of mood , appetite , and sleep . Serotonin also has some cognitive functions , including memory and learning . Several classes of antidepressants , such as the SSRIs and the SNRIs among others , interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal , therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses",
  "/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor": "The mammalian 5-HT2A receptor is a subtype of the 5-HT2 receptor that belongs to the serotonin receptor family and is a G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) . 5-HT is short for 5-hydroxy-tryptamine , which is serotonin . This is the main excitatory receptor subtype among the GPCRs for serotonin , although 5-HT2A may also have an inhibitory effect on certain areas such as the visual cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex . This receptor was first noted for its importance as a target of serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as LSD . Later it came back to prominence because it was also found to be mediating , at least partly , the action of many antipsychotic drugs , especially the atypical ones . 5-HT2A may be a necessary receptor for the spread of the human polyoma virus called the JC virus . Downregulation of post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptor is an adaptive process provoked by chronic administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and classical antipsychotics . Suicidal and otherwise depressed patients have had more 5-HT2A receptors than normal patients . These findings suggest that post-synaptic 5-HT2A overdensity is involved in the pathogenesis of depression . Paradoxical down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors can be observed with several 5-HT2A antagonists . Thus , instead of tolerance , reverse-tolerance would be expected from 5-HT2A antagonists . However , there is at least one antagonist at this site which has been shown to up-regulate 5-HT2A receptors",
  "/wiki/Vasoconstriction": "Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels , in particular the large arteries and small arterioles . The process is the opposite of vasodilation , the widening of blood vessels . The process is particularly important in controlling hemorrhage and reducing acute blood loss . When blood vessels constrict , the flow of blood is restricted or decreased , thus retaining body heat or increasing vascular resistance . This makes the skin turn paler because less blood reaches the surface , reducing the radiation of heat . On a larger level , vasoconstriction is one mechanism by which the body regulates and maintains mean arterial pressure . Medications causing vasoconstriction , also known as vasoconstrictors , are one type of medicine used to raise blood pressure . Generalized vasoconstriction usually results in an increase in systemic blood pressure , but it may also occur in specific tissues , causing a localized reduction in blood flow . The extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance . Many vasoconstrictors also cause pupil dilation . Medications that cause vasoconstriction include : antihistamines , decongestants , and stimulants . Severe vasoconstriction may result in symptoms of intermittent claudication",

The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly , depending on the size of the organism , the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history . In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs . Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles , but atria in birds . These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply , thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood . These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways , or hollow tubes , of which the largest is the trachea , which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi . These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes , the bronchioles . In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi . It is the bronchioles , or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds . Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration .

For every ATP molecule that the pump uses , three sodium ions are exported and two potassium ions are imported ; there is hence a net export of a single positive charge per pump cycle . The sodium-potassium pump was discovered in 1957 by the Danish scientist Jens Christian Skou , who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1997 . Its discovery marked an important step forward in the understanding of how ions get into and out of cells , and it has particular significance for excitable cells such as nerve cells , which depend on this pump to respond to stimuli and transmit impulses . All mammals have four different sodium pump sub-types , or isoforms . Each has unique properties and tissue expression patterns",
  "/wiki/Neurons": "A neuron , neurone ( old British spelling ) or nerve cell , is an electrically excitable cell that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses . It is the main component of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoa . Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells . Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function . Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch , sound , or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs , and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain . Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output . Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord . A group of connected neurons is called a neural circuit . A typical neuron consists of a cell body ( soma ) , dendrites , and a single axon . The soma is usually compact . The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it . Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma",
  "/wiki/Autonomic_ganglia": "An autonomic ganglion is a cluster of nerve cell bodies ( a ganglion ) in the autonomic nervous system . The two types are sympathetic ganglion and parasympathetic ganglion",
  "/wiki/Nervous_system": "The nervous system is a highly complex part of an animal that coordinates its actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body . The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state",
  "/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential": "In neuroscience , an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) is a postsynaptic potential that makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential . This temporary depolarization of postsynaptic membrane potential , caused by the flow of positively charged ions into the postsynaptic cell , is a result of opening ligand-gated ion channels . These are the opposite of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , which usually result from the flow of negative ions into the cell or positive ions out of the cell . EPSPs can also result from a decrease in outgoing positive charges , while IPSPs are sometimes caused by an increase in positive charge outflow . The flow of ions that causes an EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic current ( EPSC ) . EPSPs , like IPSPs , are graded ( i.e . they have an additive effect ) . When multiple EPSPs occur on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane , their combined effect is the sum of the individual EPSPs . Larger EPSPs result in greater membrane depolarization and thus increase the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell reaches the threshold for firing an action potential",
  "/wiki/Central_nervous_system": "The central nervous system ( CNS ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord . The CNS is so named because it integrates the received information and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals - i.e. , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish - and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges . Within the CNS , the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglia or glia from the Greek for glue",
  "/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)": "In neuroscience , glutamate refers to the anion of glutamic acid in its role as a neurotransmitter : a chemical that nerve cells use to send signals to other cells . It is by a wide margin the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system . It is used by every major excitatory function in the vertebrate brain , accounting in total for well over 90 % of the synaptic connections in the human brain . It also serves as the primary neurotransmitter for some localized brain regions , such as cerebellum granule cells . Biochemical receptors for glutamate fall into three major classes , known as AMPA receptors , NMDA receptors , and metabotropic glutamate receptors . A fourth class , known as kainate receptors , are similar in many respects to AMPA receptors , but much less abundant . Many synapses use multiple types of glutamate receptors . AMPA receptors are ionotropic receptors specialized for fast excitation : in many synapses they produce excitatory electrical responses in their targets a fraction of a millisecond after being stimulated . NMDA receptors are also ionotropic , but they differ from AMPA receptors in being permeable , when activated , to calcium . Their properties make them particularly important for learning and memory . Metabotropic receptors act through second messenger systems to create slow , sustained effects on their targets . Because of its role in synaptic plasticity , glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain",
  "/wiki/NMDA_receptor": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( also known as the NMDA receptor or NMDAR ) , is a glutamate receptor and ion channel protein found in nerve cells . The NMDA receptor is one of three types of ionotropic glutamate receptors . The other receptors are the AMPA and kainate receptors . It is activated when glutamate and glycine ( or D-serine ) bind to it , and when activated it allows positively charged ions to flow through the cell membrane . The NMDA receptor is very important for controlling synaptic plasticity and memory function . The NMDAR is a specific type of ionotropic glutamate receptor . The NMDA receptor is so named because the agonist molecule N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) binds selectively to it , and not to other glutamate receptors . Activation of NMDA receptors results in the opening of an ion channel that is nonselective to cations , with a combined reversal potential near 0 mV . While the opening and closing of the ion channel is primarily gated by ligand binding , the current flow through the ion channel is voltage dependent . Extracellular magnesium ( Mg2+ ) and zinc ( Zn2+ ) ions can bind to specific sites on the receptor , blocking the passage of other cations through the open ion channel . Depolarization of the cell dislodges and repels the Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions from the pore , thus allowing a voltage-dependent flow of sodium ( Na+ ) and small amounts of calcium ( Ca2+ ) ions into the cell and potassium ( K+ ) out of the cell . Ca2+ flux through NMDARs is thought to be critical in synaptic plasticity , a cellular mechanism for learning and memory",
  "/wiki/Platelet": "Platelets , also called thrombocytes ( from Greek \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 , clot and \u03ba\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , cell ) , are a component of blood whose function ( along with the coagulation factors ) is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping , thereby initiating a blood clot . Platelets have no cell nucleus : they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow , which then enter the circulation . Circulating unactivated platelets are biconvex discoid ( lens-shaped ) structures , :117-18 2-3 \u00b5m in greatest diameter . Activated platelets have cell membrane projections covering their surface . Platelets are found only in mammals , whereas in other vertebrates ( e.g . birds , amphibians ) thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells . :3",

HTR2C denotes the human gene encoding for the receptor , that in humans is located at the X chromosome . As males have one copy of the gene and in females one of the two copies of the gene is repressed , polymorphisms at this receptor can affect the two sexes to differing extent",
  "/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid": "Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) is a clear , colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord . It is produced by specialised ependymal cells in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain , and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations . There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time , and about 500 mL is generated every day . CSF acts as a cushion or buffer , providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull . CSF also serves a vital function in the cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow . CSF occupies the subarachnoid space ( between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater ) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord . It fills the ventricles of the brain , cisterns , and sulci , as well as the central canal of the spinal cord . There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid . The ependymal cells of the choroid plexuses have multiple motile cilia on their apical surfaces that beat to move the CSF through the ventricles . A sample of CSF can be taken via lumbar puncture . This can reveal the intracranial pressure , as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges . Although noted by Hippocrates , it was only in the 18th century that Emanuel Swedenborg was credited with its rediscovery , and as late as 1914 Harvey Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus",
  "/wiki/Heart_muscle": "Cardiac muscle ( also called heart muscle or myocardium ) is one of three types of vertebrate muscles , with the other two being skeletal and smooth muscles . It is an involuntary , striated muscle that constitutes the main tissue of the walls of the heart . The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer layer of the heart wall ( the epicardium ) and the inner layer ( the endocardium ) , with blood supplied via the coronary circulation . It is composed of individual heart muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ) joined together by intercalated discs , encased by collagen fibers and other substances that form the extracellular matrix . Cardiac muscle contracts in a similar manner to skeletal muscle , although with some important differences . Electrical stimulation in the form of an action potential triggers the release of calcium from the cell 's internal calcium store , the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The rise in calcium causes the cell 's myofilaments to slide past each other in a process called excitation contraction coupling . Diseases of the heart muscle are of major importance . These include conditions caused by a restricted blood supply to the muscle including angina pectoris and myocardial infarction , and other heart muscle diseases known as cardiomyopathies",

  "/wiki/Potassium": "Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K ( from Neo-Latin kalium ) and atomic number 19 . Potassium is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force . Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure . It was first isolated from potash , the ashes of plants , from which its name derives . In the periodic table , potassium is one of the alkali metals , all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell , that is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge - a cation , that combines with anions to form salts . Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts . Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water , generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction , and burning with a lilac-colored flame . It is found dissolved in sea water ( which is 0.04 % potassium by weight ) , and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase , a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks . Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium , the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table . They have a similar first ionization energy , which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron . It was suspected in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts , and was proven in 1807 using electrolysis . Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes , of which 40K is radioactive",
  "/wiki/Lacrimal_gland": "In human physiology , the lacrimal glands are paired , almond-shaped exocrine glands , one for each eye , that secrete the aqueous layer of the tear film . They are situated in the upper lateral region of each orbit , in the lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal bone . Inflammation of the lacrimal glands is called dacryoadenitis . The lacrimal gland produces tears which then flow into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac . From that sac , the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose . Anatomists divide the gland into two sections , a palpebral lobe , or portion , and an orbital lobe or portion . The smaller palpebral lobe lies close to the eye , along the inner surface of the eyelid ; if the upper eyelid is everted , the palpebral portion can be seen . The orbital lobe of the gland , contains fine interlobular ducts that connect the orbital lobe and the palpebral lobe . They unite to form three to five main secretory ducts , joining five to seven ducts in the palpebral portion before the secreted fluid may enter on the surface of the eye . Tears secreted collect in the fornix conjunctiva of the upper lid , and pass over the eye surface to the lacrimal puncta , small holes found at the inner corner of the eyelids . These pass the tears through the lacrimal canaliculi on to the lacrimal sac , in turn to the nasolacrimal duct , which dumps them out into the nose .

  "/wiki/Endocrine_system": "The endocrine system is a chemical messenger system comprising feedback loops of the hormones released by internal glands of an organism directly into the circulatory system , regulating distant target organs . In humans , the major endocrine glands are the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands . In vertebrates , the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems . The study of the endocrine system and its disorders is known as endocrinology . Endocrinology is a branch of internal medicine . A number of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually referred to as an axis , for example , the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis . In addition to the specialized endocrine organs mentioned above , many other organs that are part of other body systems , including bone , kidney , liver , heart and gonads , have secondary endocrine functions . For example , the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such as erythropoietin and renin . Hormones can consist of either amino acid complexes , steroids , eicosanoids , leukotrienes , or prostaglandins . The endocrine system can be contrasted to both exocrine glands , which secrete hormones to the outside of the body using ducts and paracrine signalling between cells over a relatively short distance . Endocrine glands have no ducts , are vascular and commonly have intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones . In contrast , exocrine glands , such as salivary glands , sweat glands , and glands within the gastrointestinal tract , tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen",

  "/wiki/Gluconeogenesis": "Gluconeogenesis ( GNG ) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates . From breakdown of proteins , these substrates include glucogenic amino acids ( although not ketogenic amino acids ) ; from breakdown of lipids ( such as triglycerides ) , they include glycerol , odd-chain fatty acids ( although not even-chain fatty acids , see below ) ; and from other steps in metabolism they include pyruvate and lactate . Gluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels , avoiding low levels ( hypoglycemia ) . Other means include the degradation of glycogen ( glycogenolysis ) and fatty acid catabolism . Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process , present in plants , animals , fungi , bacteria , and other microorganisms . In vertebrates , gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and , to a lesser extent , in the cortex of the kidneys . In ruminants , this tends to be a continuous process . In many other animals , the process occurs during periods of fasting , starvation , low-carbohydrate diets , or intense exercise . The process is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP , effectively making the process exergonic . For example , the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously . Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis . Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes , such as the antidiabetic drug , metformin , which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells",

They contain an extensive secretory network ( called canaliculi ) from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach . The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase ( H+/K+ ATPase ) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H+ against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1 , [ citation needed ] which is the steepest [ citation needed ] ion gradient formed in the human body .

  "/wiki/Gastric_acid": "Gastric acid , gastric juice , or sometimes known as stomach acid , is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach membrane and is composed of hydrochloric acid , potassium chloride , and sodium chloride . The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins , by activating digestive enzymes , and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids . Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach , which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed . Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach . The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract . The main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells ( also called oxyntic cells ) in the gastric glands in the stomach . Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process . Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network ( called canaliculi ) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach . The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5 in the human stomach lumen , the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase . The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process , which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood , known as an alkaline tide . The highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure ( or denature )"
