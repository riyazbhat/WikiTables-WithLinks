  "/wiki/United_States_Navy": "The United States Navy ( USN ) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the eight uniformed services of the United States . It is the largest and most capable navy in the world and it has been estimated that in terms of tonnage of its active battle fleet alone , it is larger than the next 13 navies combined , which includes 11 U.S. allies or partner nations . It has the highest combined battle fleet tonnage and the world 's largest aircraft carrier fleet , with eleven in service , two new carriers under construction , and five other carriers planned . With 336,978 personnel on active duty and 101,583 in the Ready Reserve , the U.S. Navy is the third largest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of personnel . It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of June 2019 [ update ] , making it the third-largest air force in the world , after the United States Air Force and the United States Army . The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy , which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter . After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers , the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates , the first ships of the U.S. Navy . The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers . It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan . The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world . The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence , deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific , the Mediterranean , and the Indian Ocean . It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world , engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises , making it a frequent actor in U.S. foreign and military policy .",

The grade of chief petty officer was established on 1 April 1893 for the United States Navy . The United States Congress first authorized the Coast Guard to use the promotion to chief petty officer on 18 May 1920 . Chief petty officer is also the final cadet grade in the U.S . Naval Sea Cadet Corps . Prior to 1958 , chief petty officer was the highest enlisted grade in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard . This changed on 20 May 1958 with the passage Pub.L . 85-422 , the Military Pay Act of 1958 , which established two new pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces . In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard , the new E-8 paygrade was called senior chief petty officer ( SCPO ) and the new E-9 paygrade master chief petty officer ( MCPO ) , with the first selectees promoting to their respective grades in 1959 and 1960 . Prior to establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades , chief petty officers could typically serve in uniform for 30 or more years . Shortly following establishment of the E-8 and E-9 grades , service limits currently known as high year tenure ( HYT ) were established by pay grade . Although these limits periodically flex based on Fleet manpower requirements , current HYT limits restrict chief petty officers not selected for promotion to senior chief petty officer to 24 years of service , after which they face mandatory retirement .",

Cross rating refers to the act of an enlisted sailor crossing from their current rating to another rating of their choice , provided their ASVAB scores are high enough and there are open slots for the rate . The Gunner 's Mate A school is held at Naval Training Center Great Lakes , Illinois and Yorktown , VA for the USCG . In its early years , the school was very hands-on , but it is now primarily conducted through technical educational tools , such as self-study computer-based training ( CBT ) . Training focuses on the operation , maintenance , and troubleshooting of naval guns , missile launchers and torpedoes as well as a strong emphasis on basic explosives , guidance and tracking systems , small arms , Naval ammunition classification , and safety .

The ship was a marked improvement over the previous Indiana-class battleships , correcting many of the defects in the design of those vessels . Among the most important improvements were significantly better seaworthiness owing to her greater freeboard and a more efficient arrangement of the armament . Iowa was designed to operate on the high seas , which had been the impetus to increase the freeboard . She was armed with a battery of four 12-inch ( 300 mm ) guns in two twin-gun turrets , supported by a secondary battery of eight 8-inch ( 200 mm ) guns . Upon entering service in June 1897 , Iowa conducted training operations in the Atlantic Ocean before moving to the Caribbean in early 1898 as tensions between the United States and Spain over Cuba grew , leading to the Spanish-American War . The ship took part in the bombardment of San Juan , Puerto Rico , and then participated in the blockade of Cuba during the war , and after the Spanish cruiser squadron was found in Santiago de Cuba , she patrolled off the harbor to block their escape . In the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July , Iowa assisted in the destruction of three of the four Spanish cruisers . After the war , Iowa spent the next several years conducting routine training exercises , serving with the Pacific Squadron from 1898 to 1902 , the South Atlantic Squadron until 1904 , and the North Atlantic Squadron until 1906 , when the latter two units were merged to form the Atlantic Fleet . Iowa was modernized between 1908 and 1910 ; she thereafter served as a training ship for naval cadets from the United States Naval Academy and for naval militia crews . Removed from service in 1913 and decommissioned in 1914 , she was reactivated after the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , initially serving as a receiving ship and then as a training vessel and guard ship .

  "/wiki/Ordinary_Seaman": "An ordinary seaman ( OS ) is a naval rating of the deck department of a ship . The position is an apprenticeship to become an able seaman , and has been for centuries . In modern times , an OS is required to work on a ship for a specific amount of time , gaining what is referred to as sea time . For centuries , the term ordinary seaman was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years ' experience at sea , who showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain . Historically in some navies and the merchant marine a sailor with less experience was called a landsman . An OS is generally not required to stand watch , but must pass examinations on watchstanding skills such as performing lookout duty and being a helmsman . Thus an OS will often be found on a ship 's bridge after working hours taking a turn at the ship 's wheel or being familiarized with bridge equipment . During the apprenticeship , an OS performs a variety of duties concerned with the operation and upkeep of deck department areas and equipment . These duties vary with the type of ship , the type of voyage , the number of crewmembers , the weather , the supervisor , and any number of other variables .

The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",

  "/wiki/USS_North_Dakota_(BB-29)": "USS North Dakota ( BB-29 ) was a dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy , the second member of the Delaware class , her only sister ship being Delaware . North Dakota was laid down at the Fore River Shipyard in December 1907 , was launched in November 1908 , and commissioned into the US Navy in April 1910 . She was armed with a main battery of ten 12-inch ( 305 mm ) guns and was capable of a top speed of 21 kn ( 24 mph ; 39 km/h ) . North Dakota was the first vessel of the US Navy to be named after the 39th state . North Dakota had a peaceful career ; she was present during the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914 , but did not see action . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , North Dakota remained in the US , training crewmen for the rapidly expanding wartime Navy , and therefore did not see combat . She remained on active duty through the early 1920s , until she was decommissioned under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty in November 1923 , and converted into a radio-controlled target ship . She served in that capacity until 1930 , when she was replaced in that role by Utah . In 1931 , she was sold for scrapping and thereafter dismantled .",

At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

  "/wiki/Ship's_Corporal": "Corporal is a military rank in use in some form by many militaries and by some police forces or other uniformed organizations . Within NATO , each member nation 's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-3 or OR-4 . However , there are often differences in how each nation ( or service in each nation ) employs corporals . Some militaries do n't have corporals , but may instead have a Junior Sergeant . In some militaries , the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers . However , in the United States Army , the rank of corporal is considered a lateral promotion from E-4 Specialist and usually only occurs when the soldier has been selected by a promotion board to become an E-5 Sergeant and is serving in an E-5 billet such as a fireteam leader in a rifle squad . The lateral promotion is used to make the soldier a non-commissioned officer without changing the soldier 's pay . As the Table of Organization & Equipment ( TO & E ) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant . In the United States Marine Corps , corporal is the Table of Organization ( TO ) rank for a rifle fire team leader , machine gun team leader , light mortar squad leader , and assault weapon squad leader , as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons ( i.e . medium mortars , heavy machine guns , and anti-tank missiles ) , armored vehicles ( e.g . tanks , light armored vehicles , and armored assault vehicles ) , and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer ( the gunner is a sergeant ) . In most countries that derive their military structure from the British military system , corporal is a more senior rank than that of private .",
  "/wiki/USS_Constitution": "USS Constitution , also known as Old Ironsides , is a wooden-hulled , three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy . She is the world 's oldest commissioned naval vessel still afloat . [ Note 1 ] She was launched in 1797 , one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed . The name Constitution was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed . Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy 's capital ships , and so Constitution and her sister ships were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period . She was built at Edmund Hartt 's shipyard in the North End of Boston , Massachusetts . Her first duties were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War . Constitution is most noted for her actions during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom , when she captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships : HMS Guerriere , Java , Pictou , Cyane , and Levant . The battle with Guerriere earned her the nickname Old Ironsides and public adoration that has repeatedly saved her from scrapping . She continued to serve as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons , and she circled the world in the 1840s . During the American Civil War , she served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy . She carried American artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of 1878 .",
