Construction on the church began in 1800 thanks in large part to the financial backing of the British royal family .

  "/wiki/Palladian_architecture": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today",

  "/wiki/Responsible_government": "Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability , the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy . Governments ( the equivalent of the executive branch ) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch , or , in a colonial context , to the imperial government , and in a republican context , to the president , either in full or in part . If the parliament is bicameral , then the government is responsible first to the parliament 's lower house , which is more representative than the upper house , as it usually has more members and they are always directly elected . Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways . Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments . This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers must have the privileges of the floor , which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament . [ clarification needed ] Secondly , and most importantly , although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign , they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament . When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government , the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election . Lastly , the head of state is in turn required to effectuate their executive power only through these responsible ministers . They must never attempt to set up a shadow government of executives or advisors and attempt to use them as instruments of government , or to rely upon their unofficial advice . They are bound to take no decision or action that is put into effect under the colour of their executive power without that action being as a result of the counsel and advisement of their responsible ministers . Their ministers are required to counsel them ( i.e. , explain to them and be sure they understand any issue that they will be called upon to decide ) and to form and have recommendations for them ( i.e. , their advice or advisement ) to choose from , which are the ministers ' formal , reasoned , recommendations as to what course of action should be taken",

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels",
