Located in the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan panhandle , it is a unified municipality and the second largest city in the United States by area . Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906 , when the government of what was then the District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900 . The municipality unified on July 1 , 1970 , when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality , which is larger by area than both Rhode Island and Delaware . Downtown Juneau ( 58\u00b018\u203207\u2033N 134\u00b025\u203211\u2033W / 58.30194\u00b0N 134.41972\u00b0W / 58.30194 ; -134.41972 ) is nestled at the base of Mount Juneau and across the channel from Douglas Island . As of the 2010 census , the City and Borough had a population of 31,276 . In 2018 , the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,114 , making it the second most populous city in Alaska after Anchorage . Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September . The city is named after a gold prospector from Quebec , Joe Juneau , though the place was for a time called Rockwell and then Harrisburg ( after Juneau 's co-prospector , Richard Harris ) . The Tlingit name of the town is Dz\u00e1ntik ' i H\u00e9eni ( Base of the Flounder 's River , dz\u00e1nti flounder , -k\u02bci base , h\u00e9en river ) , and Auke Bay just north of Juneau proper is called \u00c1ak ' w ( Little lake , \u00e1a lake , -k\u02bc diminutive ) in Tlingit . The Taku River , just south of Juneau , was named after the cold t'aakh wind , which occasionally blows down from the mountains . Juneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state .",
  "/wiki/Connecticut_panhandle": "The Connecticut Panhandle is the southwestern appendage of Connecticut , where it abuts New York State . It is contained entirely in Fairfield County and includes all of Greenwich , Stamford , New Canaan , and Darien , as well as parts of Norwalk and Wilton . It has some of the most expensive residential real estate in the United States . The irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 17th century , culminating with New York giving up its claim to this area , whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut . In exchange , New York received an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield , Connecticut , to the Massachusetts border , as well as undisputed claim to Rye , New York . The two British colonies negotiated an agreement on November 28 , 1683 , establishing the New York-Connecticut border as east of the Hudson River , north to Massachusetts . The east of the Byram River making up the Connecticut Panhandle were granted to Connecticut , in recognition of the wishes of the residents . In exchange , Rye was granted to New York , along with a wide strip of land known as the Oblong running north from Ridgefield to Massachusetts , alongside the New York counties of Westchester , Putnam , and Dutchess .",

  "/wiki/Florida_Panhandle": "The Florida Panhandle ( also West Florida and Northwest Florida ) is the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida , is a strip of land roughly long and wide , lying between Alabama on the north and the west , Georgia on the north , and the Gulf of Mexico to the south . Its eastern boundary is arbitrarily defined . As is the case with the other eight U.S. states that have panhandles , the geographic meaning of the term is inexact and elastic . References to the Florida Panhandle always include the ten counties west of the Apalachicola River , a natural geographic boundary , which was the historic dividing line between the British colonies of West Florida and East Florida . These western counties also lie in the Central Time Zone ( with the exception of Gulf County , which is divided between the Eastern and Central Time zones ) , while the rest of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone . References to the Panhandle may also include some or all of eight counties immediately east of the Apalachicola known as the Big Bend region , along the curve of Apalachee Bay . Like North Central Florida , the Panhandle is more similar in culture and climate to the Deep South than to South Florida in the lower peninsula , being known for its conservative politics and piney woods . The largest city in the Panhandle is Tallahassee , the state capital , population 188,107 ( 2014 ) . However , the largest population grouping is the Pensacola Metropolitan Area with a population of 474,081 .
