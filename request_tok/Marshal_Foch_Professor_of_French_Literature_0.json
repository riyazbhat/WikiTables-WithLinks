Vast numbers of popes , royalty , scientists , and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris . A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens : Coll\u00e8ge des Bernardins ( 18 , rue de Poissy 75005 ) , Hotel de Cluny ( 6 , Place Paul Painleve 75005 ) , College Sainte Barbe ( 4 , rue Valette 75005 ) , College d'Harcourt ( 44 Boulevard Saint-Michel 75006 ) , and Cordeliers ( 21 , Rue Ecole de Medecine 75006 ) .

Racine was primarily a tragedian , producing such examples of neoclassical perfection as Ph\u00e8dre , Andromaque , and Athalie . He did write one comedy , Les Plaideurs , and a muted tragedy , Esther for the young . Racine 's plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic ( 12 syllable ) French alexandrine . His writing is renowned for its elegance , purity , speed , and fury , and for what American poet Robert Lowell described as a diamond-edge , and the glory of its hard , electric rage . Racine 's dramaturgy is marked by his psychological insight , the prevailing passion of his characters , and the nakedness [ clarification needed ] of both plot and stage . The linguistic effects of Racine 's poetry are widely considered to be untranslatable , although many eminent poets have attempted to translate Racine 's work into English , including Lowell , Richard Wilbur , Ted Hughes , Tony Harrison , and Derek Mahon , and Friedrich Schiller into German . The latest translations of Racine 's plays into English have been by Alan Hollinghurst ( Berenice , Bajazet ) , by RADA director Edward Kemp ( Andromache ) , Neil Bartlett , and poet Geoffrey Alan Argent , who earned a 2011 American Book Award for the translating The Complete Plays of Jean Racine",
