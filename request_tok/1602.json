Shanghai SIPG won their first top-tier league titles on 7 November 2018 after the 2-1 victory against Beijing Renhe , ending a historic run for Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao , who had won seven consecutive titles beginning with the 2011 season . Policy regarding foreign players and U-23 domestic players continued to change in this season . At least one domestic player who is under the age of 23 ( born on or after 1 January 1995 ) must be in the starting eleven , the same as in the 2017 season . However , two foreign-player policies have changed : ( 1 ) the number of foreign players on a club 's roster has been reduced from five to four and ( 2 ) the total number of foreign players under contract with a club in a season has been reduced from seven to six . In addition , a new policy affecting both foreign players and U-23 domestic players has been introduced : The total number of foreign players appearing in matches must be no more than the total number of U-23 domestic players . Players from AFC countries no longer hold a special slot . But clubs can register one non-naturalized player from the Hong Kong Football Association , Macau Football Association or Chinese Taipei Football Association ( except goalkeepers ) as a native player . According to the Chinese FA , a non-naturalized player is a player who was first registered as a professional footballer in one of the three aforementioned football associations . For still more complexity concerning non-naturalized players , players from Hong Kong and Macau must be passport holders of the Hong Kong SAR or the Macau SAR , and players from Taiwan must be citizens of Taiwan . Policy of U-23 domestic players was relaxed in August for the 2018 Asian Games .",
