  "/wiki/Milan_High_School_(Michigan)": "Milan High School is the sole high school in Milan , Michigan . It is part of the Milan Area Schools . Established in the 19th century , the school has had three principal locations since 1900 . The first was a new building constructed that year at 100 Hurd Street , one block north of Milan 's downtown center . It originally housed all grades . The School Board also purchased and consolidated a number of undeveloped lots bounded by North Street to the west , East Miller Street to the north , Marvin Street to the east , and East Michigan Avenue to the south . This complex , three blocks north of the main school building , was originally developed as a set of athletic fields . In the 1930s , a new elementary school for Grades K through 6 was built at the corner of Marvin Street and East Michigan Avenue , while the original building from 1900 was doubled in size . The new west wing housed Milan Junior High School , serving grades 7 through 9 ; while the original , now east wing , continued to house Milan High School , serving grades 10 through 12 . As the population of the school district grew by leaps and bounds during and after World War II , the new elementary school was gradually expanded during the 1940s and 1950s , from the original 8 classrooms to 36 classrooms . Desirous of moving the high school away from the downtown area , and with the building built in 1900 becoming more and more expensive and difficult to maintain , a new high school was built at the corner of North and East Miller streets , opposite to the corner where the Varn D. Paddock Elementary School had been built . The new high school opened its doors in 1958 , and was gradually expanded until it encompassed the entire north side of the lot from North Street to Marvin Street .",
