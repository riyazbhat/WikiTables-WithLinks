  "/wiki/Bia_h\u01a1i": "Bia h\u01a1i ( literally translated : fresh beer ) , is a type of draught beer popular in Vietnam . Bia h\u01a1i is available primarily in northern Vietnam . It is mostly to be found in small bars and on street corners . The beer is brewed daily , then matured for a short period and once ready each bar gets a fresh batch delivered every day in steel barrels . It is a very light ( ~3 % alcohol ) refreshing lager at a fraction of the cost of draft or bottled beer in the Western-style bars . Bia h\u01a1i production is informal and not monitored by any health agency . It is typically priced between 8,000VND and 12,000VND .",
  "/wiki/Chanh_mu\u1ed1i": "Chanh mu\u1ed1i is a salted , pickled lime in Vietnamese cuisine . Its name comes from the Vietnamese words chanh ( meaning lime or lemon ) and mu\u1ed1i ( meaning salt ) . To make the chanh mu\u1ed1i , many limes ( often key limes ) are packed tightly in salt in a glass container and placed in the sun until they are pickled . During the process , juices are drawn off the limes , which dissolves the salt and produces a pickling liquid which immerses the finished chanh mu\u1ed1i .",
  "/wiki/Sugarcane_juice": "Sugarcane juice is the liquid extracted from pressed sugarcane . It is consumed as a beverage in many places , especially where sugarcane is commercially grown , such as Southeast Asia , the Indian Subcontinent , North Africa , and Latin America . In the United States where processed sugarcane syrup is used as a sweetener in food and beverage manufacturing , evaporated cane juice is considered by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to be a misleading term for sugar on product labels because the FDA regards juice as a liquid derived from fruits or vegetables ; the preferred term is cane sugar . Sugarcane juice is obtained by crushing peeled sugar cane in a mill and is one of the main precursors of rum .",
  "/wiki/Kumquat": "Kumquats ( or cumquats in Australian English , /\u02c8k\u028cmkw\u0252t/ ; Citrus japonica ) are a group of small fruit-bearing trees in the flowering plant family Rutaceae . They were previously classified as forming the now-historical genus Fortunella , or placed within Citrus sensu lato . The edible fruit closely resembles the orange ( Citrus sinensis ) in color and shape but is much smaller , being approximately the size of a large olive . Kumquat is a fairly cold-hardy citrus .",
  "/wiki/Ginseng": "Ginseng ( /\u02c8d\u0292\u026ans\u025b\u014b/ ) is the root of plants in the genus Panax , such as Korean ginseng ( P. ginseng ) , South China ginseng ( P. notoginseng ) , and American ginseng ( P. quinquefolius ) , typically characterized by the presence of ginsenosides and gintonin . Although ginseng has been used in traditional medicine over centuries , modern clinical research is inconclusive about its medical effectiveness . There is no substantial evidence that ginseng is effective for treating any medical condition , and its use has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) as a prescription drug . Although ginseng is commonly sold as a dietary supplement , inconsistent manufacturing practices for supplements have led to analyses showing that ginseng products may be contaminated with toxic metals or unrelated filler compounds , and its excessive use may have adverse effects or untoward interactions with prescription drugs .",

It can be found in China , Goa ( India ) , Vietnam , and throughout Southeast Asia . The snakes , preferably venomous ones , are not usually preserved for their meat but to have their essence and/or snake venom dissolved in the liquor . The snake venom proteins are quickly unfolded by the ethanol and therefore the completed beverage is safe to drink .

Today the species also occurs in southern India , Sri Lanka , virtually all of Southeast Asia , New Guinea and northern and eastern Australia , but this is probably the result of human translocations . It has a very long history ( c. 3,000 years ) of being cultivated for its edible seeds , and it is commonly cultivated in water gardens . It is the national flower of India and Vietnam .",

  "/wiki/Vietnamese_wine": "Vietnamese wine is wine produced in Vietnam . The area was first cultivated for viticulture during the French colonial rule of the region in the late 19th century . The region 's tropical climate was ill-suited for the type of Vitis vinifera that the French colonists were used to and the wine industry turned its attention to fruit wine production . The late 20th century saw a renewed focus on the development of Vitis vinifera with the assistance of flying winemakers from regions like Australia . In 1995 , a joint venture with Australian winemakers started an aggressive planting scheme to reintroduce international grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay to land that was until recently littered with landmines left over from the Vietnam War ."
