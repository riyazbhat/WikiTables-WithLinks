  "/wiki/Wooden": "Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants . It is an organic material - a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression . Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees , or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs . [ citation needed ] In a living tree it performs a support function , enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves . It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves , other growing tissues , and the roots . Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties , and to material engineered from wood , or wood chips or fiber . Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel , as a construction material , for making tools and weapons , furniture and paper . More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives , such as cellophane and cellulose acetate . As of 2005 , the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters , 47 % of which was commercial . As an abundant , carbon-neutral renewable resource , woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy . In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested . Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction",

  "/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster": "A Wild Mouse roller coaster ( also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse ) is a type of roller coaster characterized by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track , taking tight , flat turns ( without banking ) at modest speeds , yet producing high lateral G-forces . The track work is characterized by many turns and bunny hops , the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces . When approaching a turn from a straight section , the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight , and thus plunge off of the device , this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed roller coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach . Almost all Wild Mice feature switchback sections , consisting of several of these unbanked turns , separated by straight sections . Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0 , but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops ( for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan , which is no longer operating ) . Some riders , usually among taller people , report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns . [ citation needed ] The feeling of a Wild Mouse coaster is amplified by using cars that are wider than the track itself , giving the impression that the riders are hanging off the side or that they might fly out , thus giving it the name wild . Some may include trick-track - a straight piece of track banked slightly side to side designed to throw the rider left to right . Some wild mouse coasters , such as Primeval Whirl , also have spinning cars . The modern Wild Mouse was invented by German designer Franz Mack . In the original wooden Wild Mouse coasters of the 1960s and 1970s , the cars were so small that they could only fit two adults in close contact . While the low capacity of these rides led to long lines , the cars were small by design"
