Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:17 UTC . Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC ; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours , 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 13:32 UTC , and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages - a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 . The astronauts used Eagle 's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth .",

It was delivered in the Oval Office of the White House . The purpose of the speech was for Nixon to announce that he was resigning from office .

Nixon ultimately lost much of his popular and political support as a result of the scandal . At the time of his resignation , he faced almost certain impeachment and removal from office . In his address , Nixon said he was resigning because I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the nation would require . He also stated his hope that , by resigning , I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America . Nixon acknowledged that some of his judgments were wrong , and he expressed contrition , saying : I deeply regret any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision . He made no mention , however , of the articles of impeachment pending against him .
