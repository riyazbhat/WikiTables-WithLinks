  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state .

Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",
