It plays in the Paulist\u00e3o , the State of S\u00e3o Paulo 's premier state league , as well as the Brasileir\u00e3o , the top tier of the Brazilian football league system . The club was founded in 1912 by the initiative of three sports enthusiasts from Santos by Raimundo Marques , M\u00e1rio Ferraz de Campos , and Argemiro de Souza J\u00fanior as a response to the lack of representation the city had in football . Since then , Santos became one of Brazil 's most successful clubs , becoming a symbol of Jogo Bonito ( English : the Beautiful Game ) in football culture , hence the motto T\u00e9cnica e Disciplina ( Technique and discipline ) . The most recognized Santista anthem is the Le\u00e3o do Mar written by Mangeri Neto . This was largely thanks to the Peixe 's golden generation of the 1960s which contained players such as Gilmar , Mauro Ramos , Meng\u00e1lvio , Coutinho , Pepe and Pel\u00e9 , named the Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee , and widely regarded as the best and most accomplished footballer in the game 's history . Os Sant\u00e1sticos , considered by some the best club team of all times , won a total of 24 titles during that decade including five consecutive Brasileir\u00f5es , a feat that remains unequaled today . Os Sant\u00e1sticos won four competitions in 1962 , thus completing a quadruple , comprising the Paulist\u00e3o , the Brasileir\u00e3o , the Copa Libertadores and the European/South American Cup .
