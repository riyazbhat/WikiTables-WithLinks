  "/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg": "The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought December 11-15 , 1862 , in and around Fredericksburg , Virginia , in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War . The combat , between the Union Army of the Potomac commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee , was part of the Union Army 's futile frontal attacks on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city . It is remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war , with Union casualties more than twice as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates . A visitor to the battlefield described the battle to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as a butchery . Burnside 's plan was to cross the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg in mid-November and race to the Confederate capital of Richmond before Lee 's army could stop him . Bureaucratic delays prevented Burnside from receiving the necessary pontoon bridges in time and Lee moved his army to block the crossings . When the Union army was finally able to build its bridges and cross under fire , direct combat within the city resulted on December 11-12 . Union troops prepared to assault Confederate defensive positions south of the city and on a strongly fortified ridge just west of the city known as Marye 's Heights . On December 13 , the Left Grand Division of Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin was able to pierce the first defensive line of Confederate Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson to the south , but was finally repulsed . Burnside ordered the Right and Center Grand Divisions of Maj. Gens . Edwin V. Sumner and Joseph Hooker to launch multiple frontal assaults against Lt. Gen. James Longstreet 's position on Marye 's Heights - all were repulsed with heavy losses . On December 15 , Burnside withdrew his army , ending another failed Union campaign in the Eastern Theater .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Perryville": "The Battle of Perryville ( also known as the Battle of Chaplin Hills ) was fought on October 8 , 1862 , in the Chaplin Hills west of Perryville , Kentucky , as the culmination of the Confederate Heartland Offensive ( Kentucky Campaign ) during the American Civil War . Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg 's Army of Mississippi [ b ] initially won a tactical victory against primarily a single corps of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell 's Union Army of the Ohio . The battle is considered a strategic Union victory , sometimes called the Battle for Kentucky , since Bragg withdrew to Tennessee soon thereafter . The Union retained control of the critical border state of Kentucky for the remainder of the war . On October 7 , Buell 's army , in pursuit of Bragg , converged on the small crossroads town of Perryville in three columns . Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general , on Peters Hill , when the Confederate infantry arrived . Both sides were desperate to get access to fresh water . The next day , at dawn , fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike , halting just before the Confederate line . After noon , a Confederate division struck the Union left flank - the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook - and forced it to fall back . When more Confederate divisions joined the fray , the Union line made a stubborn stand , counterattacked , but finally fell back with some units routed . Buell , several miles behind the action , was unaware that a major battle was taking place and did not send any reserves to the front until late in the afternoon . The Union troops on the left flank , reinforced by two brigades , stabilized their line , and the Confederate attack sputtered to a halt .",

  "/wiki/Charles_Davis_Jameson": "Charles Davis Jameson ( February 24 , 1827 - November 6 , 1862 ) was an American Civil War general and Democratic Party candidate for Governor of Maine . He contracted camp fever ( typhoid ) at the Battle of Fair Oaks , returned to his native state of Maine , dying in transit or soon after . Jameson was born in Gorham , Maine , but his family moved to the lumbering and sawmilling center of Old Town , Maine when he was still a child . Jameson became a successful lumberman , and in 1860 was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Maine . With the outbreak of war in 1861 he was elected Colonel commanding the 2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment , the first Maine unit to leave the state for the front . He led his regiment into the First Battle of Bull Run and was soon made Brigadier General of Volunteers . In the months after Bull Run the Democratic Party of Maine split into anti-war and pro-war factions , and Jameson became the gubernatorial candidate of the War Democrats . He lost the election to Republican Israel Washburn , Jr. from the neighboring town of Orono , but narrowly beat the anti-war Democrat , John W. Dana . In 1862 , however , with the war going badly , Jameson was largely abandoned by Democratic voters when he ran again , though the anti-war Democratic candidate was narrowly defeated by Republican Abner Coburn . Later that year at the Battle of Fair Oaks , Jameson was wounded and subsequently disabled by camp fever ( likely typhoid fever ) and allowed to return to Maine . He died in Old Town on November 6 , 1862 and is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Stillwater , Maine .

  "/wiki/Military_Governor": "A governor is , in most cases , a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government , ranking under the head of state . In federations , governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected . The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems , with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power , while others having a complete control over the entire government . Historically , the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area , such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company . These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces . There can also be non-political governors : high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management , styled governor ( s ) , who simply govern an institution , such as a corporation or a bank . For example , in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries , there are prison governors ( wardens in the United States ) , school governors and bank governors . The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial , from the Latin root gubernare . The historical female form is governess , though female officials are referred to by the gender-neutral form governor ( without the gender specific suffix ) of the noun to avoid confusion with other meanings of the term .",
  "/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States": "The vice president of the United States is the second-highest officer in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government , after the president of the United States , and ranks first in the presidential line of succession .

In this capacity , the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations , but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote . The vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress . The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College . Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment , ratified in 1967 , created a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession , establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress . Prior to 1967 , in the event a vice president succeeded to the presidency , died , or resigned from office , the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began . The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council , and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution . The Office of the Vice President assists and organises the vice president 's official functions . The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 constitutional Convention . Especially over the past 100 years , the vice presidency has evolved into a position of domestic and foreign policy political power , and is now widely seen as an integral part of a president 's administration . As the vice president 's role within the executive branch has expanded , his role within the legislative branch has contracted ; for example , he presides over the Senate only infrequently .",
