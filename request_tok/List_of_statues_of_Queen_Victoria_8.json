  "/wiki/City_of_London": "The City of London is a city , county and a local government district [ note 1 ] that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district ( CBD ) of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_London": "The Royal Exchange in London was founded in the 16th century by the merchant Sir Thomas Gresham on the suggestion of his factor Richard Clough to act as a centre of commerce for the City of London . The site was provided by the City of London Corporation and the Worshipful Company of Mercers , who still jointly own the freehold . It is trapezoidal in shape and is flanked by Cornhill and Threadneedle Street , which converge at Bank junction in the heart of the City . It lies in the ward of Cornhill . The building 's original design was inspired by a bourse Gresham had seen in Antwerp , the Antwerp bourse , and was Britain 's first specialist commercial building . It has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt . The present building was designed by Sir William Tite in the 1840s . The site was notably occupied by the Lloyd 's insurance market for nearly 150 years . Today the Royal Exchange contains a Courtyard Grand Cafe , Threadneedle Cocktail Bar , Sauterelle Restaurant , luxury shops , and offices . Traditionally , the steps of the Royal Exchange is the place where certain royal proclamations ( such as the dissolution of parliament ) are read out by either a herald or a crier . Following the death or abdication of a monarch and the confirmation of the next monarch 's accession to the throne by the Accession Council , the Royal Exchange Building is one of the locations where a herald proclaims the new monarch 's reign to the public .",

  "/wiki/Croydon": "Croydon is a large town in south London , England , 9.4 miles ( 15.1 km ) south of Charing Cross . The principal settlement in the London Borough of Croydon , it is one of the largest commercial districts outside Central London , with an extensive shopping district and night-time economy . The entire town had a population of 192,064 as of 2011 , whilst the wider borough had a population of 384,837 . Historically part of the hundred of Wallington in the county of Surrey , at the time of the Norman conquest of England Croydon had a church , a mill , and around 365 inhabitants , as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 . Croydon expanded in the Middle Ages as a market town and a centre for charcoal production , leather tanning and brewing . The Surrey Iron Railway from Croydon to Wandsworth opened in 1803 and was the world 's first public railway . Later nineteenth century railway building facilitated Croydon 's growth as a commuter town for London . By the early 20th century , Croydon was an important industrial area , known for car manufacture , metal working and Croydon Airport . In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the service economy , brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the Whitgift Centre , the largest shopping centre in Greater London until 2008 . Croydon was amalgamated into Greater London in 1965 . Croydon lies on a transport corridor between central London and the south coast of England , to the north of two high gaps in the North Downs , one taken by the A23 Brighton Road and the main railway line through Purley and Merstham and the other by the A22 from Purley to the M25 Godstone interchange . Road traffic is diverted away from a largely pedestrianised town centre , mostly consisting of North End .",

It was commissioned by the Kensington Golden Jubilee Memorial Executive Committee , who sought design proposals . Princess Louise was reluctant to take up a commission to sculpt her mother , but was persuaded to make a model by her friend , the artist Lawrence Alma Tadema . She submitted her entry anonymously , and it was selected by the judging panel . Princess Louise was herself resident at Kensington Palace , and she sculpted the statue at her studio there ( although some press reports suggested it was made by her tutor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm ) . The completed sculpture was unveiled by Queen Victoria on 28 June 1893 .",

  "/wiki/Princess_Louise,_Duchess_of_Argyll": "Princess Louise , Duchess of Argyll , VA , CI , GCVO , GBE , RRC , GCStJ ( Louisa Caroline Alberta ; 18 March 1848 - 3 December 1939 ) was the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . In her public life , she was a strong proponent of the arts and higher education and of the feminist cause . Her early life was spent moving among the various royal residences in the company of her family . When her father , the prince consort , died on 14 December 1861 , the court went into a long period of mourning , to which with time Louise became unsympathetic . Louise was an able sculptor and artist , and several of her sculptures remain today . She was also a supporter of the feminist movement , corresponding with Josephine Butler , and visiting Elizabeth Garrett . Before her marriage , from 1866 to 1871 , Louise served as an unofficial secretary to her mother , the Queen . The question of Louise 's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s . Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested , but Victoria did not want her to marry a foreign prince , and therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the British aristocracy . Despite opposition from members of the royal family , Louise fell in love with John , Marquess of Lorne , the heir of the Duke of Argyll . Victoria consented to the marriage , which took place on 21 March 1871 . Despite a happy beginning , the two drifted apart , possibly because of their childlessness and the queen 's constraints on their activities .",

Historically the area lay within St Margaret 's parish , City and Liberty of Westminster , Middlesex . The name Westminster ( Old English : Westmynstre ) originated from the informal description of the abbey church and royal peculiar of St Peter 's ( Westminster Abbey ) , literally West of the City of London ( indeed , until the Reformation there was a reference to the 'East Minster ' at Minories ( Holy Trinity Priory , Aldgate ) east of the City ) . The abbey was part of the royal palace that had been created here by Edward the Confessor . It has been the home of the permanent institutions of England 's government continuously since about 1200 ( High Middle Ages ' Plantagenet times ) , and from 1707 the British Government . In a government context , Westminster often refers to the Parliament of the United Kingdom , located in the UNESCO World Heritage Palace of Westminster - also known as the Houses of Parliament . The closest tube stations are Westminster and St James 's Park , on the Jubilee , Circle , and District lines . The area is the centre of Her Majesty 's Government , with Parliament in the Palace of Westminster and most of the major Government ministries known as Whitehall , itself the site of the royal palace that replaced that at Westminster .
