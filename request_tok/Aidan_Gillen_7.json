The five subjects are , in chronological order : the illegal drug trade , the seaport system , the city government and bureaucracy , education and schools , and the print news medium . The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles , as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles . Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama , the show is really about the American city , and about how we live together . It 's about how institutions have an effect on individuals . Whether one is a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge or a lawyer , all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed . The Wire is lauded for its literary themes , its uncommonly accurate exploration of society and politics , and its realistic portrayal of urban life .
