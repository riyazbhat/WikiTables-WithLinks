  "/wiki/Boxing": "Boxing is a combat sport in which two people , usually wearing protective gloves , throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring . Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games - it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing , disqualification of an opponent , or resignation of an opponent . When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing , the judges ' scorecards determine the victor . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , professional bouts are considered a draw . In Olympic boxing , because a winner must be declared , judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria . While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history , the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC . The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece , where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules .",

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

Spanning 10,990 square kilometres ( 4,240 sq mi ) in area , it is the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean ( after Cuba and Hispaniola ) . Jamaica lies about 145 kilometres ( 90 mi ) south of Cuba , and 191 kilometres ( 119 mi ) west of Hispaniola ( the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) ; the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 kilometres ( 134 mi ) to the north-west . Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 . With 2.9 million people , Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas ( after the United States and Canada ) , and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean .

  "/wiki/Sprint_(running)": "Sprinting is running over a short distance in a limited period of time . It is used in many sports that incorporate running , typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal , or avoiding or catching an opponent . Human physiology dictates that a runner 's near-top speed can not be maintained for more than 30-35 seconds due to the depletion of phosphocreatine stores in muscles , and perhaps secondarily to excessive metabolic acidosis as a result of anaerobic glycolysis . In athletics and track and field , sprints ( or dashes ) are races over short distances . They are among the oldest running competitions , being recorded at the Ancient Olympic Games . Three sprints are currently held at the modern Summer Olympics and outdoor World Championships : the 100 metres , 200 metres , and 400 metres . At the professional level , sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before driving forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained . The set position differs depending on the start . The use of starting blocks allows the sprinter to perform an enhanced isometric preload ; this generates muscular pre-tension which is channelled into the subsequent forward drive , making it more powerful . Body alignment is of key importance in producing the optimal amount of force . Ideally the athlete should begin in a 4-point stance and drive forwards , pushing off using both legs for maximum force production . Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events , with the sole exception of the 400 m indoors .",

  "/wiki/Pole_vault": "Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole ( which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber ) as an aid to jump over a bar . Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks , Cretans and Celts . It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and since 2000 for women . It is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics , alongside the high jump , long jump and triple jump . It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate , even at a basic level . A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics , including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg , reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports . Running speed , however , may be the most dominant factor . Physical attributes such as speed , agility and strength are essential to pole vaulting effectively , but technical skill is an equally if not more important element . The object of pole vaulting is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights ( standards ) without knocking it down .",

  "/wiki/Tennis": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ) . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will . Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as lawn tennis . It had close connections both to various field ( lawn ) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term tennis referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis . The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .",

It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east , with the R\u00edo de la Plata ( River of Silver ) to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast . Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.45 million people , of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city , Montevideo . With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometers ( 68,000 sq mi ) , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America , after Suriname . Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4,000 years before the Portuguese established Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento in 1680 ; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans relatively late compared with neighboring countries . Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century , signifying the competing claims over the region . Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828 , following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain , and later Argentina and Brazil . It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century , with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics . A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century , culminating in a 1973 coup , which established a civic-military dictatorship . The military government persecuted leftists , socialists , and political opponents , resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of torture by the military ; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985 . Uruguay is today a democratic constitutional republic , with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government . Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy , peace , low perception of corruption , e-government , and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom , size of the middle class and prosperity ."
