  "/wiki/Pickling": "Pickling is the process of preserving or extending the shelf life of food by either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar .

The resulting food is called a pickle , or , to prevent ambiguity , prefaced with pickled . Foods that are pickled include vegetables , fruits , meats , fish , dairy and eggs . A distinguishing characteristic is a pH of 4.6 or lower , which is sufficient to kill most bacteria . Pickling can preserve perishable foods for months . Antimicrobial herbs and spices , such as mustard seed , garlic , cinnamon or cloves , are often added . If the food contains sufficient moisture , a pickling brine may be produced simply by adding dry salt . For example , sauerkraut and Korean kimchi are produced by salting the vegetables to draw out excess water . Natural fermentation at room temperature , by lactic acid bacteria , produces the required acidity . Other pickles are made by placing vegetables in vinegar",
