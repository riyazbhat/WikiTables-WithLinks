  "/wiki/Motorola_DynaTAC": "DynaTAC is a series of cellular telephones manufactured by Motorola , Inc. from 1983 to 1994 . The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X commercial portable cellular phone received approval from the U.S. FCC on September 21 , 1983 . A full charge took roughly 10 hours , and it offered 30 minutes of talk time . It also offered an LED display for dialing or recall of one of 30 phone numbers . It was priced at $ 3,995 in 1984 , its commercial release year , equivalent to $ 9,831 in 2019 . DynaTAC was an abbreviation of Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage . Several models followed , starting in 1985 with the 8000s , and continuing with periodic updates of increasing frequency until 1993 's Classic II . The DynaTAC was replaced in most roles by the much smaller Motorola MicroTAC when it was first introduced in 1989 , and by the time of the Motorola StarTAC 's release in 1996 , it was obsolete .",
  "/wiki/LED": "A light-emitting diode ( LED ) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it . Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes , releasing energy in the form of photons . The color of the light ( corresponding to the energy of the photons ) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor . White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device . Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962 , the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light . Infrared LEDs are used in remote-control circuits , such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics . The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red . Modern LEDs are available across the visible , ultraviolet , and infrared wavelengths , with high light output . Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps , replacing small incandescent bulbs , and in seven-segment displays . Recent developments have produced high-output white light LEDs suitable for room and outdoor area lighting . LEDs have led to new displays and sensors , while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology . LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources , including lower energy consumption , longer lifetime , improved physical robustness , smaller size , and faster switching .",
  "/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System": "Advanced Mobile Phone System ( AMPS ) was an analog mobile phone system standard developed by Bell Labs , and officially introduced in the Americas on October 13 , 1983 , Israel in 1986 , Australia in 1987 , Singapore in 1988 , and Pakistan in 1990 . It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America ( and other locales ) through the 1980s and into the 2000s . As of February 18 , 2008 , carriers in the United States were no longer required to support AMPS and companies such as AT & T and Verizon Communications have discontinued this service permanently . AMPS was discontinued in Australia in September 2000 , in Pakistan by October 2004 , in Israel by January 2010 , and Brazil by 2010 .",
  "/wiki/GSM": "The Global System for Mobile Communications ( GSM ) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( ETSI ) to describe the protocols for second-generation ( 2G ) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets . It was first deployed in Finland in December 1991 . By the mid-2010s , it became a global standard for mobile communications achieving over 90% market share , and operating in over 193 countries and territories . 2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation ( 1G ) analog cellular networks . The GSM standard originally described a digital , circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony . This expanded over time to include data communications , first by circuit-switched transport , then by packet data transport via General Packet Radio Service ( GPRS ) , and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution ( EDGE ) . Subsequently , the 3GPP developed third-generation ( 3G ) UMTS standards , followed by fourth-generation ( 4G ) LTE Advanced standards , which do not form part of the ETSI GSM standard . GSM is a trade mark owned by the GSM Association . It may also refer to the ( initially ) most common voice codec used , Full Rate .",
  "/wiki/Vacuum_Fluorescent_Display": "A vacuum fluorescent display ( VFD ) is a display device once commonly used on consumer electronics equipment such as video cassette recorders , car radios , and microwave ovens . A VFD operates on the principle of cathodoluminescence , roughly similar to a cathode ray tube , but operating at much lower voltages . Each tube in a VFD has a phosphor coated anode that is bombarded by electrons emitted from the cathode filament . In fact , each tube in a VFD is a triode vacuum tube because it also has a mesh control grid . Unlike liquid crystal displays , a VFD emits a very bright light with high contrast and can support display elements of various colors . Standard illumination figures for VFDs are around 640 cd/m2 with high-brightness VFDs operating at 4,000 cd/m2 , and experimental units as high as 35,000 cd/m2 depending on the drive voltage and its timing . The choice of color ( which determines the nature of the phosphor ) and display brightness significantly affect the lifetime of the tubes , which can range from as low as 1,500 hours for a vivid red VFD to 30,000 hours for the more common green ones . Cadmium was commonly used in VFDs in the past , but the current RoHS-compliant VFDs have eliminated this metal from their construction . VFDs can display seven-segment numerals , multi-segment alpha-numeric characters or can be made in a dot-matrix to display different alphanumeric characters and symbols . In practice , there is little limit to the shape of the image that can be displayed : it depends solely on the shape of phosphor on the anode ( s ) . The first VFD was the single indication DM160 by Philips in 1959 . The first multi-segment VFD was the 1967 Japanese single-digit , seven-segment device .",
  "/wiki/Motorola_MicroTAC": "The Motorola MicroTAC was a cellular phone first manufactured as an analog version in 1989 . GSM-compatible and TDMA/Dual-Mode versions were introduced in 1994 . The MicroTAC introduced an innovative new flip design , where the mouthpiece folded over the keypad , although on later production the mouthpiece was actually located in the base of the phone , along with the ringer . This set the standard and became the model for modern flip phones today . Its predecessor was the much larger Motorola DynaTAC and it was succeeded by the Motorola StarTAC in 1996 . TAC was an abbreviation of Total Area Coverage in all three models .",

  "/wiki/Digital_AMPS": "IS-54 and IS-136 are second-generation ( 2G ) mobile phone systems , known as Digital AMPS ( D-AMPS ) , and a further development of the North American 1G mobile system Advanced Mobile Phone System ( AMPS ) . It was once prevalent throughout the Americas , particularly in the United States and Canada since the first commercial network was deployed in 1993 . D-AMPS is considered end-of-life , and existing networks have mostly been replaced by GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 technologies . This system is most often referred to as TDMA . That name is based on the abbreviation for time division multiple access , a common multiple access technique which is used in most 2G standards , including GSM , as well as in IS-54 and IS-136 . However , D-AMPS has been competing against GSM and systems based on code division multiple access ( CDMA ) for adoption by the network carriers , although it is now being phased out in favor of GSM/GPRS and CDMA2000 technology . D-AMPS uses existing AMPS channels and allows for smooth transition between digital and analog systems in the same area . Capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 kHz channel pair into three time slots ( hence time division ) and digitally compressing the voice data , yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell . A digital system also made calls more secure in the beginning , as analogue scanners could not access digital signals . Calls were encrypted , using CMEA , which was later found to be weak . IS-136 added a number of features to the original IS-54 specification , including text messaging , circuit switched data ( CSD ) , and an improved compression protocol . SMS and CSD were both available as part of the GSM protocol , and IS-136 implemented them in a nearly identical fashion .",
  "/wiki/Motorola_StarTAC": "The Motorola StarTAC , first released on 3 January 1996 , is the first ever clamshell ( flip ) mobile phone . The StarTAC is the successor of the MicroTAC , a semi-clamshell design first launched in 1989 . Whereas the MicroTAC 's flip folded down from below the keypad , the StarTAC folded up from above the display . In 2005 , PC World named the StarTAC as the 6th Greatest Gadget of the Past 50 Years ( out of a list of fifty ) . The StarTAC was among the first mobile phones to gain widespread consumer adoption ; approximately 60 million StarTACs were sold . The StarTAC brand was revived in 2004 and 2007 for a series of flip phones exclusive to some Asian markets , and again for a cordless phone model .",
  "/wiki/CDMA": "Code-division multiple access ( CDMA ) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies . CDMA is an example of multiple access , where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel . This allows several users to share a band of frequencies ( see bandwidth ) . To permit this without undue interference between the users , CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme ( where each transmitter is assigned a code ) . CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards . IS-95 , also called cdmaOne , and its 3G evolution CDMA2000 , are often simply referred to as CDMA , but UMTS , the 3G standard used by GSM carriers , also uses wideband CDMA , or W-CDMA , as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA , as its radio technologies .",

  "/wiki/OLED": "An organic light-emitting diode ( OLED or Organic LED ) , also known as an organic EL ( organic electroluminescent ) diode , is a light-emitting diode ( LED ) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current . This organic layer is situated between two electrodes ; typically , at least one of these electrodes is transparent . OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens , computer monitors , portable systems such as smartphones , handheld game consoles and PDAs . A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications . There are two main families of OLED : those based on small molecules and those employing polymers . Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell ( LEC ) which has a slightly different mode of operation . An OLED display can be driven with a passive-matrix ( PMOLED ) or active-matrix ( AMOLED ) control scheme . In the PMOLED scheme , each row ( and line ) in the display is controlled sequentially , one by one , whereas AMOLED control uses a thin-film transistor backplane to directly access and switch each individual pixel on or off , allowing for higher resolution and larger display sizes . An OLED display works without a backlight because it emits visible light . Thus , it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) . In low ambient light conditions ( such as a dark room ) , an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD , regardless of whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight . OLED displays are made in the same way as LCDs , but after TFT ( for active matrix displays ) , addressable grid ( for passive matrix displays ) or ITO segment ( for segment displays ) formation , the display is coated with hole injection , transport and blocking layers , as well with electroluminescent material after the 2 first layers , after which ITO or metal may be applied again as a cathode and later the entire stack of materials is encapsulated ."
