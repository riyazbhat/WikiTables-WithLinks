He was formerly a resident of Texas ( and a member of the Turkey City Writer 's Workshop ) , and now lives in North Carolina . Shiner graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1973 . Several of his novels have rock music as a theme or main focus , especially the musicians of the late 1960s ; for example , Shiner 's 1993 novel Glimpses considers the great never-recorded albums of The Doors , Brian Wilson , The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix . Say Goodbye : The Laurie Moss Story ( 1999 ) focuses on a fictional up-and-coming female musician and her subsequent fall back down . Slam ( 1990 ) is immersed in skate punk and anarchist culture . Perhaps because novels with music as a major theme are not generally considered mainstream genre material , his work has frequently been overlooked .

Martin-edited anthology Wild Cards , notably creating that universe 's most powerful character , the tantric sex magic wielding pimp , Fortunato . In July 2007 Shiner created the web site Fiction Liberation Front ( FLF ) as a venue for his short stories .
