  "/wiki/Pentecostal": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field .",
  "/wiki/Assemblies_of_God": "The Assemblies of God ( AG ) , officially the World Assemblies of God Fellowship , is a group of over 144 autonomous self-governing associated national groupings of churches which together form the world 's largest Pentecostal denomination . It is the fourth largest international Christian group of denominations and the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world . As an international fellowship , the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous ; however , they are united by shared beliefs and history . The Assemblies originated from the Azusa Street Revival of the early 20th century . This revival led to the founding of the Assemblies of God in the United States in 1914 . Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches , the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement . It was not until 1988 , however , that the world fellowship was formed . As a Pentecostal fellowship , the Assemblies of God believes in the Pentecostal distinctive of baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues . The Assemblies of God should not be confused with the Assemblies of God International Fellowship , the International Assemblies of God Fellowship , and the Independent Assemblies of God International , all of which are Pentecostal denominations .",

  "/wiki/Evangelical": "Evangelicalism ( /\u02cci\u02d0v\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0292\u025bl\u026ak\u0259l\u026az\u0259m , \u02cc\u025bv\u00e6n- , -\u0259n/ ) , evangelical Christianity , or evangelical Protestantism , [ note 1 ] is a worldwide , trans-denominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace , solely through faith in Jesus 's atonement . Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Orthodox": "The name Greek Orthodox Church ( Greek : \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b7 \u1f19\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 , Ellinorth\u00f3doxi Ekklis\u00eda , IPA : [ elinor\u02c8\u03b8o\u00f0oksi ekli\u02c8sia ] ) , or Greek Orthodoxy , is a term referring to the body of several Churches within the larger communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity , whose liturgy is or was traditionally conducted in Koine Greek , the original language of the Septuagint and the New Testament , and whose history , traditions , and theology are rooted in the early Church Fathers and the culture of the Byzantine Empire . Greek Orthodox Christianity has also traditionally placed heavy emphasis and awarded high prestige to traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and asceticism , with origins in Early Christianity in the Near East and in Byzantine Anatolia . Historically , the term Greek Orthodox has also been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox Churches in general , since Greek in Greek Orthodox can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire . During the first eight centuries of Christian history , most major intellectual , cultural , and social developments in the Christian Church took place within the Empire or in the sphere of its influence , where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings . Over time , most parts of the liturgy , traditions , and practices of the church of Constantinople were adopted by all , and still provide the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy . Thus , the Eastern Church came to be called Greek Orthodox in the same way that the Western Church is called Roman Catholic . However , the appellation Greek was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches in connection with their peoples ' national awakenings , from as early as the 10th century A.D . Thus , today it is generally only those churches that are most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture that are called Greek Orthodox .",
  "/wiki/St_John's_Church,_Kingston_upon_Thames": "The Church of St John the Evangelist , or more commonly , St John 's Church , is an Anglican church in Kingston upon Thames in the Diocese of Southwark . It is located to the south of the town centre . The church dates from June 1870 , when a temporary iron building was constructed on the corner of Springfield Road and Denmark Road . Bishop Samuel Wilberforce laid the foundation stone for a permanent church in July 1871 , on a site donated by William Mercer in the centre of the new Spring Grove Estate . Mercer also gave \u00a32000 towards the cost of building the church , but it was with difficulty that \u00a37000 was raised to build the essentials . The church was consecrated in November 1872 without the tower or spire that were in the original design by the Surbiton architect A. J. Phelps and with little internal ornament . Carvings , paintings , coloured windows and an organ were introduced over time , but the tower , a squat structure with octagonal turret in matching style , was not added until 1935 . The church has been Grade II listed since March 1975 . In 1974 , the pews were removed and new heating and lighting installed , to allow Kingston Polytechnic to use the church on weekdays as an examination hall . Later , the choir stalls and the pulpit were removed ."
