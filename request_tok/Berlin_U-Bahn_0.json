It came into full operation two days after a ceremonial opening on 26 May 2006 . It is located on the site of the historic Lehrter Bahnhof , and until it opened as a main line station , it was a stop on the Berlin S-Bahn suburban railway temporarily named Berlin Hauptbahnhof-Lehrter Bahnhof . The station is operated by DB Station & Service , a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG , and is classified as a Category 1 station , one of 21 in Germany and four in Berlin , the others being Berlin Gesundbrunnen , Berlin S\u00fcdkreuz and Berlin Ostbahnhof . Lehrter Bahnhof ( Lehrte Station ) opened in 1871 as the terminus of the railway linking Berlin with Lehrte , near Hanover , which later became Germany 's most important east-west main line . In 1882 , with the completion of the Stadtbahn ( City Railway , Berlin 's four-track central elevated railway line , which carries both local and main line services ) , just north of the station , a smaller interchange station called Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was opened to provide connections with the new line . This station later became part of the Berlin S-Bahn . In 1884 , after the closure of nearby Hamburger Bahnhof ( Hamburg Station ) , Lehrter Bahnhof became the terminus for trains to and from Hamburg . Following heavy damage during World War II , limited services to the main station were resumed , but then suspended in 1951 . In 1957 , with the railways to West Berlin under the control of East Germany , Lehrter Bahnhof was demolished , but Lehrter Stadtbahnhof continued as a stop on the S-Bahn . In 1987 , it was extensively renovated to commemorate Berlin 's 750th anniversary .
