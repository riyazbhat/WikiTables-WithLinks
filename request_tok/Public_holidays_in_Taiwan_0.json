On the Gregorian calendar , the Northward equinox can occur as early as 19 March or as late as 21 March at Greenwich .

Balancing the increases of the common years against the losses of the leap years keeps the calendar date of the March equinox from drifting more than one day from 20 March each year . The March equinox may be taken to mark the beginning of spring and the end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere but marks the beginning of autumn and the end of summer in the Southern Hemisphere . In astronomy , the March equinox is the zero point of sidereal time and , consequently , right ascension .
