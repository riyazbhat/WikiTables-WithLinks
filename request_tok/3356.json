  "/wiki/Mobile_devices": "A mobile device ( or handheld computer ) is a computer small enough to hold and operate in the hand . Typically , any handheld computer device will have an LCD or OLED flatscreen interface , providing a touchscreen interface with digital buttons and keyboard or physical buttons along with a physical keyboard . Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , cellular networks or near field communication ( NFC ) . Integrated cameras , the ability to place and receive voice and video telephone calls , video games , and Global Positioning System ( GPS ) capabilities are common . Power is typically provided by a lithium battery . Mobile devices may run mobile operating systems that allow third-party apps specialized for said capabilities to be installed and run . Early smartphones were joined in the late 2000s by larger , but otherwise essentially the same , tablets . Input and output is now usually via a touch-screen interface . Phones/tablets and personal digital assistants may provide much of the functionality of a laptop/desktop computer but more conveniently , in addition to exclusive features . Enterprise digital assistants can provide additional business functionality such as integrated data capture via barcode , RFID and smart card readers . By 2010 , mobile devices often contained sensors such as accelerometers , magnetometers and gyroscopes , allowing detection of orientation and motion . Mobile devices may provide biometric user authentication such as face recognition or fingerprint recognition .",

  "/wiki/Mobile_Phones": "A mobile phone , cellular phone , cell phone , cellphone , or hand phone , sometimes shortened to simply mobile , cell or just phone , is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area . The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator , which provides access to the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) . Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture , and , therefore , mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones , in North America . In addition to telephony , 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services , such as text messaging , MMS , email , Internet access , short-range wireless communications ( infrared , Bluetooth ) , business applications , video games , and digital photography . Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones ; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones . The development of metal-oxide-semiconductor ( MOS ) large-scale integration ( LSI ) technology , information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications . The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973 , using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms ( 4.4 lbs ) . In 1979 , Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ( NTT ) launched the world 's first cellular network in Japan . [ citation needed ] In 1983 , the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone . From 1983 to 2014 , worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion - enough to provide one for every person on Earth . In first quarter of 2016 , the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung , Apple , and Huawei , and smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales . For feature phones ( slang : dumbphones ) as of 2016 [ update ] , the largest were Samsung , Nokia , and Alcatel .",

  "/wiki/IOS": "iOS ( formerly iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware . It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company 's mobile devices , including the iPhone , and iPod Touch ; it also powered the iPad prior to the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 . It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android . Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone , iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch ( September 2007 ) and the iPad ( January 2010 ) . As of March 2018 [ update ] , Apple 's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications , 1 million of which are native for iPads . These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times . The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures . Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually .",

  "/wiki/Android_(operating_system)": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software , designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets . Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance , with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google . Initially developed by Android Inc. , which Google bought in 2005 , Android was unveiled in 2007 , with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008 . The current stable version is Android 10 , released on September 3 , 2019 . The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) , which is primarily licensed under the Apache License . This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics , such as game consoles , digital cameras , PCs and others , each with a specialized user interface . Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables , both developed by Google . Android 's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems , most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services ( GMS ) , that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices . This includes core apps such as Gmail , the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform , and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser . These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google . Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com 's Fire OS , or LineageOS . Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store , or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid , which use software packages in the APK format .",
