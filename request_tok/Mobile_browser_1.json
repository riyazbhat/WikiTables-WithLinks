As such , it allows re-licensing . MPL software can thus be converted into a copyleft license such as the GPL , or to a proprietary license ( example : KaiOS ) . It has undergone two revisions , a minor update to version 1.1 , and a major update to version 2.0 with the goals of greater simplicity and better compatibility with other licenses . The MPL is the license for Mozilla Firefox , Mozilla Thunderbird , and most other Mozilla software , but it has been used by others , such as Adobe to license their Flex product line , and The Document Foundation to license LibreOffice 4.0 ( also on LGPL 3+ ) .

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF .

However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License .

It aimed to provide a consistent browsing experience on desktops and mobile devices , to display content on the small mobile displays in the same layout as larger displays , and to avoid the need to recode the web-page for small displays . When a page was opened , it appeared zoomed-out and shrunk , and formatted as would be in a desktop browser . The user could zoom into the certain areas of the page by using a selection rectangle , and pan the zoomed-in page . Deepfish consisted of a light-weight browser client powered by a server backend which does most of the processing . The server streams only the data that is visible at any moment , which improves load times and responsiveness . Despite the increased speed in Deepfish , it 's quite bandwidth heavy and can render pages slowly if it were launched on a device with lower specifications .

  "/wiki/HTML5": "HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it . HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) recommendation . The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors ( Apple , Google , Mozilla , and Microsoft ) , the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group ( WHATWG ) . HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008 , with a major update and W3C Recommendation status in October 2014 . Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features ; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers , parsers , etc. , without XHTML 's rigidity ; and to remain backward-compatible with older software . HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 , but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML . HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations ; it extends , improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents , and introduces markup and application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for complex web applications . For the same reasons , HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications , because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind . Many new syntactic features are included . To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content , the new < video > , < audio > and < canvas > elements were added , and support for scalable vector graphics ( SVG ) content and MathML for mathematical formulas . To enrich the semantic content of documents , new page structure elements such as < main > , < section > , < article > , < header > , < footer > , < aside > , < nav > , and < figure > are added . New attributes are introduced , some elements and attributes have been removed , and others such as < a > , < cite > , and < menu > have been changed , redefined , or standardized .",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) .
