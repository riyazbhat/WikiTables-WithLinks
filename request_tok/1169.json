  "/wiki/Space_Shuttle": "The Space Shuttle is a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) as part of the Space Shuttle program . Its official program name was Space Transportation System ( STS ) , taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development . The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 , leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 . In addition to the prototype whose completion was cancelled , five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 , launched from the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Florida . Operational missions launched numerous satellites , interplanetary probes , and the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ; conducted science experiments in orbit ; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station . The Shuttle fleet 's total mission time was 1322 days , 19 hours , 21 minutes and 23 seconds . Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines , a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) , and the expendable external tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . The Space Shuttle was launched vertically , like a conventional rocket , with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the ET . The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion , which used the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines . At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere . The orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing , usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center , Florida or Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base , California . After landing at Edwards , the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially modified Boeing 747 .",

  "/wiki/Magnum_(satellite)": "Magnum was a class of SIGINT spy satellites reportedly operated by the National Reconnaissance Office for the United States Central Intelligence Agency . The program remains classified , and the information that exists is speculative . It is believed that two Magnum satellites were launched from Space Shuttle Discovery during the missions STS-51-C in 1985 and STS-33 in 1989 . The satellites reportedly have a mass of 2,200-2,700 kg ( 4,900-6,000 lb ) , operating in near-geosynchronous orbits , using Inertial Upper Stages to get from the shuttle 's orbit to the higher geosynchronous orbit . According to Jim Slade of ABC News , the second satellite , USA-48 , replaced the first , USA-8 , which after more than 4 years in orbit was running out of maneuvering fuel required for keeping its station over the Indian Ocean . The mission of the two satellites was to listen in to military and diplomatic communications from the Soviet Union , China , and neighbouring countries . USA-67 , launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis in November 1990 ( the STS-38 mission ) , was initially identified as a third Magnum satellite owing to the presence of two upper stages in orbit after its deployment , suggesting that an IUS had been used to deploy it . It was later determined that the second upper stage was from the stealthy Prowler spacecraft , and that USA-67 was an SDS-2 communications satellite . The Magnum satellites , built by TRW , are rumored to have large ( estimated 100 m ( 330 ft ) diameter ) umbrella-like reflecting dishes to collect RF signals from Earth . The Magnum/Orion satellites replaced the older Rhyolite/Aquacade series of SIGINT satellites , and have themselves been succeeded by the Mentor/Advanced Orion satellites .",

The crew consisted of five NASA astronauts , one payload specialist , and a civilian schoolteacher . The mission carried the designation STS-51-L and was the tenth flight for the Challenger orbiter . The spacecraft disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean , off the coast of Cape Canaveral , Florida , at 11:39 a.m. EST ( 16:39 UTC ) . The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right solid rocket booster ( SRB ) failed at liftoff . The failure was caused by the failure of O-ring seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch . The seals ' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint , allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and external fuel tank . This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB 's aft field joint attachment and the structural failure of the external tank . Aerodynamic forces broke up the orbiter . The crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation . The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown ; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft .

Galileo arrived at Jupiter on December 7 , 1995 , after gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth , and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter . It launched the first probe into Jupiter , directly measuring its atmosphere . Despite suffering major antenna problems , Galileo achieved the first asteroid flyby , of 951 Gaspra , and discovered the first asteroid moon , Dactyl , around 243 Ida . In 1994 , Galileo observed Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 's collision with Jupiter . Jupiter 's atmospheric composition and ammonia clouds were recorded , the clouds possibly created by outflows from the lower depths of the atmosphere . Io 's volcanism and plasma interactions with Jupiter 's atmosphere were also recorded . The data Galileo collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean under the icy surface of Europa , and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto . Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto .

  "/wiki/Jupiter": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System . It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun , but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined . Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky , and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history . It is named after the Roman god Jupiter . When viewed from Earth , Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows , and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus . Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium , though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules . It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements , but like the other giant planets , Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface . Because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape is that of an oblate spheroid ( it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator ) . The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes , resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries . A prominent result is the Great Red Spot , a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope .

It was launched in 1990 and made three fast latitude scans of the Sun in 1994/1995 , 2000/2001 , and 2007/2008 . In addition , the probe studied several comets . Ulysses was a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) with participation from Canada 's National Research Council . The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30 , 2009 . To study the Sun at all latitudes , the probe needed to change its orbital inclination and leave the plane of the Solar System . To change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft to about 80\u00b0 requires a large change in heliocentric velocity , the energy to achieve which far exceeded the capabilities of any launch vehicle . To reach the desired orbit around the Sun , the mission 's planners chose a gravity assist maneuver around Jupiter , but this Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells . The probe was powered instead by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) . The spacecraft was originally named Odysseus , because of its lengthy and indirect trajectory to study the solar poles . It was renamed Ulysses , the Latin translation of Odysseus , at ESA 's request in honor not only of Homer 's mythological hero but also of Dante 's character in the Inferno .
