Empedocles ' philosophy is best known for originating the cosmogonic theory of the four classical elements . He also proposed forces he called Love and Strife which would mix and separate the elements , respectively . Influenced by Pythagoras ( died c. 495 BC ) and the Pythagoreans , Empedocles challenged the practice of animal sacrifice and killing animals for food . He developed a distinctive doctrine of reincarnation . He is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to have recorded his ideas in verse . Some of his work survives , more than is the case for any other pre-Socratic philosopher . Empedocles ' death was mythologized by ancient writers , and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments .",

It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana . Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea , south of the Italian Peninsula , from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina . Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna , the tallest active volcano in Europe , and one of the most active in the world , currently 3,329 m ( 10,922 ft ) high . The island has a typical Mediterranean climate . The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC . By around 750 BC , Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars . After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Byzantine Empire , and the Emirate of Sicily . The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily , which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen , the Capetian House of Anjou , Spain , and the House of Habsburg . It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand , a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification , and a plebiscite . Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946 , 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946 .",

However , unlike many other ancient secondary sources , Diogenes La\u00ebrtius generally reports philosophical teachings without attempting to reinterpret or expand on them , which means his accounts are often closer to the primary sources .

  "/wiki/Suicide": "Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one 's own death . Mental disorders , including depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , personality disorders , anxiety disorders , and substance abuse - including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines - are risk factors . Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress , such as from financial difficulties , relationship problems such as breakups , or bullying . Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts . Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide - such as firearms , drugs , and poisons ; treating mental disorders and substance misuse ; careful media reporting about suicide ; and improving economic conditions . Even though crisis hotlines are common , they have not been well studied . The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries , and is partly related to the availability of effective means . Common methods of suicide include hanging , pesticide poisoning , and firearms . Suicides resulted in 828,000 global deaths in 2015 , an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990 .

An officer in the republican army defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC , he was befriended by Octavian 's right-hand man in civil affairs , Maecenas , and became a spokesman for the new regime .

His original name was Mithradates ( alternative form Mithridates ) ; he assumed the name Antiochus after he ascended the throne.Notable events during the reign of Antiochus IV include his near-conquest of Egypt , his persecution of the Jews of Judea and Samaria , and the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees .

Seleucus received Babylonia ( 321 BC ) and from there expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander 's near-eastern territories . At the height of its power , the Empire included central Anatolia , Persia , the Levant , Mesopotamia , and what is now Kuwait , Afghanistan , and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan . The Seleucid Empire became a major center of Hellenistic culture - it maintained the preeminence of Greek customs where a Greek political elite dominated , mostly in the urban areas . The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by immigration from Greece . Seleucid attempts to defeat their old enemy Ptolemaic Egypt were frustrated by Roman demands . Having come into conflict in the east ( 305 BC ) with Chandragupta Maurya of the Maurya Empire , Seleucus I entered into an agreement with Chandragupta whereby he ceded vast territory west of the Indus , including the Hindu Kush , modern-day Afghanistan , and the Balochistan province of Pakistan and offered his daughter in marriage to the Maurya Emperor to formalize the alliance . Antiochus III the Great attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece , but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and by Greek allies such as the Kingdom of Pergamon , culminating in a Seleucid defeat at the 190 BC Battle of Magnesia . In the subsequent Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC , the Seleucids were compelled to pay costly war reparations and relinquished claims to territories west of the Taurus Mountains . The Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia conquered much of the remaining eastern part of the Seleucid Empire in the mid-2nd century BC , while the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom continued to flourish in the northeast .

It was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty , which started with Ptolemy I Soter 's accession after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and which ended with the death of Cleopatra and the Roman conquest in 30 BC . The Ptolemaic Kingdom was founded in 305 BC by Ptolemy I Soter , a diadochus originally from Macedon in northern Greece who declared himself pharaoh of Egypt and created a powerful Macedonian Greek dynasty that ruled an area stretching from southern Syria to Cyrene and south to Nubia . Scholars also argue that the kingdom was founded in 304 BC because of different use of calendars : Ptolemy crowned himself in 304 BC on the ancient Egyptian calendar , but in 305 BC on the ancient Macedonian calendar ; to resolve the issue , the year 305/4 was counted as the first year of Ptolemaic Kingdom in Demotic papyri . Alexandria , a Greek polis founded by Alexander the Great , became the capital city and a major center of Greek culture and trade . To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace , the Ptolemies named themselves as pharaohs . The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions by marrying their siblings per the Osiris myth , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participated in Egyptian religious life . The Ptolemies were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its final conquest by Rome . Their rivalry with the neighboring Seleucid Empire of West Asia led to a series of Syrian Wars in which both powers jockeyed for control of the Levant .

Most ancient Greeks recognized the twelve major Olympian gods and goddesses - Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , Demeter , Athena , Ares , Aphrodite , Apollo , Artemis , Hephaestus , Hermes , and either Hestia or Dionysus - although philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to assume a single transcendent deity . The worship of these deities , and several others , was found across the Greek world , though they often have different epithets that distinguished aspects of the deity , and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-Hellenic scheme . The religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece , to the islands and coasts of Ionia in Asia Minor , to Magna Graecia ( Sicily and southern Italy ) , and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean , such as Massalia ( Marseille ) .

Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory .

The Iron Age name of Samosata , Kummuh , probably gives its name to Commagene . Commagene has been characterized as a buffer state between Armenia , Parthia , Syria , and Rome ; culturally , it was correspondingly mixed . The kings of the Kingdom of Commagene claimed descent from Orontes with Darius I of Persia as their ancestor , by his marriage to Rhodogune , daughter of Artaxerxes II who had a family descent from king Darius I . The territory of Commagene corresponds roughly to the modern Turkish provinces of Ad\u0131yaman and northern Antep . Little is known of the region of Commagene prior to the beginning of the 2nd century BC . However , it seems that , from what little evidence remains , Commagene formed part of a larger state that also included the Kingdom of Sophene . This control lasted until c. 163 BC , when the local satrap , Ptolemaeus of Commagene , established himself as independent ruler following the death of the Seleucid king , Antiochus IV Epiphanes . The Kingdom of Commagene maintained its independence until 17 AD , when it was made a Roman province by Emperor Tiberius . It reemerged as an independent kingdom when Antiochus IV of Commagene was reinstated to the throne by order of Caligula , then deprived of it by that same emperor , then restored to it a couple of years later by his successor , Claudius . The re-emergent state lasted until 72 AD , when the Emperor Vespasian finally and definitively made it part of the Roman Empire . One of the kingdom 's most lasting visible remains is the archaeological site on Mount Nemrut , a sanctuary dedicated by King Antiochus Theos to a number of syncretistic Graeco-Iranian deities as well as to himself and the deified land of Commagene .",

It is written anonymously , although it identifies an unnamed disciple whom Jesus loved as the source of its traditions . The Gospel of John is closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles , and most scholars treat the four books , along with the Book of Revelation , as a single corpus of Johannine literature , albeit not from the same author . The discourses contained in this gospel seem to be concerned with issues of the church-synagogue debate at the time of composition . It is notable that in John , the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism , rather than as part of a wider Christian community . [ Notes 2 ] Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism , it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions .",

The act of simony , or paying for position and influence in the church , is named after Simon . According to Acts , Simon was a Samaritan magus or religious figure of the 1st century AD and a convert to Christianity , baptised by Philip the Evangelist . Simon later clashed with Peter . Accounts of Simon by writers of the second century exist , but are not considered verifiable . Surviving traditions about Simon appear in orthodox texts , such as those of Irenaeus , Justin Martyr , Hippolytus , and Epiphanius , where he is often described as the founder of Gnosticism , which has been accepted by some modern scholars , while others reject that he was a Gnostic , just designated as one by the Church Fathers . Justin , who was himself a 2nd-century native of Samaria , wrote that nearly all the Samaritans in his time were adherents of a certain Simon of Gitta , a village not far from Flavia Neapolis . According to Josephus , Gitta ( also spelled Getta ) was settled by the tribe of Dan . Irenaeus held him as being the founder of the sect of the Simonians . Hippolytus quotes from a work he attributes to Simon or his followers the Simonians , Apophasis Megale , or Great Declaration . According to the early church heresiologists , Simon is also supposed to have written several lost treatises , two of which bear the titles The Four Quarters of the World and The Sermons of the Refuter . In apocryphal works including the Acts of Peter , Pseudo-Clementines , and the Epistle of the Apostles , Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will .",

Originating from Smyrna , now Izmir in Turkey , he had seen and heard the preaching of Polycarp , the last known living connection with the Apostles , who in turn was said to have heard John the Evangelist . Chosen as bishop of Lugdunum , now Lyon , his best-known work is Against Heresies , often cited as Adversus Haereses , an attack on gnosticism , in particular that of Valentinus . To counter the doctrines of the gnostic sects claiming secret wisdom , he offered three pillars of orthodoxy : the scriptures , the tradition handed down from the apostles , and the teaching of the apostles ' successors . Intrinsic to his writing is that the surest source of Christian guidance is the church of Rome , and he is the earliest surviving witness to regard all four of the now-canonical gospels as essential . He is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church , which celebrates his feast on 28 June , and in the Eastern Orthodox Church , which celebrates the feast on 23 August .",

The rule of Ismail is one of the most vital in the history of Iran . Before his accession in 1501 , Iran , since its conquest by the Arabs eight-and-a-half centuries before , had not existed as a unified country under native Iranian rule , but had been controlled by a series of Arab caliphs , Turkic sultans , and Mongol khans . Although many Iranian dynasties rose to power amidst this whole period , it was only under the Buyids that a vast part of Iran proper came under Iranian rule ( 945-1055 ) . The dynasty founded by Ismail I would rule for over two centuries , being one of the greatest Iranian empires and at its height being amongst the most powerful empires of its time , ruling all of present-day Iran , Azerbaijan Republic , Armenia , most of Georgia , the North Caucasus , Iraq , Kuwait and Afghanistan , as well as parts of modern-day Syria , Turkey , Pakistan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan . It also reasserted the Iranian identity in large parts of Greater Iran . The legacy of the Safavid Empire was also the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West , the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy , its architectural innovations and its patronage for fine arts . One of his first actions , was the proclamation of the Twelver sect of Shia Islam to be the official religion of his newly-formed state , which had major consequences for the ensuing history of Iran . Furthermore , this drastic act also gave him a political benefit of separating the growing Safavid state from its strong Sunni neighbors - the Ottoman Empire to the west and the Uzbek confederation to the east . However , it brought into the Iranian body politic the implied inevitability of consequent conflict between the shah , the design of a secular state , and the religious leaders , who saw all secular states as unlawful and whose absolute ambition was a theocratic state . Ismail was also a prolific poet who , under the pen name Kha\u1e6d\u0101\u02be\u012b ( which means he who made a mistake or he who was wrong in Persian ) , contributed greatly to the literary development of the Azerbaijani language .

Led by Hong Xiuquan , the self-proclaimed brother of Jesus Christ , the goals of the Taipings were religious , nationalist , and political in nature ; they sought the conversion of the Chinese people to the Taiping 's syncretic version of Christianity , the overthrow of the ruling Manchus , and a wholesale transformation and reformation of the state . Rather than simply supplanting the ruling class , the Taipings sought to upend the moral and social order of China . To that end , they established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as an oppositional state based in Tianjing ( present-day Nanjing ) and gained control of a significant part of southern China , eventually expanding to command a population base of nearly 30 million people . For over a decade , the Taiping occupied and fought across much of the mid and lower Yangtze valley . Ultimately devolving into total war , the conflict between the Taiping and the Qing was the largest in China since the Qing conquest in 1644 and it involved every province of China proper except Gansu . It ranks as one of the bloodiest wars in human history , the bloodiest civil war , and the largest conflict of the 19th century . Estimates of the war dead range from 10-30 million . 30 million people fled the conquered regions to foreign settlements or other parts of China . Severely weakened by an attempted coup and unable to capture the Qing capital of Beijing , the Taipings were ultimately defeated by decentralized , irregular armies such as the Xiang Army commanded by Zeng Guofan .

He was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry , resulting in several publications . Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life . In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India . He married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honeymooned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who provided him with The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema . Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus , The Book declared that its followers should Do what thou wilt and seek to align themselves with their True Will through the practice of magick . After an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga and a visit to India and China , Crowley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature . In 1907 , he and George Cecil Jones co-founded an esoteric order , the A\u2234A\u2234 , through which they propagated Thelema .",
  "/wiki/Thelema": "Thelema ( /\u03b8\u0259\u02c8li\u02d0m\u0259/ ) is a social or spiritual philosophy developed in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley , an English writer , mystic , and ceremonial magician . The word thelema is the English transliteration of the Koine Greek noun \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 ( pronounced [ \u03b8\u00e9l\u025b : ma ] ) , will , from the verb \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 ( eth\u00e9l\u014d ) : to will , wish , want or purpose . While Thelema is most often regarded as a religion it is also often called a philosophy . Crowley believed himself to be the prophet of a new age , the \u00c6on of Horus , based upon a spiritual experience that he and his wife , Rose Edith , had in Egypt in 1904 . By his account , a possibly non-corporeal or praeterhuman being that called itself Aiwass contacted him through Rose and dictated , through Rose , a text known as The Book of the Law or Liber AL vel Legis , which outlined the principles of Thelema . The Thelemic pantheon - a collection of gods and goddesses who either literally exist or serve as symbolic archetypes or metaphors , depending on one 's viewpoint - includes a number of deities , primarily a trio adapted from ancient Egyptian religion , who are the three speakers of The Book of the Law : Nuit , Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit . Crowley described these deities as a literary convenience . The religion is founded on the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus , in which a new ethical code would be followed : Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law . This means that adherents of Thelema should seek out and follow their true path , i.e . their True Will . The philosophy also emphasizes the ritual practice of Magick . As Crowley developed the religion , he wrote widely on the topic , as well as producing more inspired writings that he collectively termed The Holy Books of Thelema .",

The word is from a Proto-Semitic archaic biliteral \u0294-L meaning god ( possibly with a wider meaning of strong ) , which was extended to a regular triliteral by the addition of a h ( as in Hebrew \u02beel\u014dah , \u02beel\u014dhim ) .

  "/wiki/Adam_and_Eve": "Adam and Eve , according to the creation myth of the Abrahamic religions , were the first man and woman . They are central to the belief that humanity is in essence a single family , with everyone descended from a single pair of original ancestors . It also provides the basis for the doctrines of the fall of man and original sin that are important beliefs in Christianity , although not held in Judaism or Islam . In the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible , chapters one through five , there are two creation narratives with two distinct perspectives . In the first , Adam and Eve are not named . Instead , God created humankind in God 's image and instructed them to multiply and to be stewards over everything else that God had made . In the second narrative , God fashions Adam from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden . Adam is told that he can eat freely of all the trees in the garden , except for a tree of the knowledge of good and evil . Subsequently , Eve is created from one of Adam 's ribs to be his companion . They are innocent and unembarrassed about their nakedness . However , a serpent deceives Eve into eating fruit from the forbidden tree , and she gives some of the fruit to Adam .

  "/wiki/Avatar": "An avatar ( Sanskrit : \u0905\u0935\u0924\u093e\u0930 , IAST : avat\u0101ra ) , a concept in Hinduism that means descent , is the material appearance or incarnation of a deity on earth . The relative verb to alight , to make one 's appearance is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being . The word avatar does not appear in the Vedic literature , however it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature , and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE . Despite that , the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism . The Rigveda describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will . The Bhagavad Gita expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than avatar . Theologically , the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu , though the idea has been applied to other deities . Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures , including the ten Dashavatara of the Garuda Purana and the twenty-two avatars in the Bhagavata Purana , though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable . The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology . In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism , avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari , Durga and Kali are commonly found . While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts , this is minor and occasional . The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism .",
  "/wiki/Dattatreya": "Dattatreya , Datt\u0101 or Dattaguru or Duttatreya , is a God and paradigmatic Sannyasi ( monk ) and one of the lords of Yoga in Hinduism . In many regions of India and Nepal , he is considered a deity . In Maharashtra , Goa , Karnataka and Gujarat , Dattatreya is considered to be an avatar ( incarnation ) of the three Hindu gods Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva , collectively known as Trimurti . In other regions , and some versions of texts such as Garuda Purana , Brahma Purana and Sattvata Samhita , he is an avatar of Maha Vishnu . In Dasam Granth , he is considered as Rudra Avtar . His iconography varies regionally . In western Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh , for example , he is typically shown with three heads and six hands , one head each for Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva , and one pair of hands holding the symbolic items associated with each member of the Trimurti : The jaapmaala and water pot of Brahma , the conch and sudarshana chakra ( discus ) of Vishnu , and the trishula ( trident ) and two headed drum of Shiva . He is popularly depicted as a reclusive and ascetical saadhu living in a forest or wilderness , suggestive of his renunciation of worldly comforts and possessions , and pursuit of a meditative yogi lifestyle . In paintings and some large carvings , he is surrounded by four dogs and a cow , the dogs are not symbols for the four Vedas but Duttaguru 's teaching of similitude and equality among all creatures especially animals , right from the pure and holy cow to the dog , the least and lowest of lifeforms in Hindu thought ; this exegesis was put forward by a charismatic personality , the avtari purush ( godman ) of the Dattatreya lineage , Shri Ramakrishna Saraswati Kshirsagar Swamiji of Ambikapur ( Ahmednagar ) . The cow is adored and reverenced mainly in North India as a symbol of the Mother Earth who nourishes all living beings . In the temples of southern Maharashtra , Varanasi ( Benares ) , and the Himalayas , his iconography shows him with one head and two hands , with four dogs and a cow . According to Rigopoulos , in the Nath tradition of Shaivism , Dattatreya is revered as the Adi-Guru ( First Teacher ) of the Adinath Sampradaya of the Nathas , the first Lord of Yoga with mastery of Tantra ( techniques ) , although most traditions and scholars consider Adi Nath an epithet of Shiva ."
