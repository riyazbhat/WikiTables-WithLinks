Poltergeist : The Legacy debuted on Showtime , and all first-run episodes of the first three seasons premiered on that network , though they were later syndicated . After the third season , Showtime cancelled the show , and the rights were purchased by Sci Fi Channel which continued the series for another season . This same pattern was followed by Stargate SG-1 , which also debuted on Showtime , was also sold into syndication , and was rescued from cancellation by Sci Fi . The fourth season of Poltergeist : The Legacy featured an episode starring WWE wrestler The Undertaker as a being from Hell who collected souls , a deliberate [ original research ? ] crossover with RAW , which was also airing on the USA Network at the time and earning the network some of the highest ratings on cable TV .

In 2009 Poltergeist : The Legacy aired on NBC Universal 's horror and suspense-themed cable channel Chiller . As of 2016 , the program airs in primetime on digital network Comet .",
