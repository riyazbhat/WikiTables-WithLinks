  "/wiki/Convertibles": "A convertible , cabriolet or spyder/spider ( /\u02cck\u00e6brio\u028a\u02c8le\u026a/ ) is a passenger car that can be driven with or without a roof in place . The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary between models . A convertible allows an open-air driving experience , with the ability to provide a roof when required . Potential drawbacks of convertibles are reduced structural rigidity ( requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car 's roof ) and cargo space . The majority of convertible roofs are a folding construction made from cloth . Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops ( often constructed from metal or plastic ) and detachable hardtops ( where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk ) .",
