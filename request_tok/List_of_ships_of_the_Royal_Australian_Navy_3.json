  "/wiki/HMAS_Balikpapan_(L_126)": "HMAS Balikpapan ( L 126 ) was the lead ship of the Balikpapan class of heavy landing craft ( LCH ) . Ordered in 1969 , Balikpapan entered service with the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron in late 1971 . After this , the decision to place all seagoing Army vessels under the control of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) saw Balikpapan transferred and commissioned in 1974 ; the last of the eight-vessel class to enter RAN service . Balikpapan was placed in reserve in 1985 , but was reactivated three years later . During late 1999 and early 2000 , the vessel was part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce , and made additional deployments to East Timor in 2001 and 2006 . On 12 December 2012 , Balikpapan was retired from RAN service .",
  "/wiki/Balikpapan-class_landing_craft_heavy": "The Balikpapan class is a ship class of eight heavy landing craft ( officially Landing Craft , Heavy or LCH ) . All eight were originally laid down by Walkers Limited for the Australian Army in the early 1970s . A reorganisation of watercraft responsibilities in the Australian military meant the landing craft were to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , with seven commissioned directly into RAN service during 1973 and 1974 , and lead ship Balikpapan transferred from the army to the navy . During the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975 , two of the vessels ( Salamaua and Buna ) were transferred to the new Papua New Guinea Defence Force ( PNGDF ) . During their careers , the Australian vessels have operated in support of Operation Navy Help Darwin in 1974-75 , Operation Bel Isi from 1997 to 2003 , INTERFET operations in 1999 and 2000 , and RAMSI operations from 2003 . The six remaining RAN vessels were paid off in the 2010s : Balikpapan , Betano , and Wewak in 2012 ; Brunei , Labuan , and Tarakan in 2014 . They are yet to be replaced in RAN service . As of 2013 , the two PNGDF vessels were active , and in 2014 , the former Labuan was transferred to Papua New Guinea as the training ship Lakekamu . Brunei and Tarakan were refitted and donated to the Philippine Navy in 2015 , commissioning as Ivatan and Batak . Three additional units of the class - decommissioned units former HMAS Balikpapan , HMAS Wewak and HMAS Betano - were loaded on a transport ship in March 2016 for transport to the Philippine Navy .",

  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",

In 1990 , the RAN purchased the vessels for conversion into auxiliary minesweepers under the Craft of Opportunity Program ( COOP ) . The vessels could be equipped with a sidescan sonar and various towed minesweeping arrays , and also functioned as berthing tugs . Both vessels were placed in reserve in 2010 , but were deployed on several occasions since to provide berthing support to nuclear-powered warships . They were removed from naval service in 2014 .",

  "/wiki/River-class_frigate": "The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic . The majority served with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , with some serving in the other Allied navies : the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , the Free French Navy ( FFN ) , the Royal Netherlands Navy and , post-war , the South African Navy ( SAN ) . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters . One , HMCS Stormont , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht Christina O .",
