  "/wiki/John_Gilpin": "John Gilpin ( 18th century ) was featured as the subject in a well-known comic ballad of 1782 by William Cowper , entitled The Diverting History of John Gilpin . Cowper had heard the story from his friend Lady Austen . Gilpin was said to be a wealthy draper from Cheapside in London , who owned land at Olney , Buckinghamshire , near where Cowper lived . It is likely that he was a Mr Beyer , a linen draper of the Cheapside corner of Paternoster Row . The poem tells how Gilpin and his wife and children became separated during a journey to the Bell Inn , Edmonton , after Gilpin loses control of his horse , and is carried ten miles farther to the town of Ware .",

She was best known for her performances of songs such as The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery , My Old Man ( Said Follow the Van ) and Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do .

She starred in a further two productions at the theatre , Little Bo Peep ( 1892 ) and Robinson Crusoe ( 1893 ) . By the mid-1890s , Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain 's theatre censors due to the risqu\u00e9 content of her songs . Between 1894 and 1900 , she became an international success when she toured France , America , Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act . In 1907 , she assisted other performers during the music hall war and took part in demonstrations outside theatres , protesting for better pay and conditions for performers .

  "/wiki/John_Keats": "John Keats ( /ki\u02d0ts/ ; 31 October 1795 - 23 February 1821 ) was an English Romantic poet . He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets , along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley , despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25 . Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime , his reputation grew after his death , and by the end of the 19th century , he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets . He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers . Jorge Luis Borges stated that his first encounter with Keats ' work was the most significant literary experience of his life . The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery , most notably in the series of odes . This is typical of romantic poets , as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through an emphasis on natural imagery . Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature . Some of the most acclaimed works of Keats are Ode to a Nightingale , Sleep and Poetry , and the famous sonnet On First Looking into Chapman 's Homer .",
