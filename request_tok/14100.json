  "/wiki/John_Keats": "John Keats ( /ki\u02d0ts/ ; 31 October 1795 - 23 February 1821 ) was an English Romantic poet . He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets , along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley , despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25 . Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime , his reputation grew after his death , and by the end of the 19th century , he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets . He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers . Jorge Luis Borges stated that his first encounter with Keats ' work was the most significant literary experience of his life . The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery , most notably in the series of odes . This is typical of romantic poets , as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through an emphasis on natural imagery . Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature . Some of the most acclaimed works of Keats are Ode to a Nightingale , Sleep and Poetry , and the famous sonnet On First Looking into Chapman 's Homer .",
