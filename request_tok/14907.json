It aroused a great sensation at the time , and caused a storm of outraged controversy that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society . In 2006 , the centennial of Ibsen 's death , A Doll 's House held the distinction of being the world 's most performed play that year .

The title of the play is most commonly translated as A Doll 's House , though some scholars use A Doll House .
