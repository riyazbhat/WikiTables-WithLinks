  "/wiki/Operating_system": "An operating system ( OS ) is system software that manages computer hardware , software resources , and provides common services for computer programs . Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time , mass storage , printing , and other resources . For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation , the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware , although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it . Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers . The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74% . macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place ( 13.23% ) , and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place ( 1.57% ) . In the mobile ( including smartphones and tablets ) sector , Google Android 's share is up to 70% in the year 2017 . According to third quarter 2016 data , Android 's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year , followed by Apple 's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent , while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent . Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors . Other specialized classes of operating systems , such as embedded and real-time systems , exist for many applications .",

  "/wiki/Pinball": "Pinball is a type of arcade game , in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more metallic balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine . The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible . Many modern pinball machines include a storyline where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story , usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game . Different numbers of points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field . A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field , partially protected by player-controlled paddles called flippers . A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times . Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing ( by earning extra balls and keeping the ball in play as long as possible ) , and to earn bonus credits by achieving a high enough score or through other means .",

An updated version of Windows 2000 was also originally planned for the business market ; however , in January 2000 , both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed Whistler , which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets . As such , Windows XP was the first consumer edition of Windows not to be based on MS-DOS . Upon its release , Windows XP received critical acclaim , with critics noting increased performance and stability ( especially in comparison to Windows Me , the previous version of Windows aimed at home users ) , a more intuitive user interface , improved hardware support , and expanded multimedia capabilities . However , some industry reviewers were concerned by the new licensing model and product activation system . Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8 , 2014 , after which the operating system ceased receiving further support or security updates ( with exceptional security updates being made e.g . in 2019 , to address potential ransomware threats ) to most users . By August 2019 , Microsoft ( and others ) had ended support for games on Windows XP .

It is the replacement for Microsoft 's earlier Video for Windows technology . Based on the Microsoft Windows Component Object Model ( COM ) framework , DirectShow provides a common interface for media across various programming languages , and is an extensible , filter-based framework that can render or record media files on demand at the request of the user or developer . The DirectShow development tools and documentation were originally distributed as part of the DirectX SDK . Currently , they are distributed as part of the Windows SDK ( formerly known as the Platform SDK ) . Microsoft plans to completely replace DirectShow gradually with Media Foundation in future Windows versions . One reason cited by Microsoft is to provide much more robust support for content protection systems ( see digital rights management ) . Microsoft 's Becky Weiss also confirms that you 'll notice that working with the Media Foundation requires you to work at a slightly lower level than working with DirectShow would have . And there are still DirectShow features that are n't ( yet ) in Media Foundation .

Windows Live Mail is designed to run on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 , but is also compatible with Windows 8 and Windows 10 , even though Microsoft bundles a new email client , named Windows Mail , with the latter . Since around 2013 , serious problems with Windows Live Mail 2012 ( but not with Windows Live Mail 2011 ) have been reported on various blog sites ( including Microsoft forums ) . One problem is that deleted emails keep returning day after day . Another development that caused complaints is the Live Mail Sent folder erroneously containing the name of the Sender rather than the Recipient in the To column , while omitting the sender 's account name in the Account column ( as the fault only affects that folder , a workaround is to move sent items into a new folder , named - for example - Sent 2019 ) . Discussions on the forums have provided no clear solutions to these issues . Windows Live Mail moved away from the older Microsoft mail programs , such as Outlook Express , which stored all e-mails comprising a folder ( such as the Inbox ) in a single .dbx file . In order to provide greater flexibility ( and to avoid the problem where corruption of a single .dbx file could delete multiple emails ) , Windows Live Mail stores each email message as a separate .eml file . Only the folder structure is maintained in a single database file , using the ESE ( Extensible Storage Engine ) database structure , named Mail.MSMessageStore ( which also holds some metadata for each .eml file on the system , so can be a huge file ) . The program also maintains a backup copy of that file , in the Backup sub-folder , so problems are rare . At a pinch , the Mail.MSMessageStore file can be recreated from the data in the .eml files .",

  "/wiki/Chess": "Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8\u00d78 grid . The game is played by millions of people worldwide . Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7th century . Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi ( Chinese chess ) , janggi ( Korean chess ) , and shogi ( Japanese chess ) . Chess reached Europe by the 9th century , due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania . The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century ; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century . Play involves no hidden information . Each player begins with 16 pieces : one king , one queen , two rooks , two knights , two bishops , and eight pawns . Each piece type moves differently , with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn . The objective is to checkmate [ note 1 ] the opponent 's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture . To this end , a player 's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent 's pieces , while supporting each other . During the game , play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent 's similar pieces , and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position .",

On January 30 , 2007 , it was released worldwide and was made available for purchase and download from the Windows Marketplace ; it is the first release of Windows to be made available through a digital distribution platform . The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor , Windows XP , the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems . New features of Windows Vista include an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Aero , a new search component called Windows Search , redesigned networking , audio , print and display sub-systems , and new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker . Vista aimed to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network , using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices . Windows Vista included version 3.0 of the .NET Framework , allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs . Microsoft 's primary stated objective with Windows Vista was to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system . One common criticism of Windows XP and its predecessors was their commonly exploited security vulnerabilities and overall susceptibility to malware , viruses and buffer overflows . In light of this , Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced in early 2002 a company-wide Trustworthy Computing initiative , which aimed to incorporate security into every aspect of software development at the company . Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above finishing Windows Vista , thus delaying its completion .

Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows 7 on January 13 , 2015 and extended support ended on January 14 , 2020 . Windows 7 was primarily intended to be an incremental upgrade to Microsoft Windows , addressing Windows Vista 's poor critical reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility . Windows 7 continued improvements on Windows Aero ( the user interface introduced in Windows Vista ) with the addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows applications to be pinned to it , and new window management features . Other new features were added to the operating system , including libraries , the new file sharing system HomeGroup , and support for multitouch input . A new Action Center interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information , and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive . Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications , including Internet Explorer 8 , Windows Media Player , and Windows Media Center . In contrast to Windows Vista , Windows 7 was generally praised by critics , who considered the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor due to its increased performance , its more intuitive interface ( with particular praise devoted to the new taskbar ) , fewer User Account Control popups , and other improvements made across the platform . Windows 7 was a major success for Microsoft ; even prior to its official release , pre-order sales for the operating system on the online retailer Amazon.com had surpassed previous records .

Collectively , MS-DOS , its rebranding as IBM PC DOS , and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS , are sometimes referred to as DOS ( which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system ) . MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s , from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system . IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 , as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs . Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM , the two products diverged after twelve years , in 1993 , with recognizable differences in compatibility , syntax , and capabilities . During its lifetime , several competing products were released for the x86 platform , and MS-DOS went through eight versions , until development ceased in 2000 . Initially , MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system , but application software and user data as well . Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats , along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures . Ultimately , it was the key product in Microsoft 's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm , providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources .

It is the successor to Windows 8.1 , and was released to manufacturing on July 15 , 2015 , and broadly released for retail sale on July 29 , 2015 . Windows 10 receives new builds on an ongoing basis , which are available at no additional cost to users , in addition to additional test builds of Windows 10 which are available to Windows Insiders . Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace , or use long-term support milestones that only receive critical updates , such as security patches , over their ten-year lifespan of extended support . One of Windows 10 's most notable features is its support for universal apps , an expansion of the Metro-style apps first introduced in Windows 8 . Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code\u200d - \u200cincluding PCs , tablets , smartphones , embedded systems , Xbox One , Surface Hub and Mixed Reality . The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a touchscreen-optimized interface based on available input devices\u200d - \u200cparticularly on 2-in-1 PCs , both interfaces include an updated Start menu which incorporates elements of Windows 7 's traditional Start menu with the tiles of Windows 8 . Windows 10 also introduced the Microsoft Edge web browser , a virtual desktop system , a window and desktop management feature called Task View , support for fingerprint and face recognition login , new security features for enterprise environments , and DirectX 12 . Windows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in July 2015 . Critics praised Microsoft 's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows , contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8 , although Windows 10 's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8 . Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10 's bundled software over Windows 8.1 , Xbox Live integration , as well as the functionality and capabilities of the Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Edge . However , media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors , including mandatory update installation , privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release .",

Points are awarded for putting colored balls in the correct hole , time left at the end of the round , and for breaking blocks . The game is over when time runs out , or when a ball enters a hole of the wrong color . However , gray is a neutral color and therefore if a gray ball goes into the hole of a different color or if any ball goes into a gray hole nothing will happen .

InkBall has a variety of difficulty levels , ranging from Beginner , to Novice , to Intermediate , to Advanced and finally to Expert . As the difficulty increases , the time to move the balls into their correct hole ( s ) is dramatically lowered , and the overall complexity of the task increases substantially .",

Some versions of Minesweeper will set up the board by never placing a mine on the first square revealed . Minesweeper for versions of Windows protects the first square revealed ; from Windows 7 onward , players may elect to replay a board , in which the game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square . If a square containing a mine is revealed , the player loses the game . If no mine is revealed , a digit is instead displayed in the square , indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines ; if no mines are adjacent , the square becomes blank , and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed . The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares , and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine .",
