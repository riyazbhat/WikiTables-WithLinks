He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history . His films , which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories , cover a wide range of genres , and are noted for their realism , dark humor , unique cinematography , extensive set designs , and evocative use of music . Kubrick was raised in the Bronx , New York City , and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945 . He received average grades , but displayed a keen interest in literature , photography , and film from a young age , and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school . After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s , he began making short films on a shoestring budget , and made his first major Hollywood film , The Killing , for United Artists in 1956 . This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas , the war picture Paths of Glory ( 1957 ) and the historical epic Spartacus ( 1960 ) . His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew , and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ) , though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself . Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios , a dislike of the Hollywood industry , and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career . His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife Christiane , became his workplace , where he did his writing , research , editing , and management of production details .

  "/wiki/Animation_film": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize .

  "/wiki/The_Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin_(1957_film)": "The Pied Piper of Hamelin is an American ninety-minute musical film in color , originally made as a television special and first shown by NBC on Tuesday , November 26 , 1957 , as one of their Thanksgiving Week offerings for that year . It preempted that evening 's telecasts of The Nat King Cole Show and The Eddie Fisher Show . Based on the famous poem of the same name by Robert Browning and using the music of Edvard Grieg arranged by Pete King with special lyrics by Hal Stanley and Irving Taylor , it starred Van Johnson , Claude Rains ( in his only singing and dancing role ) , Lori Nelson , Jim Backus , and Kay Starr . It was directed by Broadway veteran Bretaigne Windust . In a direct nod to Browning 's poem , nearly all of the dialogue in The Pied Piper of Hamelin was written in rhyme , much of it directly lifted from the poem . Unusually for a made-for-TV family special of the era , it was not presented live but on actual motion picture film , and the color process used was not NBC 's usual living color , but three-strip Technicolor , which had previously been used on television only in the one-hour science specials Our Mr. Sun and Hemo the Magnificent . Theatrical prints , however , erroneously bill the film as having been made in Eastman Color . The program was successful enough it spawned an LP record album and was repeated on NBC in 1958 . It was then syndicated to many local stations , where it was rerun annually for many years , in the tradition of other holiday specials . The film was briefly released to movie theatres in 1966 , where it did not fare nearly as well . Years later , Van Johnson 's performance as the Pied Piper was still so fondly remembered that he played a Piper-like criminal called The Minstrel on the 1966 TV series Batman",
