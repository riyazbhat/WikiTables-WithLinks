In addition to the Olympics , she won five gold medals at the World Championships .

Kostelic 's accomplishments in professional skiing have led some commentators , writers , and fellow ski racers to regard her as the greatest female ski racer of all time . Kosteli\u0107 is the only woman to win four gold medals in alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics ( in 2002 and 2006 ) , and the only woman to win three alpine skiing gold medals in one Olympics ( 2002 ) .

On 15 January 2006 , Kosteli\u0107 became the third woman in World Cup history ( after Swede Pernilla Wiberg and Austrian Petra Kronberger ) to win World Cup races in all of the sport 's five disciplines . On 5 February 2006 Kosteli\u0107 became the second female skier ( after Petra Kronberger ) to win all five disciplines in one season . In the summer of 2006 , she decided to not compete in the 2007 season , due to chronic knee and back pain . She had endured ten knee surgeries and thyroid surgery during her career .

The opening ceremony was held on February 8 , 2002 , and sporting competitions were held up until the closing ceremony on February 24 , 2002 . Production for both ceremonies was designed by Seven Nielsen , and music for both ceremonies was directed by Mark Watters . Salt Lake City became the most populous area ever to have hosted the Winter Olympics , although the two subsequent host cities ' populations were larger . Following a trend , the 2002 Olympic Winter Games were also larger than all prior Winter Games , with 10 more events than the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . Norway won the most gold medals while Germany won the most number of medals . The Salt Lake Games faced a bribery scandal and some local opposition during the bid . Nevertheless , from sporting and business standpoints , this was one of the most successful Winter Olympiads in history ; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs .",

Miller , the leader after the downhill portion , was disqualified in the first slalom run for straddling a gate . This left Raich in the lead going into the final run of slalom , followed by Ivica Kosteli\u0107 and young American Ted Ligety . Ligety scorched the final run for the gold medal , while Raich skied out . Aamodt did not start the event after a knee injury , and Filip Trejbal had to withdraw after a spectacular crash which delayed the event for a prolonged period .
