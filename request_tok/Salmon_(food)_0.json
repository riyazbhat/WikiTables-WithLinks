  "/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)": "Curing is any of various food preservation and flavoring processes of foods such as meat , fish and vegetables , by the addition of salt , with the aim of drawing moisture out of the food by the process of osmosis . Because curing increases the solute concentration in the food and hence decreases its water potential , the food becomes inhospitable for the microbe growth that causes food spoilage . Curing can be traced back to antiquity , and was the primary method of preserving meat and fish until the late-19th century . Dehydration was the earliest form of food curing . Many curing processes also involve smoking , spicing , cooking , or the addition of combinations of sugar , nitrate , and nitrite .",

The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk . The genus Allium also contains the onion , garlic , shallot , scallion , chive , and Chinese onion . Historically , many scientific names were used for leeks , but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum . The name 'leek ' developed from the Old English word leac , from which the modern English name of garlic also derives . Three closely related vegetables , elephant garlic , kurrat and Persian leek or tareh , are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum , although different in their uses as food .",
  "/wiki/Lomi_salmon": "Lomi salmon ( more commonly known as lomi-lomi salmon ) is a side dish in Hawaiian cuisine . It is a fresh tomato and salmon salad , and was introduced to Hawaiians by early Western sailors . It is typically prepared by mixing salted , shredded salmon with tomatoes , sweet gentle Maui onions , and occasionally scallions , and sometimes crushed ice if it is not refrigerated . It is always served cold . The name lomi-lomi salmon is taken from the method of preparation . The shredding ( dicing ) and mixing of the salmon is done by massaging the salted fish with other ingredients by hand ( lomi-lomi is Hawaiian for to massage ) . Lomi-lomi salmon is a traditional side dish served at Hawaiian l\u016baus . It is said to complement traditional Hawaiian food consisting of raw diced ahi tuna , poke , kalua pig , laulau , and poi . Lomi-lomi salmon is a classic and integral part of most Hawaiian parties and gatherings , such as traditional luaus , and can be considered a Hawaiian ethnic food .",

  "/wiki/Fish_fillet": "A fish fillet , from the French word filet ( pronounced [ fil\u025b ] ) meaning a thread or strip , is the flesh of a fish which has been cut or sliced away from the bone by cutting lengthwise along one side of the fish parallel to the backbone . In preparation for filleting , any scales on the fish should be removed . The contents of the stomach also need careful detaching from the fillet . Because fish fillets do not contain the larger bones running along the vertebrae , they are often said to be boneless . However , some species , such as the common carp , have smaller intramuscular bones called pins within the fillet . The skin present on one side may or may not be stripped from the fillet . Butterfly fillets can be produced by cutting the fillets on each side in such a way that they are held together by the flesh and skin of the belly . Fish fillets can be contrasted with fish steaks ( also known as fish cutlets ) , which are cut perpendicular to the spine and include the larger bones .",
  "/wiki/Bagel": "A bagel ( Yiddish : \u05d1\u05f2\u05d2\u05dc beygl ; Polish : bajgiel ) , also historically spelled beigel , is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland . It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough , roughly hand-sized , that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked . The result is a dense , chewy , doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior . Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust , with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds . Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface , and there are different dough types , such as whole-grain or rye . Bagels are eaten toasted or untoasted . Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure , it is known that they were widely consumed by Ashkenazi Jews from the 17th century . The first known mention of the bagel , in 1610 , was in Jewish community ordinances in Krak\u00f3w , Poland . Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America , especially in cities with a large Jewish population , many with alternative ways of making them . Like other bakery products , bagels are available ( fresh or frozen , often in many flavors ) in many major supermarkets in those cities . The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing more even cooking and baking of the dough : The hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels , allowing easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays .",
  "/wiki/Cream_cheese": "Cream cheese is a soft , usually mild-tasting fresh cheese made from milk and cream . Stabilizers such as carob bean gum and carrageenan are typically added in industrial production . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines cream cheese as containing at least 33% milk fat with a moisture content of not more than 55% , and a pH range of 4.4 to 4.9 . Similarly , under Canadian Food and Drug Regulations cream cheese must contain at least 30% milk fat and a maximum of 55% moisture . In other countries , it is defined differently and may need a considerably higher fat content . Cream cheese is not naturally matured and is meant to be consumed fresh , so it differs from other soft cheeses such as Brie and Neufch\u00e2tel . It is more comparable in taste , texture , and production methods to Boursin and mascarpone .",
  "/wiki/Onion": "The onion ( Allium cepa L. , from Latin cepa onion ) , also known as the bulb onion or common onion , is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium . Its close relatives include the garlic , shallot , leek , chive , and Chinese onion . This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food , such as the Japanese bunching onion ( Allium fistulosum ) , the tree onion ( A . \u00d7proliferum ) , and the Canada onion ( Allium canadense ) . The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species , but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation . Its ancestral wild original form is not known , although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions . The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant , but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season . The onion plant has a fan of hollow , bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached . The bulbs are composed of shortened , compressed , underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale ( leaves ) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem . In the autumn ( or in spring , in the case of overwintering onions ) , the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle . The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage . The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases , particularly the onion fly , the onion eelworm , and various fungi cause rotting .",
  "/wiki/Tomato": "The tomato is the edible , often red , berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum , commonly known as a tomato plant . The species originated in western South America and Central America . The Nahuatl ( Aztec language ) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate , from which the English word tomato derived . Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico . The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs , they brought the plant to Europe . From there , the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century . Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor . The tomato is consumed in diverse ways , raw or cooked , in many dishes , sauces , salads , and drinks . While tomatoes are fruits - botanically classified as berries - they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish . Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world , with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year . Tomato plants typically grow to 1-3 meters ( 3-10 ft ) in height . They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support .",
  "/wiki/Caper": "Capparis spinosa , the caper bush , also called Flinders rose , is a perennial plant that bears rounded , fleshy leaves and large white to pinkish-white flowers . The plant is best known for the edible flower buds ( capers ) , often used as a seasoning , and the fruit ( caper berries ) , both of which are usually consumed pickled . Other species of Capparis are also picked along with C. spinosa for their buds or fruits . Other parts of Capparis plants are used in the manufacture of medicines and cosmetics . Capparis spinosa is native to the Mediterranean . It is native to almost all the circum-Mediterranean countries , and is included in the flora of most of them , but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain . The family Capparaceae could have originated in the tropics , and later spread to the Mediterranean basin . The taxonomic status of the species is controversial and unsettled . Species within the genus Capparis are highly variable , and interspecific hybrids have been common throughout the evolutionary history of the genus . As a result , some authors have considered C. spinosa to be composed of multiple distinct species , others that the taxon is a single species with multiple varieties or subspecies , or that the taxon C. spinosa is a hybrid between C. orientalis and C. sicula .",

  "/wiki/Fishcake": "A fishcake ( sometimes written as fish cake ) is a culinary dish consisting of filleted fish or other seafood minced or ground , mixed with a starchy food , and fried . Asian-style fishcakes usually contain fish with salt , water , flour and egg . Fish cakes can be made by the combination of fish paste and surimi . The combined product is then shaped and left to cool . They are then battered and breaded using a machine . Then , they are usually fried with oil at around 180 \u00b0C ( 356 \u00b0F ) and should reach the internal temperature of 75 \u00b0C ( 167 \u00b0F ) . After the cooking process , they are frozen and packaged and are kept frozen until used . European-style fishcakes are similar to a croquette , consisting of filleted fish or other seafood with potato patty , sometimes coated in breadcrumbs or batter . Fishcakes as defined in the Oxford Dictionary of Food and Nutrition are chopped or minced fish mixed with potato , egg and flour with seasonings of onions , peppers and sometimes herbs . The fishcake has been seen as a way of using up leftovers that might otherwise be thrown away . In Mrs Beeton 's 19th century publication Book of Household Management , her recipe for fishcakes calls for leftover fish and cold potatoes . More modern recipes have added to the dish , suggesting ingredients such as smoked salmon and vegetables .",
  "/wiki/Salmon": "Salmon /\u02c8s\u00e6m\u0259n/ is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae . Other fish in the same family include trout , char , grayling and whitefish . Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic ( genus Salmo ) and Pacific Ocean ( genus Oncorhynchus ) . Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America . Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world . Typically , salmon are anadromous : they hatch in fresh water , migrate to the ocean , then return to fresh water to reproduce . However , populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives . Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn . Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true . A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems ; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon . Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory . Salmon date back to the Neogene .",

A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger . The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own , especially in the United Kingdom , where the term patty is rarely used , or the term can even refer simply to ground beef . Since the term hamburger usually implies beef , for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used , as in beef burger , turkey burger , bison burger , or veggie burger . Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants , diners , and specialty and high-end restaurants ( where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger , but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu ) .

An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world .

Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) . The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11 , 1912 .",

Meat , fish , and lapsang souchong tea are often smoked . In Europe , alder is the traditional smoking wood , but oak is more often used now , and beech to a lesser extent . In North America , hickory , mesquite , oak , pecan , alder , maple , and fruit-tree woods , such as apple , cherry , and plum , are commonly used for smoking . Other biomass besides wood can also be employed , sometimes with the addition of flavoring ingredients . Chinese tea-smoking uses a mixture of uncooked rice , sugar , and tea , heated at the base of a wok . Some North American ham and bacon makers smoke their products over burning corncobs . Peat is burned to dry and smoke the barley malt used to make whisky and some beers . In New Zealand , sawdust from the native manuka ( tea tree ) is commonly used for hot smoking fish . In Iceland , dried sheep dung is used to cold-smoke fish , lamb , mutton and whale . Historically , farms in the Western world included a small building termed the smokehouse , where meats could be smoked and stored . This was generally well-separated from other buildings both because of the fire danger and because of the smoke emanations ; the smoking of food could possibly introduce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which may lead to an increased risk of some types of cancer ; however , this association is still being debated .",

A paste made from its ground rhizomes is used as a pungent condiment for sushi and other foods . It is similar in taste to hot mustard or horseradish rather than chili peppers in that it stimulates the nose more than the tongue . The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan . The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E. japonicum 'Daruma ' and 'Mazuma ' , but there are many others . The oldest record of wasabi as a food dates to the 8th century AD . The popularity of wasabi in English-speaking countries has tracked that of sushi , growing steadily starting in about 1980 . Due to issues that limit the Japanese wasabi plant 's mass cultivation and thus increase its price and decrease availability outside Japan , the western horseradish plant is generally used in place of the Japanese horseradish . This version is commonly referred to as western wasabi in Japan .",
