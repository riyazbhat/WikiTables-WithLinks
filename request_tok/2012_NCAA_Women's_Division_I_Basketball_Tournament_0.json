  "/wiki/Ivy_League": "The Ivy League is an American collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private universities in the Northeastern United States . The term Ivy League is typically used to refer to those eight schools as a group of elite colleges beyond the sports context . The eight members are Brown University , Columbia University , Cornell University , Dartmouth College , Harvard University , the University of Pennsylvania , Princeton University , and Yale University . Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence , selectivity in admissions , and social elitism . While the term was in use as early as 1933 , it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division I athletic conference in 1954 . Seven of the eight schools were founded during the colonial period ( Cornell was founded in 1865 ) , and thus account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution . The other two colonial colleges , Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary , became public institutions instead . Ivy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious in the world , and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report . All eight universities place in the top seventeen of the 2020 U.S. News & World Report national university rankings , including four Ivies in the top three ( Columbia and Yale are tied for 3rd ) . In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report global university rankings , three Ivies rank in the top ten ( Harvard 1st , Columbia 7th , and Princeton 8th ) and six in the top twenty-three . Undergraduate-focused Ivies such as Brown University and Dartmouth College rank 99th and 197th , respectively . U.S. News has named a member of the Ivy League as the best national university in each of the past 18 years ending with the 2018 rankings : Princeton eleven times , Harvard twice , and the two schools tied for first five times .",
