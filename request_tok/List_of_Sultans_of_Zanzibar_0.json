According to United Nations , as of 2018 , Mumbai was the second most populous city in India after Delhi and the seventh most populous city in the world with a population of 19.98 million . As per Indian government population census of 2011 , Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai . Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region , the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23.64 million . Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour . In 2008 , Mumbai was named an alpha world city . It is also the wealthiest city in India , and has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India . Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Elephanta Caves , Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus , and the city 's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings . The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people , who originated in Gujarat in prehistoric times . For centuries , the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay . During the mid-18th century , Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project , which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea . Along with construction of major roads and railways , the reclamation project , completed in 1845 , transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea .",

Plumbing uses pipes , valves , plumbing fixtures , tanks , and other apparatuses to convey fluids . Heating and cooling ( HVAC ) , waste removal , and potable water delivery are among the most common uses for plumbing , but it is not limited to these applications . The word derives from the Latin for lead , plumbum , as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes . In the developed world , plumbing infrastructure is critical to public health and sanitation . Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers although they work with piping as part of their trade and their work can include some plumbing .",
  "/wiki/Telegraphy": "Telegraphy is the long-distance transmission of textual messages where the sender uses symbolic codes , known to the recipient , rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message . Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy , whereas pigeon post is not . Ancient signalling systems , although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China , were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages . Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs . The earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe , invented in the late 18th century . The system was extensively used in France , and European countries controlled by France , during the Napoleonic era . The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century . It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph , initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling . This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse . The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system , but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph . The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865 , using a modified Morse code developed in Germany . The heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling .",

  "/wiki/Abolitionism": "Abolitionism , or the abolitionist movement , was the movement to end slavery . This term can be used both formally and informally . In Western Europe and the Americas , abolitionism was a historic movement that sought to end the Atlantic slave trade and set slaves free . King Charles I of Spain , usually known as Emperor Charles V , was following the example of Louis X of France , who had abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315 . He passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542 , although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states , and it was not enforced as a result . In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the slave trade in response to a plea by Louren\u00e7o da Silva de Mendou\u00e7a , and it was also vehemently condemned by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , and arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause . Soon after his death in 1785 , Sharp and More united with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect . The Somersett Case in 1772 , in which a fugitive slave was freed with the judgement that slavery did not exist under English common law , helped launch the British movement to abolish slavery . Though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century , the colonies and emerging nations that used slave labor continued to do so : Dutch , French , British , Spanish and Portuguese territories in the West Indies , South America , and the Southern United States . After the American Revolution established the United States , northern states , beginning with Pennsylvania in 1780 , passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery , sometimes by gradual emancipation .",

Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million .

The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash . The British authorities preferred Hamud bin Muhammed , who was more favourable to British interests , as sultan . In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886 , a condition for accession to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British consul , and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement . The British considered this a casus belli and sent an ultimatum to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace . In response , Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace . The ultimatum expired at 09:00 East Africa Time ( EAT ) on 27 August , by which time the British had gathered three cruisers , two gunboats , 150 marines and sailors , and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area .

  "/wiki/Regent": "A regent ( from the Latin regens : ruling , governing ) is a person appointed to govern a state because the monarch is a minor , is absent , or is incapacitated . The rule of a regent or regents is called a regency . A regent or regency council may be formed ad hoc or in accordance with a constitutional rule . Regent is sometimes a formal title . If the regent is holding his position due to his position in the line of succession , the compound term prince regent is often used ; if the regent of a minor is his mother , she is often referred to as queen regent . If the formally appointed regent is unavailable or can not serve on a temporary basis , a regent ad interim may be appointed to fill the gap . In a monarchy , a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons , but may also be elected to rule during the interregnum when the royal line has died out . This was the case in the Kingdom of Finland and the Kingdom of Hungary , where the royal line was considered extinct in the aftermath of World War I . In Iceland , the regent represented the King of Denmark as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944 . In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ( 1569-1795 ) , kings were elective , which often led to a fairly long interregnum . In the interim , it was the Roman Catholic primate ( the archbishop of Gniezno ) who served as the regent , termed the interrex ( Latin : ruler 'between kings ' as in ancient Rome ) .

  "/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy": "A constitutional monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises authority in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution . Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy ( in which a monarch holds absolute power ) in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework . Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Monaco , Morocco , Jordan , Kuwait and Bahrain , where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign , to countries such as the United Kingdom , Spain , Belgium , Sweden and Japan , where the monarch retains no formal authority . Constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution , whether written or unwritten . While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarch 's name , in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets public policy or chooses political leaders . Political scientist Vernon Bogdanor , paraphrasing Thomas Macaulay , has defined a constitutional monarch as A sovereign who reigns but does not rule . In addition to acting as a visible symbol of national unity , a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as dissolving parliament or giving royal assent to legislation . However , the exercise of such powers is largely strictly in accordance with either written constitutional principles or unwritten constitutional conventions , rather than any personal political preference imposed by the sovereign . In The English Constitution , British political theorist Walter Bagehot identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch may freely exercise : the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn . Many constitutional monarchies still retain significant authorities or political influence however , such as through certain reserve powers , and may also play an important political role . The United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms are all constitutional monarchies in the Westminster system of constitutional governance . Two constitutional monarchies - Malaysia and Cambodia - are elective monarchies , wherein the ruler is periodically selected by a small electoral college ."
