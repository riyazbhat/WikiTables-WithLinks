It has an area of approximately 32,000 square kilometres ( 12,000 sq mi ) , making it the country 's third largest local government region . Its population was 232,300 in June 2018 .

The exact meaning of the term is disputed , with common translations being isolated village and place of red earth , the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin . Otago is also the old name of the European settlement on the Otago Harbour , established by the Weller Brothers in 1831 , which lies close to the modern harbourside community of Otakou . The place later became the focus of the Otago Association , an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland , notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people , not the landowner , should choose the ministers . Major centres include Dunedin ( the principal city ) , Oamaru ( made famous by Janet Frame ) , Balclutha , Alexandra , and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wanaka . Kaitangata in South Otago is a prominent source of coal . The Waitaki and Clutha rivers provide much of the country 's hydroelectric power .
