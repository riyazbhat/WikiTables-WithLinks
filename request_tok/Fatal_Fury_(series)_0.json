Fatal Fury was SNK 's first fighting game for the Neo Geo system and served as the inaugural game in their Fatal Fury series , as well as the first game to depict the fictional King of Fighters tournament ( which became the basis for the later The King of Fighters games ) . Many of SNK 's mainstay characters , including the Bogard brothers Terry and Andy , friend Joe Higashi , and their nemesis Geese Howard , made their debut in this game .",
  "/wiki/Neo_Geo_(console)": "The Neo Geo ( Japanese : \u30cd\u30aa\u30b8\u30aa , Hepburn : Neojio ) , stylised as NEO\u30fbGEO , also written as NEOGEO , is a cartridge-based arcade system board and fourth-generation home video game console released on April 26 , 1990 , by Japanese game company SNK Corporation . It was the first system in SNK 's Neo Geo family . The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit ; its CPU is technically a 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor , while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus . The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS ( Multi Video System ) coin-operated arcade machine . The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet , a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace , as well as saving money long-term . With its games stored on self-contained cartridges , a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game 's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork . A home console version was also made , called AES ( Advanced Entertainment System ) . It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan ( called Neo Geo Rental System ) , with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use - this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console . The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility , thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users . The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system . The Neo Geo was a very powerful system when released , more powerful than any video game console at the time , and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom 's CPS , which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993 . The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s due to the cabinet 's low cost , six ROM slots , and compact size .",
  "/wiki/Neo_Geo": "Neo Geo [ a ] is a family of video game hardware developed by SNK . On the market from 1990 to 2004 , the brand originated with the release of an arcade system , the Neo Geo MVS and its home console counterpart , the Neo Geo AES . Both the arcade system and console were powerful for the time and the AES allows for perfect compatibility of games released for the MVS . However , the high price for both the AES console and its games prevented it from directly competing with its contemporaries , the Sega Genesis , Super NES , and TurboGrafx-16 . However , the MVS arcade became very successful in stores in Japan and North America . Years later , SNK released the Neo Geo CD , a more cost-effective console with games released on compact discs . The console was met with limited success , due in part to its slow CD-ROM drive . In an attempt to compete with increasingly popular 3D games , SNK released the Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade system in 1997 as the successor to its aging MVS . The system did not fare well and only a few games were released for it . A planned home console based on the hardware was never released . SNK later extended the brand by releasing two handheld consoles , the Neo Geo Pocket , and later Neo Geo Pocket Color , which briefly competed with Nintendo 's Game Boy . Soon after their release , SNK encountered various legal and financial issues - however , the original Neo Geo MVS and AES continued getting new games under new ownership until officially being discontinued in 2004 , ending the brand .",

It plays a library of more than 900 games created by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers delivered on ROM-based cartridges . Several add-ons were released , including a Power Base Converter to play Master System games . It was released in several different versions , some created by third parties . Sega created two network services to support the Genesis : Sega Meganet and Sega Channel .

Contributing to its success were its library of arcade game ports , the popularity of Sega 's Sonic the Hedgehog series , several popular sports franchises , and aggressive youth marketing that positioned the system as the cool console for adolescents .",

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

  "/wiki/Sega_Saturn": "The Sega Saturn [ a ] [ b ] is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe . The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",

The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU .

  "/wiki/PlayStation_Vita": "The PlayStation Vita ( also known as the PS Vita or simply Vita ) is a handheld video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It was first released in Japan on December 17 , 2011 , and in North America , Europe , and other international territories beginning on February 22 , 2012 . The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units ."
