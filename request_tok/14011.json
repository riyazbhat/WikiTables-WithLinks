  "/wiki/Valdivia,_Chile": "Valdivia ( Spanish pronunciation : [ bal\u02c8di\u03b2ja ] ; Mapuche : Ainil ) is a city and commune in southern Chile , administered by the Municipality of Valdivia . The city is named after its founder Pedro de Valdivia and is located at the confluence of the Calle-Calle , Valdivia , and Cau-Cau Rivers , approximately 15 km ( 9 mi ) east of the coastal towns of Corral and Niebla . Since October 2007 , Valdivia has been the capital of Los R\u00edos Region and is also the capital of Valdivia Province . The national census of 2002 recorded the commune of Valdivia as having 140,559 inhabitants ( Valdivianos ) , of whom 127,750 were living in the city . The main economic activities of Valdivia include tourism , wood pulp manufacturing , forestry , metallurgy , and beer production . The city is also the home of the Austral University of Chile , founded in 1954 and the Centro de Estudios Cient\u00edficos . The city of Valdivia and the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago were once the two southernmost outliers of the Spanish Empire . From 1645 to 1740 the city depended directly on the Viceroyalty of Peru , which financed the building of the Valdivian fort system that turned Valdivia into one of the most fortified cities of the New World . In the second half of the 19th century , Valdivia was the port of entry for German immigrants who settled in the city and surrounding areas . In 1960 Valdivia was severely damaged by the Great Chilean earthquake , the most powerful earthquake ever recorded at magnitude 9.5 . Debris and destroyed buildings from the earthquake can still be found in the suburban areas . In addition , land subsidence and sediments have resulted in complex navigation challenges on the local rivers and in some areas , ruins of buildings are visible from the water .",
  "/wiki/1960_Valdivia_earthquake": "The 1960 Valdivia earthquake ( Spanish : Terremoto de Valdivia ) or the Great Chilean earthquake ( Gran terremoto de Chile ) on 22 May 1960 is the most powerful earthquake ever recorded . Various studies have placed it at 9.4-9.6 on the moment magnitude scale . It occurred in the afternoon ( 19:11 GMT , 15:11 local time ) , and lasted approximately 10 minutes . The resulting tsunami affected southern Chile , Hawaii , Japan , the Philippines , eastern New Zealand , southeast Australia , and the Aleutian Islands . The epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco , approximately 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) south of Santiago , with Valdivia being the most affected city . The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast , with waves up to 25 metres ( 82 ft ) . The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo , Hawaii . Waves as high as 10.7 metres ( 35 ft ) were recorded 10,000 kilometres ( 6,200 mi ) from the epicenter , and as far away as Japan and the Philippines . The death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain . Various estimates of the total number of fatalities from the earthquake and tsunamis have been published , ranging between 1,000 and 7,000 killed . Different sources have estimated the monetary cost ranged from US $ 400 million to $ 800 million ( or $ 3.46 billion to $ 6.91 billion today , adjusted for inflation ) .",

An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) . The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11 , 1912 .",

Lasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds , the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake recorded in North American history , and the second most powerful earthquake recorded in world history . Six hundred miles ( 970 km ) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft ( 18 m ) , releasing about 500 years of stress buildup . Soil liquefaction , fissures , landslides , and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property . Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses , buildings , and infrastructure ( paved streets , sidewalks , water and sewer mains , electrical systems , and other man-made equipment ) , particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm . Two hundred miles ( 320 km ) southwest , some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet ( 9 m ) . Southeast of Anchorage , areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) , requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark . In Prince William Sound , Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide , resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks , and inside the ship that was docked there at the time . Nearby , a 27-foot ( 8.2 m ) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega , killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there ; survivors out-ran the wave , climbing to high ground . Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier , Seward , Kodiak , and other Alaskan communities , as well as people and property in British Columbia , Washington , Oregon , and California . Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan .",

It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1-9.3 Mw , reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas . The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate . A series of massive tsunami waves grew up to 30 metres ( 100 ft ) high once heading inland , after being created by the underwater seismic activity offshore . Communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean were severely affected , and the tsunamis killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries . The Indonesian city of Banda Aceh reported the largest number of victims . The earthquake was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history . The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce , particularly in Indonesia , Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand . The earthquake was the third-largest ever recorded and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed ; between eight and ten minutes . It caused the planet to vibrate as much as 10 millimetres ( 0.4 inches ) , and it remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska . Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra . The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response , with donations totalling more than US $ 14 billion .",

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan , and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900 . The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that may have reached heights of up to 40.5 meters ( 133 ft ) in Miyako in T\u014dhoku 's Iwate Prefecture , and which , in the Sendai area , traveled at 700 km/h ( 435 mph ) for up to 10 km ( 6 mi ) inland . Residents of Sendai had only eight to ten minutes of warning , and more than 19,000 were killed , many at evacuation sites , more than a hundred of which washed away . The earthquake moved Honshu ( the main island of Japan ) 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) east , shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm ( 4 in ) and 25 cm ( 10 in ) , increased earth 's rotational speed by 1.8 \u00b5s per day , and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low-orbiting GOCE satellite . Initially , the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu 's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre , but after about three years , the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed its original height . The tsunami swept the Japanese mainland and killed over ten thousand people , mainly through drowning , though blunt trauma also caused many deaths . The latest report from the Japanese National Police Agency report confirms 15,899 deaths , 6,157 injured , and 2,529 people missing across twenty prefectures , and a report from 2015 indicated 228,863 people were still living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation .

The Russian Republic was composed of sixteen smaller constituent units of autonomous republics , five autonomous oblasts , ten autonomous okrugs , six krais and forty oblasts . Russians formed the largest ethnic group . The capital of the Russian SFSR was Moscow and the other major urban centers included Leningrad , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod and Samara . The economy of Russia became heavily industrialized , accounting for about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR .

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) .

It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

From the late 15th century to the early 19th , Spain controlled a huge overseas territory in the New World , the Asian archipelago of the Philippines , what they called The Indies ( Spanish : Las Indias ) and territories in Europe , Africa and Oceania . It was one of the most powerful empires of the 16th and 17th centuries . The Spanish Empire became known as the empire on which the sun never sets and reached its maximum extension in the 18th century . Castile became the dominant kingdom in Iberia because of its jurisdiction over the overseas empire in the Americas and the Philippines . The structure of empire was established under the Spanish Habsburgs ( 1516-1700 ) , and under the Spanish Bourbon monarchs the empire was brought under greater crown control and increased its revenues from the Indies . The crown 's authority in The Indies was enlarged by the papal grant of powers of patronage , giving it power in the religious sphere . An important element in the formation of Spain 's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon , known as the Catholic Monarchs , which initiated political , religious and social cohesion but not political unification . Iberian kingdoms retained their political identities , with particular administration and juridical configurations . Although the power of the Spanish sovereign as monarch varied from one territory to another , the monarch acted as such in a unitary manner over all the ruler 's territories through a system of councils : the unity did not mean uniformity . In 1580 , when Philip II of Spain succeeded to the throne of Portugal ( as Philip I ) , he established the Council of Portugal , which oversaw Portugal and its empire and preserv [ ed ] its own laws , institutions , and monetary system , and united only in sharing a common sovereign . The Iberian Union remained in place until in 1640 , when Portugal reestablished the independence under the House of Braganza .",
  "/wiki/British_Empire": "The British Empire comprised the dominions , colonies , protectorates , mandates , and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states . It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries . At its height , it was the largest empire in history and , for over a century , was the foremost global power . By 1913 , the British Empire held sway over 412 million people , 23 % of the world population at the time , and by 1920 , it covered 35,500,000 km2 ( 13,700,000 sq mi ) , 24 % of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic , and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase the empire on which the sun never sets was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . Envious of the great wealth these empires generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia . A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then , following union between England and Scotland in 1707 , Great Britain , the dominant colonial power in North America . It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company 's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies .

During the 19th century , the Dutch possessions and hegemony were expanded , reaching their greatest territorial extent in the early 20th century . This colony was one of the most valuable colonies under the Dutch Empire 's rule , and contributed to Dutch global prominence in spice and cash crop trade in the 19th to early 20th century . The colonial social order was based on rigid racial and social structures with a Dutch elite living separate from but linked to their native subjects . The term Indonesia came into use for the geographical location after 1880 . In the early 20th century , local intellectuals began developing the concept of Indonesia as a nation state , and set the stage for an independence movement . Japan 's World War II occupation dismantled much of the Dutch colonial state and economy . Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945 , Indonesian nationalists declared independence which they fought to secure during the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution . The Netherlands formally recognized sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia at the 1949 Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference with the exception of the Netherlands New Guinea ( Western New Guinea ) , whose administration was transferred under authority of Resolution 1752 ( XVII ) to the United Nations 13 years later in 1962 ( also see New York Agreement ) .",

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa , Tamang , Qiang , Sherpa , and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people . Tibet is the highest region on Earth , with an average elevation of 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain , rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level . The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",

  "/wiki/2005_Nias\u2013Simeulue_earthquake": "The 2005 Nias-Simeulue earthquake occurred on 28 March off the west coast of northern Sumatra , Indonesia . At least 915 people were killed , mostly on the island of Nias . The event caused panic in the region , which had already been devastated by the massive tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake , but this earthquake generated a relatively small tsunami that caused limited damage . It was the third most powerful earthquake since 1965 in Indonesia . The earthquake occurred at 16:09:37 UTC ( 23:09:37 local time ) on 28 March 2005 . The hypocenter was located 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) below the surface of the Indian Ocean , where subduction is forcing the Indo-Australian Plate to the southwest under the Eurasian Plate 's Sunda edge . The area is 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) west of Sibolga , Sumatra , or 1,400 kilometres ( 870 mi ) northwest of Jakarta , approximately halfway between the islands of Nias and Simeulue . Seismic recordings give the earthquake a moment magnitude of about 8.6 , and effects were felt as far away as Bangkok , Thailand , over 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) away ."
