  "/wiki/Mallard": "The mallard ( /\u02c8m\u00e6l\u0251\u02d0rd/ or /\u02c8m\u00e6l\u0259rd/ ) ( Anas platyrhynchos ) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas , Eurasia , and North Africa and has been introduced to New Zealand , Australia , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Argentina , Chile , Colombia , the Falkland Islands , and South Africa . This duck belongs to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae . The male birds ( drakes ) have a glossy green head and are grey on their wings and belly , while the females ( hens or ducks ) have mainly brown-speckled plumage . Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings ; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers . The mallard is 50-65 cm ( 20-26 in ) long , of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length . The wingspan is 81-98 cm ( 32-39 in ) and the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm ( 1.7 to 2.4 in ) long . It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks , weighing 0.72-1.58 kg ( 1.6-3.5 lb ) . Mallards live in wetlands , eat water plants and small animals , and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes . This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks . The female lays eight to 13 creamy white to greenish-buff spotless eggs , on alternate days . Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days . The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch .",
  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",
  "/wiki/Cockroach": "Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea , which also includes termites . About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats . About four species are well known as pests . The cockroaches are an ancient group , dating back at least as far as the Carboniferous period , some 320 million years ago . Those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches . Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs ; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living neopteran insects . They are common and hardy insects , and can tolerate a wide range of environments from Arctic cold to tropical heat . Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species , and , contrary to popular belief , extinct cockroach relatives and 'roachoids ' such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species . Some species , such as the gregarious German cockroach , have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter , social dependence , information transfer and kin recognition . Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity . They are popularly depicted as dirty pests , though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world .",

  "/wiki/Wolf": "The wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf , is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of Canidae , with males averaging 40 kg ( 88 lb ) and females 37 kg ( 82 lb ) . On average , wolves measure 105-160 cm ( 41-63 in ) in length and 80-85 cm ( 31-33 in ) at shoulder height . The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed features , particularly the ears and muzzle . The wolf is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the coyote and the golden jackal , to produce fertile hybrids with them . The winter fur of a wolf is long and bushy and predominantly mottled gray , although nearly pure white , red and brown to black colours also occur . Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog . The wolf is the most specialized member of the genus Canis for cooperative big game hunting , as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey , its more social nature , and its highly advanced expressive behaviour . It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring . Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition within the pack for food . Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality . The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds primarily on large wild hooved mammals , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage .",

  "/wiki/Osprey": "The osprey or more specifically the western osprey ( Pandion haliaetus ) - also called sea hawk , river hawk , and fish hawk - is a diurnal , fish-eating bird of prey with a cosmopolitan range . It is a large raptor , reaching more than 60 cm ( 24 in ) in length and 180 cm ( 71 in ) across the wings . It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish on the head and underparts . The osprey tolerates a wide variety of habitats , nesting in any location near a body of water providing an adequate food supply . It is found on all continents except Antarctica , although in South America it occurs only as a non-breeding migrant . As its other common names suggest , the osprey 's diet consists almost exclusively of fish . It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour to assist in hunting and catching prey . As a result of these unique characteristics , it has been given its own taxonomic genus , Pandion and family , Pandionidae . Three subspecies are usually recognized ; one of the former subspecies , cristatus , has recently been given full species status and is referred to as the eastern osprey .",
  "/wiki/Silverback_gorilla": "Gorillas are ground-dwelling , predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa . The genus Gorilla is divided into two species : the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas ( both critically endangered ) , and either four or five subspecies . They are the largest living primates . The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans , from 95 to 99% depending on what is included , and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos . Gorillas ' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa . Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa , gorillas cover a wide range of elevations . The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes , ranging in altitude from . Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level , with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda .",
  "/wiki/Bottlenose_dolphin": "Bottlenose dolphins , the genus Tursiops , are the most common members of the family Delphinidae , the family of oceanic dolphin . Molecular studies show the genus contains three species : the common bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ) , the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops aduncus ) , and the Burrunan dolphin ( Tursiops australis ) . Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide , being found everywhere except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions . Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted , examining mimicry , use of artificial language , object categorization , and self-recognition . They can use tools ( sponging ; using marine sponges to forage for food sources they normally could not access ) and transmit cultural knowledge from generation to generation , and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans . Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper . They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers . In some areas , they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape . Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins : people hunt them for food , and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps . The deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was 300 meters ( 990 feet ) . This was accomplished by Tuffy , a dolphin trained by the US Navy . Nellie , the longest-lived Atlantic bottlenose dolphin in human care , died at age 61 on April 30 , 2014 .",

  "/wiki/Shark": "Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton , five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head , and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head . Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha ( or Selachii ) and are the sister group to the rays . However , the term shark has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha , such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus , as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans . Under this broader definition , the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago . Acanthodians are often referred to as spiny sharks ; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper , they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole . Since then , sharks have diversified into over 500 species . They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark ( Etmopterus perryi ) , a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres ( 6.7 in ) in length , to the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) , the largest fish in the world , which reaches approximately 12 metres ( 40 ft ) in length . Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) . They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions , such as the bull shark and the river shark , which can be found in both seawater and freshwater . Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics . They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth . Well-known species such as the tiger shark , blue shark , great white shark , mako shark , thresher shark , and hammerhead shark are apex predators - organisms at the top of their underwater food chain .",
  "/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States": "The United States National Guard is part of the reserve components of the United States Armed Forces . It is a reserve military force composed of National Guard military members or units of each state and the territories of Guam , the Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico , and the District of Columbia , for a total of 54 separate organizations . All members of the National Guard of the United States are also members of the militia of the United States as defined by 10 U.S.C . \u00a7 246 . National Guard units are under the dual control of the state and the federal government . The majority of National Guard soldiers and airmen hold a civilian job full-time while serving part-time as a National Guard member . These part-time guardsmen are augmented by a full-time cadre of Active Guard & Reserve ( AGR ) personnel in both the Army National Guard and Air National Guard , plus Army Reserve Technicians in the Army National Guard and Air Reserve Technicians ( ART ) in the Air National Guard . The National Guard is a joint activity of the United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) composed of reserve components of the United States Army and the United States Air Force : the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard , respectively . Local militias were formed from the earliest English colonization of the Americas in 1607 . The first colony-wide militia was formed by Massachusetts in 1636 by merging small older local units , and several National Guard units can be traced back to this militia . The various colonial militias became state militias when the United States became independent . The title National Guard was used in 1824 by some New York State militia units , named after the French National Guard in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette .",
  "/wiki/Commanding_officer": "The commanding officer ( CO ) or sometimes , if the incumbent is a general officer , commanding general ( CG ) , is the officer in command of a military unit . The commanding officer has ultimate authority over the unit , and is usually given wide latitude to run the unit as they see fit , within the bounds of military law . In this respect , commanding officers have significant responsibilities ( for example , the use of force , finances , equipment , the Geneva Conventions ) , duties ( to higher authority , mission effectiveness , duty of care to personnel ) , and powers ( for example , discipline and punishment of personnel within certain limits of military law ) . In some countries , commanding officers may be of any commissioned rank . Usually , there are more officers than command positions available , and time spent in command is generally a key aspect of promotion , so the role of commanding officer is highly valued . The commanding officer is often assisted by an executive officer ( XO ) or second-in-command ( 2i/c ) , who handles personnel and day-to-day matters , and a senior enlisted advisor . Larger units may also have staff officers responsible for various responsibilities .",
  "/wiki/Red-tailed_hawk": "The red-tailed hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis ) is a bird of prey that breeds throughout most of North America , from the interior of Alaska and northern Canada to as far south as Panama and the West Indies . It is one of the most common members within the genus of Buteo in North America or worldwide . The red-tailed hawk is one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the chickenhawk , though it rarely preys on standard-sized chickens . The bird is sometimes also referred to as the red-tail for short , when the meaning is clear in context . Red-tailed hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range , occurring on the edges of non-ideal habitats such as dense forests and sandy deserts . The red-tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes including deserts , grasslands , coniferous and deciduous forests , agricultural fields and urban areas . Its latitudinal limits fall around the tree line in the Arctic and the species is absent from the high Arctic . It is legally protected in Canada , Mexico , and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . The 14 recognized subspecies vary in appearance and range , varying most often in color , and in the west of North America , red-tails are particularly often strongly polymorphic , with individuals ranging from almost white to nearly all black . The subspecies Harlan 's hawk ( B. j. harlani ) is sometimes considered a separate species ( B. harlani ) . The red-tailed hawk is one of the largest members of the genus Buteo , typically weighing from 690 to 1,600 g ( 1.5 to 3.5 lb ) and measuring 45-65 cm ( 18-26 in ) in length , with a wingspan from 110-141 cm ( 3 ft 7 in-4 ft 8 in ) . This species displays sexual dimorphism in size , with females averaging about 25% heavier than males .",
  "/wiki/Peregrine_falcon": "The peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) , also known as the peregrine , and historically as the duck hawk in North America , is a widespread bird of prey ( raptor ) in the family Falconidae . A large , crow-sized falcon , it has a blue-grey back , barred white underparts , and a black head . The Peregrine is renowned for its speed , reaching over 320 km/h ( 200 mph ) during its characteristic hunting stoop ( high-speed dive ) , making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom . According to a National Geographic TV program , the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h ( 242 mph ) . As is typical of bird-eating raptors , peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic , with females being considerably larger than males . According to one study , it has the fastest visual processing speed of any animal tested so far , and can register discrete changes up to 129 Hz or cycles per second . As an analogy , film is a series of still images projected onto a screen . Those still images need to be changing at roughly 25 frames per second before humans see them as fluid and no longer as individual , discrete pictures . The film would have to be refreshing at 129 frames per second before peregrine falcons stopped seeing flashing , still images and started seeing fluid motion . The peregrine 's breeding range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics . It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth , except extreme polar regions , very high mountains , and most tropical rainforests ; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand . This makes it the world 's most widespread raptor , and one of the most widely found bird species .",
  "/wiki/Golden_eagle": "The golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos ) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere . It is the most widely distributed species of eagle . Like all eagles , it belongs to the family Accipitridae . These birds are dark brown , with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes . Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings . Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive , sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey , mainly hares , rabbits , and marmots and other ground squirrels . Golden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200 km2 ( 77 sq mi ) . They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years . Most breeding activities take place in the spring ; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life . Females lay up to four eggs , and then incubate them for six weeks . Typically , one or two young survive to fledge in about three months . These juvenile golden eagles usually attain full independence in the fall , after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years .",
  "/wiki/Leopard": "The leopard ( Panthera pardus ) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera , a member of the Felidae . It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa , in small parts of Western and Central Asia , on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia . It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation , and are declining in large parts of the global range . In Hong Kong , Singapore , Kuwait , Syria , Libya , Tunisia and most likely in Morocco , leopard populations have already been extirpated . Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range . Leopards are hunted illegally , and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal practices and decoration . Compared to other wild cats , the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull . Its fur is marked with rosettes . It is similar in appearance to the jaguar , but has a smaller , lighter physique , and its rosettes are generally smaller , more densely packed and without central spots . Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers . The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur , opportunistic hunting behaviour , broad diet , strength , and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe , including arid and montane areas . It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour ( 36 mph ) .",
  "/wiki/Cougar": "The cougar ( Puma concolor ) is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae . It is native to the Americas . Its range spans from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America , and is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere . It is an adaptable , generalist species , occurring in most American habitat types . Due to its wide range , it has many names including puma , mountain lion , red tiger , and catamount . It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar . Secretive and largely solitary by nature , the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular , although daytime sightings do occur . The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines , including the domestic cat , than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae , of which only the jaguar is extant in the Americas . The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey . Primary food sources are ungulates , particularly deer . It also hunts species as small as insects and rodents . This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking , but can also live in open areas ."
