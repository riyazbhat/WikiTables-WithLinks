She was the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom , after being convicted of the murder of her lover , David Blakely . During her childhood , her family moved from Rhyl , to Basingstoke in Hampshire , and , in 1941 , to Hampstead in London . In her teens Ellis entered the world of London nightclub hostessing , which led to a chaotic life that included various relationships with men . One of these was with David Blakely , a racing driver engaged to another woman . On Easter Sunday , 10 April 1955 , Ellis shot Blakely dead outside the Magdala public house in Hampstead and was immediately arrested by an off-duty policeman . At her trial in June 1955 , she was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death . On 13 July , she was hanged at HM Prison Holloway",

  "/wiki/James_Hanratty": "James Hanratty ( 4 October 1936 - 4 April 1962 ) , also known as the A6 Murderer , was a British criminal who was one of the final eight people in the UK to be executed before capital punishment was effectively abolished . He was hanged at Bedford Gaol on 4 April 1962 , after being convicted of the murder of scientist Michael Gregsten , aged 36 , who was shot dead in a car on the A6 at Deadman 's Hill , near Clophill , Bedfordshire in August 1961 . Gregsten 's mistress , Valerie Storie , was raped , shot five times , and left paralysed . According to Storie , the couple were abducted at gunpoint in their car at Dorney Reach , Buckinghamshire , by a man with a Cockney accent and mannerisms matching Hanratty 's . The gunman ordered Gregsten to drive in several directions , before stopping beside the A6 at Deadman 's Hill , where the offences took place . The initial prime suspects were Hanratty , a petty criminal , and Peter Louis Alphon , an eccentric drifter . In police line-ups , Storie did not recognise Alphon , but eventually identified Hanratty . Her testimony was critical in securing a guilty verdict , but this was questioned by many who felt the supporting evidence too weak to justify conviction , and Hanratty 's brother fought for decades to have the verdict overturned . In 1997 , a police inquiry concluded he was wrongfully convicted and the case was sent to the Court of Appeal , which ruled in 2002 that a DNA test conclusively proved Hanratty 's guilt beyond any doubt",

  "/wiki/Inquest": "An inquest is a judicial inquiry in common law jurisdictions , particularly one held to determine the cause of a person 's death . Conducted by a judge , jury , or government official , an inquest may or may not require an autopsy carried out by a coroner or medical examiner . Generally , inquests are conducted only when deaths are sudden or unexplained . An inquest may be called at the behest of a coroner , judge , prosecutor , or , in some jurisdictions , upon a formal request from the public . A coroner 's jury may be convened to assist in this type of proceeding . Inquest can also mean such a jury and the result of such an investigation . In general usage , inquest is also used to mean any investigation or inquiry . An inquest uses witnesses , but suspects are not permitted to defend themselves . The verdict can be , for example , natural death , accidental death , misadventure , suicide , or murder . If the verdict is murder or culpable accident , criminal prosecution may follow , and suspects are able to defend themselves there . Since juries are not used in most European civil law systems , these do not have any ( jury ) procedure similar to an inquest , but medical evidence and professional witnesses have been used in court in continental Europe for centuries . Larger inquests can be held into disasters , or in some jurisdictions ( not England and Wales ) into cases of corruption",

The ancient parish of Rochdale was a division of the hundred of Salford and one of the largest ecclesiastical parishes in England , comprising several townships . By 1251 , Rochdale had become important enough to have been granted a Royal charter . Rochdale flourished into a centre of northern England 's woollen trade , and by the early 18th century was described as being remarkable for many wealthy merchants . Rochdale rose to prominence in the 19th century as a mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the first industrialised towns . The Rochdale Canal - one of the major navigable broad canals of the United Kingdom - was a highway of commerce during this time used for the haulage of cotton , wool and coal to and from the area . The socioeconomic change brought by the success of Rochdale 's textile industry in the 19th century led to its rise to borough status and it remained a dominant settlement in its region .

Her murder led to one of the longest proven cases of a miscarriage of justice in English legal history . The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and was the subject of a three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson . Over the course of his 15-day trial it was not revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes , including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened . Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment . [ Appeal 1 ] After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009 . DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him . [ Appeal 2 ] As a result of Hodgson 's appeal , Operation Iceberg was created by the Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) with the aim of using DNA evidence in pre-1990 rape or murder cases . This led to the review of 240 other convictions . The CCRC also requested that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA testing was available . In September 2009 , on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body , police named David Lace as the likely killer .

  "/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice": "A miscarriage of justice , also known as a failure of justice , occurs when a person is convicted and punished for a crime that he or she did not commit . It is seldom used as a legal defense in criminal and deportation proceedings . The term also applies to errors in the other direction - errors of impunity , or to any clearly unjust outcome in any civil case . Every miscarriage of justice in turn is a manifest injustice . Most criminal justice systems have some means to overturn or quash a wrongful conviction , but this is often difficult to achieve . In some instances a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several decades , or until after the innocent person has been executed , released from custody , or has died . Miscarriage of justice is sometimes used to describe any wrongful conviction , even when the defendant may be guilty , for example in reference to a conviction reached as the result of an unfair or disputed trial . While a miscarriage of justice is a Type I error for falsely identifying culpability , an error of impunity would be a Type II error of failing to find a culpable person guilty . However , the term miscarriage of justice is often used to describe the latter type as well . With capital punishment decreasing , the expression has acquired an extended meaning , namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted person . Wrongful convictions are frequently cited by death penalty opponents as cause to eliminate death penalties to avoid executing innocent persons . In recent years , DNA evidence has been used to clear many people falsely convicted",

  "/wiki/Life_imprisonment": "Life imprisonment ( also known as imprisonment for life , life in prison , whole-life order , a life sentence , a life term , lifelong incarceration , life incarceration or simply life ) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison either for the rest of their natural life or until paroled or otherwise commuted to a fixed term . Crimes for which , in some countries , a person could receive this sentence include murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder , blasphemy , apostasy , terrorism , severe child abuse , rape , child rape , espionage , treason , high treason , drug dealing , drug trafficking , drug possession , human trafficking , severe cases of fraud , severe cases of financial crimes , aggravated criminal damage in English law , and aggravated cases of arson , kidnapping , burglary , or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm , piracy , aircraft hijacking , and in certain cases genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law . Life imprisonment ( as a maximum term ) can also be imposed , in certain countries , for traffic offenses causing death . The life sentence does not exist in all countries : Portugal was the first to abolish life imprisonment , in 1884 . Where life imprisonment is a possible sentence , there may also exist formal mechanisms for requesting parole after a certain period of prison time . This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence ( until that individual dies ) outside prison . Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct , possibly with certain restrictions or obligations . In contrast , when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended , the convict is free . The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary . Being eligible for parole does not necessarily ensure that parole will be granted . In some countries , including Sweden , parole does not exist but a life sentence may - after a successful application - be commuted to a fixed-term sentence , after which the culprit is released as if the sentence served was that originally imposed . In many countries around the world , particularly in the Commonwealth , courts have the authority to pass prison terms which may amount to de facto life imprisonment",

It is secreted by the gonads ( sexual glands ) and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize female ova . In humans , seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa : proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa , and provide a medium through which they can move or swim . Semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle , which is located in the pelvis . The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ejaculation .

  "/wiki/Murder_of_Linda_Cook": "The murder of Linda Cook was committed in Portsmouth on 9 December 1986 . The subsequent trial led to a miscarriage of justice when Michael Shirley , an 18-year-old Royal Navy sailor , was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment . In 1992 his case had been highlighted as one of 110 possible miscarriages of justice in a report presented to the Home Office by the National Association of Probation Officers and justice groups Liberty and Conviction . His conviction was eventually quashed in 2003 by the Court of Appeal after the DNA profile extracted from semen samples recovered from the victim 's body was proven not to be his . Cook 's murder took place shortly after six sexual assaults had been committed in the Buckland area of the city , and the killer was initially dubbed the Beast of Buckland by the news media . When police revealed that footprint evidence had been recovered and launched a search for matching shoes , the case became known as the Cinderella murder . Because of the brutal nature of the murder and the preceding sex attacks , Hampshire police were under public pressure to quickly make an arrest . Shirley 's later exoneration of the murder after serving 16 years of his sentence is significant as the first time that a UK court quashed a previous conviction on the basis of presentation of new DNA evidence . It was also the first occasion in which the Criminal Cases Review Commission supported an appeal on the basis of newly available DNA evidence . After serving the minimum tariff of 15 years , Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the parole board , but he refused to do so and said : I would have died in prison rather than admit something I did n't do .

In the sixteenth century , Portsmouth was England 's first line of defence during the French invasion of 1545 . By the early nineteenth century , the world 's first mass production line was set up in Portsmouth Dockyard 's Block Mills , making it the most industrialised site in the world and birthplace of the Industrial Revolution . Portsmouth was also the most heavily fortified town in the world , and was considered the world 's greatest naval port at the height of the British Empire throughout Pax Britannica . Defences known as the Palmerston Forts were built around Portsmouth in 1859 in anticipation of another invasion from continental Europe . In 1926 , Portsmouth was officially elevated in status from a town to a city",
  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels",
  "/wiki/Court_of_Appeal": "An appellate court , commonly called an appeals court , court of appeals ( American English ) , appeal court ( British English ) , court of second instance or second instance court , is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal . In most jurisdictions , the court system is divided into at least three levels : the trial court , which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case ; at least one intermediate appellate court ; and a supreme court ( or court of last resort ) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts . A jurisdiction 's supreme court is that jurisdiction 's highest appellate court . Appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules . The authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another . In some areas , the appellate court has limited powers of review . Generally , an appellate court 's judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the court 's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified",

  "/wiki/Rapist": "Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person 's consent . The act may be carried out by physical force , coercion , abuse of authority , or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent , such as one who is unconscious , incapacitated , has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent . The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault . The rate of reporting , prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions . Internationally , the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged , per 100,000 people , from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median . Worldwide , rape is primarily committed by males against females . Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group . People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder . Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections",
  "/wiki/Extortionist": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access )",

It is the second-largest city and metropolitan area in England and the United Kingdom , [ b ] with roughly 1.1 million inhabitants within the city area and 3.8 million inhabitants within the metropolitan area . Birmingham is commonly referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom . Located in the West Midlands county and region in England , approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Central London , Birmingham , as one of the United Kingdom 's major cities , is considered to be the social , cultural , financial , and commercial centre of both the East and West Midlands . Distinctively , Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it , mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole - one of the closest main rivers is the Severn , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of the city centre . Birmingham 's urban area is the second-largest in the United Kingdom , with its most recently estimated population in 2017 being 2,897,303 , and it also lies within the most populated English district . A market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew in the 18th-century Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham . The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which , under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain , was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz",

Sixteen-year-old Suzanne Jane Capper died in Withington Hospital on 18 December 1992 , from multiple organ failure arising from 80 % burns after she was deliberately set on fire on 14 December . Before her death , Capper related that she had previously been kidnapped and kept prisoner for seven days at a house in Moston , Manchester , where she was beaten and tortured . She was taken from the house by car , driven into the countryside and forced out of the car virtually naked into a wood at Werneth Low where petrol was poured over her and she was set alight . The torture and murder arose from the avenging [ of ] trivial grievances : a sexual insult , infection with pubic lice and the loss of a pink duffel coat . Detectives conducting the inquiry said that for sheer mindless brutality the crime ranked alongside the torture inflicted on children by the Moors murderers . The case went to trial in November 1993 , but received comparatively little publicity as it coincided with the trial of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables for the murder of James Bulger . On 17 December 1993 , Jean Powell , aged 26 , her ex-husband Glyn Powell , aged 29 , and Bernadette McNeilly , aged 24 , were sentenced to life imprisonment for their parts in the murder .

The case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ; its fallout included cultural changes of attitudes on racism and the police , and to the law and police practice . It also led to the partial revocation of the rule against double jeopardy . Two of the perpetrators were convicted of murder in 2012 . After the initial investigation , five suspects were arrested but not charged . It was suggested during the investigation that Lawrence was killed because he was black , and that the handling of the case by the police and Crown Prosecution Service was affected by issues of race . A 1998 public inquiry , headed by Sir William Macpherson , examined the original Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) investigation and concluded that the force was institutionally racist . It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be repealed in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence : this was effected in 2005 upon enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 . The publication in 1999 of the resulting Macpherson Report has been called one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain . Jack Straw , Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 , commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary .

Following an appeal for information on her whereabouts and police enquiries , her body was discovered on 29 December , at a lay-by on the A449 in Hawford , Worcestershire . A post-mortem examination determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death . The case received extensive news coverage in the UK around the Christmas and New Year period , amid fears that it could be linked to a series of killings around the English Midlands , which police called the work of a Midlands Ripper . The murder investigation included the UK 's first national DNA screening programme in the hunt for a murder suspect , covering over 5,000 people .
