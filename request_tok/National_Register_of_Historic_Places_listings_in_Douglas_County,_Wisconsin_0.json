  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University",

A path where items are regularly carried between bodies of water is also called a portage . Early French explorers in New France and French Louisiana encountered many rapids and cascades . The Native Americans carried their canoes over land to avoid river obstacles . Over time , important portages were sometimes provided with canals with locks , and even portage railways . Primitive portaging generally involves carrying the vessel and its contents across the portage in multiple trips . Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted over one 's shoulders and the center strut may be designed in the style of a yoke to facilitate this . Historically , voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs . Portages can be many kilometers in length , such as the 19-kilometre ( 12 mi ) Methye Portage and the 8.5-mile ( 13.7 km ) Grand Portage ( both in North America ) often covering hilly or difficult terrain . Some portages involve very little elevation change , such as the very short Mavis Grind in Shetland , which crosses an isthmus",

  "/wiki/Mississippi_watershed": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system . From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods",

More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78 % of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law",

In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings .

  "/wiki/Whaleback": "A whaleback was a type of cargo steamship of unusual design , with a hull that continuously curved above the waterline from vertical to horizontal . When fully loaded , only the rounded portion of the hull ( the whaleback proper ) could be seen above the waterline . With sides curved in towards the ends , it had a spoon bow and a very convex upper deck . It was formerly used on the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States , notably for carrying grain or ore . The term developed in common usage in response to the ship 's appearance when fully loaded . A total of 44 such vessels were constructed from 1887 to 1898 . All but two were built initially as lake freighters for service on the Great Lakes . Six were built at Duluth , Minnesota ; 33 were built at West Superior , Wisconsin ; 2 at Brooklyn , New York ; one at Everett , Washington ; and one at Sunderland , England . A number of the Great Lakes vessels left the lakes for service on salt water seas . The term whaleback has also been applied to a type of high speed launch first designed for the Royal Air Force during World War II , and to certain smaller rescue and research vessels especially in Europe that , like the Great Lakes vessels , have hulls that curve over to meet the deck . An example of the former is the British Power Boat Company Type Two 63 ft HSL . The designation in this case comes not from the curve along the gunwale , but from the fore and aft arch in the deck",

They comprise Lakes Superior , Michigan , Huron , Erie , and Ontario . Hydrologically , there are only four lakes , because Lakes Michigan and Huron join at the Straits of Mackinac . The lakes form the Great Lakes Waterway . The Great Lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth by total area , and second-largest by total volume , containing 21 % of the world 's surface fresh water by volume . The total surface is 94,250 square miles ( 244,106 km2 ) , and the total volume ( measured at the low water datum ) is 5,439 cubic miles ( 22,671 km3 ) , slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal ( 5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km3 , 22-23 % of the world 's surface fresh water ) . Due to their sea-like characteristics ( rolling waves , sustained winds , strong currents , great depths , and distant horizons ) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas . Lake Superior is the second-largest lake in the world by area , and the largest freshwater lake by area . Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country . The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago , as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater .

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s",
  "/wiki/Turret": "In architecture , a turret ( from Italian : torretta , little tower ; Latin : turris , tower ) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle . Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification . As their military use faded , turrets were used for decorative purposes , as in the Scottish baronial style . A turret can have a circular top with crenelations as seen in the picture at right , a pointed roof , or other kind of apex . It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building ; however , a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building ; in this case , it is typically part of a room , that can be simply walked into - see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets , which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper . A building may have both towers and turrets ; turrets might be smaller or higher but turrets instead project from the edge of a building rather than continue to the ground . The size of a turret is therefore limited , since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building . Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel . In modern times , a gun turret is a weapon mount that houses the crew or mechanism of a projectile-firing weapon , allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired in some degree of azimuth and elevation . It can be found on warships , combat vehicles , military aircraft , and land fortifications , and usually offers some degree of armour or protection",
  "/wiki/Orphanage": "Historically , an orphanage is a residential institution , or group home , devoted to the care of orphans and other children who were separated from their biological families . Examples of what would cause a child to be placed in orphanages are when the parents were deceased , the biological family was abusive to the child , there was substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home that was detrimental to the child , or the parents had to leave to work elsewhere and were unable or unwilling to take the child . The role of legal responsibility for the support of children whose parent ( s ) have died or are otherwise unable to provide care differs internationally . The use of government-run orphanages has been phased out in the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , and in the European Union member-states during the latter half of the 20th century but continue to operate in many other regions internationally . While the term orphanage is no longer typically used in the United States , nearly every US state continues to operate residential group homes for children in need of a safe place to live and in which to be supported in their educational and life-skills pursuits . Homes like the Milton Hershey School in Pennsylvania , Mooseheart in Illinois and the Crossnore School and Children 's Home in North Carolina continue to provide care and support for children in need . While a place like the Milton Hershey School houses nearly 2,000 children , each child lives in a small group-home environment with house parents who often live many years in that home . Children who grow up in these residential homes have higher rates of high school and college graduation than those who spend equivalent numbers of years in the US Foster Care system , wherein only 44 to 66 percent of children graduate from high school . Research from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project ( BEIP ) is often cited as demonstrating that residential institutions negatively impact the wellbeing of children . The BEIP selected orphanages in Bucharest , Romania that raised abandoned children in socially and emotionally deprived environments in order to study the changes in development of infants and children after they had been placed with specially trained foster families in the local community . This powerful study demonstrated how the lack of loving attention typically provided to children by their parents or caregivers is pivotal for optimal human development , specifically of the brain ; adequate nutrition is not enough . Further research of children who were adopted from institutions in Eastern European countries to the US demonstrated that for every 3.5 months that an infant spent in the institution , they lagged behind their peers in growth by 1 month",

A member of the Democratic Party , he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century . Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression , implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history . As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System and defined American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century . His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II , which ended shortly after he died in office . He is rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents , along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , but has also been subject to substantial criticism .
