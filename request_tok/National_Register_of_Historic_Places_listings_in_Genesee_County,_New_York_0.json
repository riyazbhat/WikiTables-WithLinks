The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians .

  "/wiki/Cast_iron": "Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2% . Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature . The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured : white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through , grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks , and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite nodules which stop the crack from further progressing . Carbon ( C ) ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt% , and silicon ( Si ) 1-3 wt% , are the main alloying elements of cast iron . Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel . Cast iron tends to be brittle , except for malleable cast irons . With its relatively low melting point , good fluidity , castability , excellent machinability , resistance to deformation and wear resistance , cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes , machines and automotive industry parts , such as cylinder heads , cylinder blocks and gearbox cases . It is resistant to damage by oxidation . The earliest cast-iron artefacts date to the 5th century BC , and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu in China . Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare , agriculture , and architecture . During the 15th century , cast iron became utilized for cannon in Burgundy , France , and in England during the Reformation .

  "/wiki/Rural_cemetery": "The rural cemetery or garden cemetery is a style of cemetery that became popular in the United States and Europe in the mid-nineteenth century due to the overcrowding and health concerns of urban cemeteries . They were typically built one to five miles outside of the city , far enough to be separated from the city but close enough for visitors and are known for the use of elaborate monuments , memorials and mausoleums in a landscaped park-like setting . The rural cemetery movement mirrored changing attitudes toward death in the nineteenth century . Images of hope and immortality were popular in rural cemeteries in contrast to the puritanical pessimism depicted in earlier cemeteries . Statues and memorials included depictions of angels and cherubs as well as botanical motifs such as ivy representing memory , oak leaves for immortality , poppies for sleep and acorns for life . From their inception , they were intended as civic institutions designed for public use . Before the widespread development of public parks , the rural cemetery provided a place for the general public to enjoy outdoor recreation amidst art and sculpture previously available only for the wealthy . Thoughts about rural cemeteries evolved toward the end of the 1800s due to the high cost of maintenance , development of true public parks and perceived disorderliness of appearance due to independent ownership of family burial plots and different grave markers . Lawn cemeteries became instead an attractive design .",

It can play a role in burial rites , serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife , and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead , whether as part of kinship-centred practices of ancestor veneration or as a publicly directed dynastic display . It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind , as an expression of cultural values and roles , and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead , maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living . The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures - Hindu culture , which has little , is a notable exception . Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures - from the Egyptian pyramids and the Tutankhamun treasure , to the Terracotta Army surrounding the tomb of the Qin Emperor , the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus , the Sutton Hoo ship burial and the Taj Mahal - are tombs or objects found in and around them . In most instances , specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy , although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods , usually from their possessions . An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies . The treasure of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun , for example , though exceptionally lavish , was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited , while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators . A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs . In other cultures , nearly all the art connected with the burial , except for limited grave goods , was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians .",
  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Marion_Power_Shovel": "Marion Power Shovel Company was an American firm that designed , manufactured and sold steam shovels , power shovels , blast hole drills , excavators , and dragline excavators for use in the construction and mining industries . The company was a major supplier of steam shovels for the construction of the Panama Canal . The company also built the two crawler-transporters used by NASA for transporting the Saturn V rocket and later the Space Shuttle to their launch pads . The company 's shovels also played a major role in the digging of the Hoover Dam and the New York City area with the digging of the Holland Tunnel and the extension of the Number 7 subway line to Main Street in Flushing , Queens . Founded in Marion , Ohio in August , 1884 by Henry Barnhart , Edward Huber and George W. King as the Marion Steam Shovel Company , the company grew through sales and acquisitions throughout the 20th century . The company changed its name to Marion Power Shovel Company in 1946 to reflect the industry 's change from steam power to diesel power . The company ceased to be an independent entity when it was sold , becoming the Marion division of Dresser Industries in 1977 . In 1992 Dresser spun off the Marion division and certain other assets into a holding company that would eventually become known as Global Industrial Technologies , Inc . Global put the Marion division up for sale in 1997 and its longtime rival Bucyrus International purchased the division for US $ 40.1 million . Bucyrus integrated the Marion division 's products into the Bucyrus product line , then closed the Marion , Ohio , facility .",
  "/wiki/Panama_Canal": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) is an artificial 82 km ( 51 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade . Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 32.5 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , neo-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression Another Day , Another Dollar comes from , as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor . France began work on the canal in 1881 , but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait . Colombia , France , and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction .",
