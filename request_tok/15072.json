  "/wiki/Indiana_limestone": "Indiana limestone - also known as Bedford limestone - has long been an economically important building material , particularly for monumental public structures . Indiana limestone is a more common term for Salem limestone , a geological formation primarily quarried in south central Indiana , USA , between the cities of Bloomington and Bedford . Bedford , Indiana , has been noted to have the highest quality quarried limestone in the United States . Salem limestone , like all limestone , is a rock primarily formed of calcium carbonate . It was deposited over millions of years as marine fossils decomposed at the bottom of a shallow inland sea which covered most of the present-day Midwestern United States during the Mississippian Period .",

  "/wiki/Bias-ply_tire": "A tire ( American English ) or tyre ( British English ; see spelling differences ) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel 's rim to transfer a vehicle 's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over . Most tires , such as those for automobiles and bicycles , are pneumatically inflated structures , which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface . Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively . The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber , natural rubber , fabric and wire , along with carbon black and other chemical compounds . They consist of a tread and a body . The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air . Before rubber was developed , the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear . Early rubber tires were solid ( not pneumatic ) . Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles , including cars , bicycles , motorcycles , buses , trucks , heavy equipment , and aircraft . Metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars , and solid rubber ( or other polymer ) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications , such as some casters , carts , lawnmowers , and wheelbarrows .",
  "/wiki/Stainless_steel": "In metallurgy , stainless steel , also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable ( inoxidizable ) , is a steel alloy , with a minimum of 11 % chromium content by mass and a maximum of 1.2 % carbon by mass . Stainless steels are most notable for their corrosion resistance , which increases with increasing chromium content . Additions of molybdenum increases corrosion resistance in reducing acids and against pitting attack in chloride solutions . Thus , there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure . Resistance to corrosion and staining , low maintenance , and familiar luster make stainless steel an ideal material for many applications where both the strength of steel and corrosion resistance are required . Stainless steel is rolled into sheets , plates , bars , wire , and tubing to be used in : cookware , cutlery , surgical instruments , major appliances ; construction material in large buildings , such as the Chrysler Building ; industrial equipment ( for example , in paper mills , chemical plants , water treatment ) ; and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products ( for example , chemical tankers and road tankers ) . Corrosion resistance , the ease with which it can be steam cleaned and sterilized , and lack of need for surface coatings has also influenced the use of stainless steel in commercial kitchens and food processing plants .",
  "/wiki/Leonardo_Nierman": "Leonardo Nierman ( born November 1 , 1932 ) , full name Leonardo Nierman Mendelejis , is a Mexican artist mostly known for his painting and sculpture . He at first wanted to be a violinist , but gave it up after twenty years when he compared a recording of his playing with that of Yehudi Menuhin . However , his musical training has been a major influence on his painting and sculpture , reproducing movement and harmony as Nierman sees similarities between the two disciplines . Nierman has had exhibitions in Mexico and abroad and over sixty recognitions of his work , half of which are from outside Mexico . His work is abstract but still with discernible images from nature such as birds , water , lightning and more . His paintings are in pure colors while his sculptures are generally of metal , often silver-toned .",
  "/wiki/Granite": "Granite ( /\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6n\u026at/ ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture . Granites can be predominantly white , pink , or gray in color , depending on their mineralogy . The word granite comes from the Latin granum , a grain , in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock . Strictly speaking , granite is an igneous rock with between 20 % and 60 % quartz by volume , and at least 35 % of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar , although commonly the term granite is used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar . The term granitic means granite-like and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and slight variations in composition and origin . These rocks mainly consist of feldspar , quartz , mica , and amphibole minerals , which form an interlocking , somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole ( often hornblende ) peppering the lighter color minerals . Occasionally some individual crystals ( phenocrysts ) are larger than the groundmass , in which case the texture is known as porphyritic . A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry . Granitoid is a general , descriptive field term for lighter-colored , coarse-grained igneous rocks . Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids . The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite .",
  "/wiki/Bronze": "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper , commonly with about 12-12.5 % tin and often with the addition of other metals ( such as aluminium , manganese , nickel or zinc ) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic , phosphorus or silicon . These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone , or have other useful properties , such as stiffness , ductility , or machinability . The archeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age . The beginning of the Bronze Age in India and western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC , and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China ; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions . The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC , although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times . Because historical pieces were often made of brasses ( copper and zinc ) and bronzes with different compositions , modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the generalized term copper alloy instead .",
  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14 % of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",
  "/wiki/Aluminum": "Aluminium ( aluminum in American and Canadian English ) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13 . It is a silvery-white , soft , non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group . By mass , aluminium makes up about 8 % of the Earth 's crust , where it is the third most abundant element ( after oxygen and silicon ) and also the most abundant metal . Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth 's mantle below , however . The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium metal is highly reactive , such that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments . Instead , it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation . Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries , such as building facades and window frames . The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium . Despite its prevalence in the environment , no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals . Because of these salts ' abundance , the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest , and studies continue .",
