A population of about 302,407 ( 2018 ) residents live within the city limits , making it the 66th-largest city in the U.S . The metropolitan population of 2,324,743 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia , the second-largest in Pennsylvania ( behind Philadelphia ) , and the 27th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is located in the southwest of the state , at the confluence of the Allegheny , Monongahela , and Ohio rivers . Pittsburgh is known both as the Steel City for its more than 300 steel-related businesses and as the City of Bridges for its 446 bridges . The city features 30 skyscrapers , two inclined railways , a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers . The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires , Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . Aside from steel , Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum , glass , shipbuilding , petroleum , foods , sports , transportation , computing , autos , and electronics . For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district . After the deindustrialization of the mid-20th century , Pittsburgh has transformed into a hub for the health care , education , and technology industries .",
