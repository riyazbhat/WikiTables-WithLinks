  "/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)": "Ariane is a series of a European civilian expendable launch vehicles for space launch use . The name comes from the French spelling of the mythological character Ariadne . France first proposed the Ariane project and it was officially agreed upon at the end of 1973 after discussions between France , Germany and the UK . The project was Western Europe 's second attempt to develop its own launcher following the unsuccessful Europa project . The Ariane project was code-named L3S ( the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher ) . The European Space Agency ( ESA ) charged Airbus Defence and Space , with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities , while Arianespace , a 32.5 % CNES ( French government space agency ) commercial subsidiary created in 1980 , handles production , operations and marketing . Arianespace launches Ariane rockets from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8 % of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11 % of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",
  "/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)": "Atlas is a family of US missiles and space launch vehicles that originated with the SM-65 Atlas . The Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) program was initiated in the late 1950s under the Convair Division of General Dynamics . Atlas was a liquid propellant rocket burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen in three engines configured in an unusual stage-and-a-half or parallel staging design : two outboard booster engines were jettisoned along with supporting structures during ascent , while the center sustainer engine , propellant tanks and other structural elements remained connected through propellant depletion and engine shutdown . The Atlas name was originally proposed by Karel Bossart and his design team working at Convair on project MX-1593 . Using the name of a mighty titan from Greek mythology reflected the missile 's place as the biggest and most powerful at the time . It also reflected the parent company of Convair , the Atlas Corporation . The missiles saw only brief ICBM service , and the last squadron was taken off operational alert in 1965 . However , from 1962 to 1963 Atlas boosters launched the first four US astronauts to orbit the Earth ( in contrast to the preceding two Redstone suborbital launches ) . The Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur satellite launch vehicles were also derived directly from the original Atlas . The Atlas-Centaur was evolved into the Atlas II , various models of which were launched 63 times between 1991 and 2004 . There were only six launches of the succeeding Atlas III , all between 2000 and 2005 . The Atlas V is still in service , with launches planned into the 2020s .",

European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

The original R-36 was deployed under the GRAU index 8K67 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-9 Scarp . It was able to carry three warheads and was the first Soviet MIRV ( multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ) missile . The later version , the R-36M was produced under the GRAU designations 15A14 and 15A18 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan . This missile was viewed by certain United States analysts as giving the Soviet Union first strike advantage over the U.S. , particularly because of its rapid silo-reload ability , very heavy throw weight and extremely large number of re-entry vehicles . Some versions of the R-36M were deployed with 10 warheads and up to 40 penetration aids and the missile 's high throw-weight made it theoretically capable of carrying more warheads or penetration aids .

Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines , a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) , and the expendable external tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . The Space Shuttle was launched vertically , like a conventional rocket , with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the ET . The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion , which used the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines . At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere . The orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing , usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center , Florida or Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base , California . After landing at Edwards , the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially modified Boeing 747 .",
  "/wiki/Universal_Rocket": "The Universal Rocket or UR family of missiles and carrier rockets is a Russian , previously Soviet rocket family . Intended to allow the same technology to be used in all Soviet rockets , the UR is produced by the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center . Several variants were originally planned , of which only three flew , and only two of which entered service . In addition , the cancelled UR-500 ICBM formed the basis for the Proton carrier rocket ."
