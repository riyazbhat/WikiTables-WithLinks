In Fiscal Year 2016 ( 1 Oct 2015 - 30 September 2016 ) , net program costs for the department were $ 273 billion , which includes VBA Actuarial Cost of $ 106.5 billion for compensation benefits . The long-term actuarial accrued liability ( total estimated future payments for veterans and their family members ) is $ 2.491 trillion for compensation benefits ; $ 59.6 billion for education benefits ; and $ 4.6 billion for burial benefits . The agency is led by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs , who - being a cabinet member - is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate . In May 2014 , it was revealed that veterans experienced extended delays in getting care at the Veterans Health Administration , and an investigation found that VA personnel falsified scheduling data to make it seem as if they had met scheduling targets .",

Because of the federalist underpinnings of the division between sovereign federal and state governments , the various state court systems are free to operate in ways that vary widely from those of the federal government , and from one another . In practice , however , every state has adopted a division of its judiciary into at least two levels , and almost every state has three levels , with trial courts hearing cases which may be reviewed by appellate courts , and finally by a state supreme court . A few states have two separate supreme courts , with one having authority over civil matters and the other reviewing criminal cases . 47 states and the federal government allow at least one appeal of right from a final judgment on the merits , meaning that the court receiving the appeal must decide the appeal after it is briefed and argued properly . Three states do not provide a right to a first appeal . Rather , they give litigants only a right to petition for the right to have an appeal heard .
