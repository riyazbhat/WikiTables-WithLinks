  "/wiki/River": "A river is a natural flowing watercourse , usually freshwater , flowing towards an ocean , sea , lake or another river . In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water . Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream , creek , brook , rivulet , and rill . There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features , although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size . Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location ; examples are run in some parts of the United States , burn in Scotland and northeast England , and beck in northern England . Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek , but not always : the language is vague . Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle . Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge , springs , and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks ( e.g. , from glaciers ) . Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape , however , they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth . They are made more obvious and significant to humans by the fact that many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams . Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers , as they are , or were , used as a source of water , for obtaining food , for transport , as borders , as a defensive measure , as a source of hydropower to drive machinery , for bathing , and as a means of disposing of waste . Potamology is the scientific study of rivers , while limnology is the study of inland waters in general .",
  "/wiki/Mya_(unit)": "A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun . Due to the Earth 's axial tilt , the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons , marked by change in weather , the hours of daylight , and , consequently , vegetation and soil fertility . In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet , four seasons are generally recognized : spring , summer , autumn , and winter . In tropical and subtropical regions , several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons ; but in the seasonal tropics , the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked . A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth 's orbital period as counted in a given calendar . The Gregorian calendar , or modern calendar , presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days , as do the Julian calendars ; see below . For the Gregorian calendar , the average length of the calendar year ( the mean year ) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days . The ISO standard ISO 80000-3 , Annex C , supports the symbol a ( for Latin annus ) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days . In English , the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used . In astronomy , the Julian year is a unit of time ; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds ( SI base unit ) , totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year . The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with , but not identical to , the calendar or astronomical year , such as the seasonal year , the fiscal year , the academic year , etc . Similarly , year can mean the orbital period of any planet ; for example , a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit .",

  "/wiki/Lake_Eyre": "Lake Eyre ( /\u025b\u0259r/ AIR ) , officially known as Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre , contains the lowest natural point in Australia , at approximately 15 m ( 49 ft ) below sea level ( AHD ) , and , on the rare occasions that it fills , is the largest lake in Australia , covering 9,500 km2 ( 3,668 sq mi ) . The shallow endorheic lake is the depocentre of the vast Lake Eyre basin and is found in Northern South Australia , some 700 km ( 435 mi ) north of Adelaide . When the lake is full , it has the same salinity level as the sea , but as the lake dries up and the water evaporates , salinity increases . The lake was named by Europeans in honour of Edward John Eyre , who was the first European to see it , in 1840 . The lake 's official name was changed in December 2012 to combine the name Lake Eyre with the indigenous name , Kati Thanda . The native title over the lake and surrounding region is held by the Arabana people .",

It shares borders with Western Australia to the west ( 129th meridian east ) , South Australia to the south ( 26th parallel south ) , and Queensland to the east ( 138th meridian east ) . To the north , the territory looks out to the Timor Sea , the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria , including Western New Guinea and other Indonesian islands . The NT covers 1,349,129 square kilometres ( 520,902 sq mi ) , making it the third-largest Australian federal division , and the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world . It is sparsely populated , with a population of only 245,800 , fewer than half as many people as Tasmania . The archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region . Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards . The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century . The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions . After three failed attempts to establish a settlement ( 1824-28 , 1838-49 , and 1864-66 ) , success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin . Today the economy is based on tourism , especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Ayers Rock ) in central Australia , and mining .

An epeiric ( or shelf ) sea on the European continental shelf , it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north . It is more than 970 kilometres ( 600 mi ) long and 580 kilometres ( 360 mi ) wide , with an area of 570,000 square kilometres ( 220,000 sq mi ) . The North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major fishery . The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries , and more recently the sea has developed into a rich source of energy resources , including fossil fuels , wind , and early efforts in wave power . Historically , the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs , particularly in Northern Europe . It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era . The North Sea was the centre of the Vikings ' rise . Subsequently , the Hanseatic League , the Netherlands , and the British each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus access to the world 's markets and resources . As Germany 's only outlet to the ocean , the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars . The coast of the North Sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features . In the north , deep fjords and sheer cliffs mark the Norwegian and Scottish coastlines , whereas in the south , the coast consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide mudflats .",

It is the longest of the Phanerozoic eras , lasting from 541 to 251.902 million years ago , and is subdivided into six geologic periods ( from oldest to youngest ) : the Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous , and Permian . The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic Era of the Proterozoic Eon and is followed by the Mesozoic Era . The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological , climatic , and evolutionary change . The Cambrian witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in Earth 's history , known as the Cambrian explosion , in which most modern phyla first appeared . Arthropods , molluscs , fish , amphibians , synapsids and diapsids all evolved during the Paleozoic . Life began in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land , and by the late Paleozoic , it was dominated by various forms of organisms . Great forests of primitive plants covered the continents , many of which formed the coal beds of Europe and eastern North America . Towards the end of the era , large , sophisticated diapsids and synapsids were dominant and the first modern plants ( conifers ) appeared . The Paleozoic Era ended with the largest extinction event in the history of Earth , the Permian-Triassic extinction event . The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic Era to recover . Recovery of life in the sea may have been much faster .",

Geologically , the range is a western extension of the Eifel , and both were raised during the Givetian age of the Devonian ( 382.7 to 387.7 million years ago ) , as were several other named ranges of the same greater range . Located primarily in Belgium and Luxembourg , but stretching as well into Germany and France ( lending its name to the Ardennes department and the former Champagne-Ardenne region ) , and geologically into the Eifel - the eastern extension of the Ardennes Forest into Bitburg-Pr\u00fcm , Germany , most of the Ardennes proper consists of southeastern Wallonia , the southern and more rural part of the Kingdom of Belgium ( away from the coastal plain but encompassing more than half of the country 's total area ) . The eastern part of the Ardennes forms the northernmost third of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , also called Oesling ( Luxembourgish : \u00c9islek ) . On the southeast the Eifel region continues into the German state of the Rhineland-Palatinate . The trees and rivers of the Ardennes provided the charcoal industry assets that enabled the great industrial period of Wallonia in the 18th and 19th centuries , when it was arguably the second great industrial region of the world , after England . The greater region maintained an industrial eminence into the 20th century , after coal replaced charcoal in metallurgy . Allied generals in World War II believed that the region was impenetrable to massed vehicular traffic and especially armor , so the area was effectively all but undefended [ citation needed ] during the war . The German Army twice used this region to invade Northern France and Southern Belgium , via Luxembourg in the Battle of France and the later Battle of the Bulge .",

  "/wiki/New_River_(Kanawha_River)": "The New River is a river which flows through the U.S. states of North Carolina , Virginia , and West Virginia before joining with the Gauley River to form the Kanawha River at the town of Gauley Bridge , West Virginia . Part of the Ohio River watershed , it is about 360 miles ( 580 km ) long . The origins of the name are unclear . Possibilities include being a new river that was not on the Fry-Jefferson map of Virginia , an Indian name meaning new waters , or the surname of an early settler . Despite its name , the New River is one of the five oldest rivers in the world geologically . However this claim is disputed by the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey and the National Park Service . This low-level crossing of the Appalachians , many millions of years old , has long been a biogeographical corridor allowing numerous species of plants and animals to spread between the lowlands of the American East Coast and those of the Midwest ; other unusual kinds of plants occur on the gorge 's cliffs or rim-top ledges . Portions of this corridor are now also used by various railroads and highways , and some segments of the river have been dammed for hydroelectric power production . The New River Gorge is not only quite scenic , but also offers numerous opportunities for white-water recreation such as rafting and kayaking . Many open ledges along the rim of the gorge offer popular views , with favorites including Hawks Nest State Park and various overlooks on lands of the New River Gorge National River . The New River Gorge and the U.S. 19 bridge crossing it are shown on the West Virginia State Quarter , minted in 2005 .",

The largest inland waterway in West Virginia , its valley has been a significant industrial region of the state since early in the 19th century . It is formed at the town of Gauley Bridge in northwestern Fayette County , approximately 35 mi ( 56 km ) SE of Charleston , by the confluence of the New and Gauley rivers . It flows generally northwest , in a winding course on the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau , through Fayette , Kanawha , Putnam , and Mason counties , past the cities of Charleston and St. Albans , and numerous smaller communities . It joins the Ohio at Point Pleasant . Paleo-Indians , the earliest indigenous peoples , lived in the valley and the heights by 10,000 BC as evidenced by archaeological artifacts such as Clovis points . A succession of prehistoric cultures developed , with the Adena culture beginning the construction of numerous skilled earthwork mounds and enclosures more than 2000 years ago . Some of the villages of the Fort Ancient culture survived into the times of European contact . The area was a place of competition among historical American Indian nations . Invading from their base in present-day New York , the Iroquois drove out or conquered Fort Ancient culture peoples , as well as such tribes as the Huron and Conoy . By right of conquest , the Iroquois , Lenape ( Delaware ) , and Shawnee reserved the area as a hunting ground . They resisted European-American settlement during the colonial years .",
  "/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains": "The Appalachian Mountains , [ a ] often called the Appalachians , are a system of mountains in eastern North America . The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period . They once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before experiencing natural erosion . The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel , as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most highways and railroads running east-west . Definitions vary on the precise boundaries of the Appalachians . The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) defines the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division as consisting of thirteen provinces : the Atlantic Coast Uplands , Eastern Newfoundland Atlantic , Maritime Acadian Highlands , Maritime Plain , Notre Dame and M\u00e9gantic Mountains , Western Newfoundland Mountains , Piedmont , Blue Ridge , Valley and Ridge , Saint Lawrence Valley , Appalachian Plateaus , New England province , and the Adirondack areas .

  "/wiki/Alleghenian_orogeny": "The Alleghanian orogeny or Appalachian orogeny is one of the geological mountain-forming events that formed the Appalachian Mountains and Allegheny Mountains . The term and spelling Alleghany orogeny was originally proposed by H.P . Woodward in 1957 . The Alleghanian orogeny occurred approximately 325 million to 260 million years ago over at least five deformation events in the Carboniferous to Permian period . The orogeny was caused by Africa colliding with North America . At the time , these continents did not exist in their current forms : North America was part of the Euramerica super-continent , while Africa was part of Gondwana . This collision formed the super-continent Pangaea , which contained all major continental land masses . The collision provoked the orogeny : it exerted massive stress on what is today the Eastern Seaboard of North America , forming a wide and high mountain chain . Evidence for the Alleghanian orogeny stretches for many hundreds of miles on the surface from Alabama to New Jersey and can be traced further subsurface to the southwest . In the north , the Alleghanian deformation extends northeast to Newfoundland . Subsequent erosion wore down the mountain chain and spread sediments both to the east and to the west .",

The Bay is located in the Mid-Atlantic region and is primarily separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Delmarva Peninsula with its mouth located between Cape Henry and Cape Charles . With its northern portion in Maryland and the southern part in Virginia , the Chesapeake Bay is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states , as well as others . More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the Bay 's 64,299-square-mile ( 166,534 km2 ) drainage basin , which covers parts of six states ( New York , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia and West Virginia ) and all of Washington , D.C . The Bay is approximately 200 miles ( 320 km ) long from its northern headwaters in the Susquehanna River to its outlet in the Atlantic Ocean . It is 2.8 miles ( 4.5 km ) wide at its narrowest ( between Kent County 's Plum Point near Newtown and the Harford County shore near Romney Creek ) and 30 miles ( 48 km ) at its widest ( just south of the mouth of the Potomac River ) . Total shoreline including tributaries is 11,684 miles ( 18,804 km ) , circumnavigating a surface area of 4,479 square miles ( 11,601 km2 ) . Average depth is 21 feet ( 6.4 m ) , reaching a maximum of 174 feet ( 53 m ) . The Bay is spanned twice , in Maryland by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Sandy Point ( near Annapolis ) to Kent Island and in Virginia by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel connecting Virginia Beach to Cape Charles . Known for both its beauty and bounty , the Bay has become emptier , with fewer crabs , oysters and watermen in past years . Recent restoration efforts begun in the 1990s have been ongoing and show potential for growth of the native oyster population .

  "/wiki/Hudson_River": "The Hudson River is a 315-mile ( 507 km ) river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States . The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York , flows southward through the Hudson Valley to the Upper New York Bay between New York City and Jersey City . It eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean at New York Harbor . The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York at its southern end . Further north , it marks local boundaries between several New York counties . The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary , deeper than the body of water into which it flows , occupying the Hudson Fjord , an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation , estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago . Tidal waters influence the Hudson 's flow from as far north as the city of Troy . The river is named after Henry Hudson , an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company , who explored it in 1609 , and after whom Hudson Bay in Canada is also named . It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524 , as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay , but he considered the river to be an estuary . The Dutch called the river the North River - with the Delaware River called the South River - and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland . Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson , and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony .

  "/wiki/Triassic": "The Triassic ( /tra\u026a\u02c8\u00e6s.\u026ak/ try-ASS-ik ) is a geologic period and system which spans 50.6 million years from the end of the Permian Period 251.9 million years ago ( Mya ) , to the beginning of the Jurassic Period 201.3 Mya . The Triassic is the first and shortest period of the Mesozoic Era . Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events . The Triassic period is subdivided into three epochs : Early Triassic , Middle Triassic and Late Triassic . Triassic began in the wake of the Permian-Triassic extinction event , which left the Earth 's biosphere impoverished ; it was well into the middle of the Triassic before life recovered its former diversity . Therapsids and archosaurs were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time . A specialized subgroup of archosaurs , called dinosaurs , first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic Period . The first true mammals , themselves a specialized subgroup of therapsids , also evolved during this period , as well as the first flying vertebrates , the pterosaurs , who , like the dinosaurs , were a specialized subgroup of archosaurs . The vast supercontinent of Pangaea existed until the mid-Triassic , after which it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses , Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south . The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry , with deserts spanning much of Pangaea 's interior . However , the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart . The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction , the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , that wiped out many groups and allowed dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic .",

It is the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era . The name Eocene comes from the Ancient Greek \u1f20\u03ce\u03c2 ( \u0113\u1e53s , dawn ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kain\u00f3s , new ) and refers to the dawn of modern ( 'new ' ) fauna that appeared during the epoch . The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch . The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope 13C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope 12C . The end is set at a major extinction event called the Grande Coupure ( the Great Break in continuity ) or the Eocene-Oligocene extinction event , which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay . As with other geologic periods , the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified , though their exact dates are slightly uncertain .",

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided . Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn . Mont Blanc spans the French-Italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the Alps . The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 metres ( 13,000 ft ) . The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones . Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) , and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations . Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era . A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian-Italian border in 1991 .

The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell ; its name comes from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( mei\u014dn , less ) and \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ( kainos , new ) and means less recent because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene . The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene . As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch . The apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early Miocene ( Aquitanian and Burdigalian stages ) , becoming widespread in the Old World . By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees to follow their own evolutionary path during the final Messinian stage ( 7.5-5.3 Ma ) of the Miocene . As in the Oligocene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent . In the seas of the Miocene , kelp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of Earth 's most productive ecosystems . The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern . Mammals and birds were well-established . Whales , pinnipeds , and kelp spread .",

It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era . The name is derived from the Latin creta . It is usually abbreviated K , for its German translation Kreide . The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate , resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas . These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles , ammonites and rudists , while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land . During this time , new groups of mammals and birds , as well as flowering plants , appeared . The Cretaceous ( along with the Mesozoic ) ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , a large mass extinction in which many groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , pterosaurs and large marine reptiles died out .

  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago . Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century , when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area , which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 .",

Most were deposited in warm , shallow seas and near ancient , long-gone sea shores in western North America . Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented , including lithified sand dunes from an extinct desert . There are at least 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in the Grand Canyon . Uplift of the region started about 75 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny ; a mountain-building event that is largely responsible for creating the Rocky Mountains to the east . In total , the Colorado Plateau was uplifted an estimated 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) . The adjacent Basin and Range Province to the west started to form about 18 million years ago as the result of crustal stretching . A drainage system that flowed through what is today the eastern Grand Canyon emptied into the now lower Basin and Range province . Opening of the Gulf of California around 6 million years ago enabled a large river to cut its way northeast from the gulf . The new river captured the older drainage to form the ancestral Colorado River , which in turn started to form the Grand Canyon . Wetter climates brought upon by ice ages starting 2 million years ago greatly increased excavation of the Grand Canyon , which was nearly as deep as it is now , 1.2 million years ago .",

Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E.

  "/wiki/Sudd": "The Sudd ( as-Sudd or al-Sudd ) is a vast swamp in South Sudan , formed by the White Nile 's Ba\u1e25r al-Jabal section . The Arabic word sudd is derived from sadd ( \u0633\u062f ) , meaning barrier or obstruction . The term the sudd has come to refer to any large solid floating vegetation island or mat . The area which the swamp covers is one of the world 's largest wetlands and the largest freshwater wetland in the Nile basin . For many years the swamp , and especially its thicket of vegetation , proved an impenetrable barrier to navigation along the Nile . The ancient Egyptians failed to penetrate the Sudd and reach the areas south of it . In AD 61 , a party of Roman soldiers sent by the Emperor Nero proceeded up the White Nile but were not able to get beyond the Sudd , which marked the limit of Roman penetration into equatorial Africa . For the same reasons in later times the search for the source of the Nile was particularly difficult ; it eventually involved overland expeditions from the central African coast , so as to avoid having to travel through the Sudd . In 2019 a team of climate scientists led by the UK 's Edinburgh University published a study in the Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , that suggested increased water flows into the Sudd may be partly causing up to a third of the global rise in atmospheric methane levels over the previous decade .",

It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era . The name is a combination of the Ancient Greek pal\u00e6o- meaning old and the Eocene Epoch ( which succeeds the Paleocene ) , translating to the old part of the Eocene . The epoch is bracketed by two major events in Earth 's history . The K-Pg extinction event , brought on by an asteroid impact and possibly volcanism , marked the beginning of the Paleocene and killed off 75% of living species , most famously the non-avian dinosaurs . The end of the epoch was marked by the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) , which was a major climatic event wherein about 2,500-4,500 gigatons of carbon were released into the atmosphere and ocean systems , causing a spike in global temperatures and ocean acidification . In the Paleocene , the continents of the Northern Hemisphere were still connected via some land bridges ; and South America , Antarctica , and Australia had not completely separated yet . The Rocky Mountains were being uplifted , the Americas had not yet joined , the Indian Plate had begun its collision with Asia , and the North Atlantic Igneous Province was forming in the third-largest magmatic event of the last 150 million years . In the oceans , the thermohaline circulation probably was much different than it is today , with downwellings occurring in the North Pacific rather than the North Atlantic , and water density mainly being controlled by salinity rather than temperature . The K-Pg extinction event caused a floral and faunal turnover of species , with previously abundant species being replaced by previously uncommon ones . In the Paleocene , with a global average temperature of about 24-25 \u00b0C ( 75-77 \u00b0F ) , compared to 14 \u00b0C ( 57 \u00b0F ) in more recent times , the Earth had a greenhouse climate without permanent ice sheets at the poles , like the preceding Mesozoic . As such , there were forests worldwide - including at the poles - but they had low species richness in regards to plant life , populated by mainly small creatures that were rapidly evolving to take advantage of the recently emptied Earth .",

  "/wiki/Himalayas": "The Himalayas , or Himalaya ( /\u02cch\u026am\u0259\u02c8le\u026a\u0259 , h\u026a\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0l\u0259j\u0259/ ) , is a mountain range in Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau . The range has many of Earth 's highest peaks , including the highest , Mount Everest ( Nepal/China ) . The Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding 7,200 m ( 23,600 ft ) in elevation , including ten of the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks . By contrast , the highest peak outside Asia ( Aconcagua , in the Andes ) is 6,961 m ( 22,838 ft ) tall . Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate , the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km ( 1,500 mi ) long . Its western anchor , Nanga Parbat , lies just south of the northernmost bend of Indus river . Its eastern anchor , Namcha Barwa , is just west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River ( upper stream of the Brahmaputra River ) . The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges . To the north , the chain is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by a 50-60 km ( 31-37 mi ) wide tectonic valley called the Indus-Tsangpo Suture . Towards the south the arc of the Himalaya is ringed by the very low Indo-Gangetic Plain . The range varies in width from 350 km ( 220 mi ) in the west ( Pakistan ) to 150 km ( 93 mi ) in the east ( Arunachal Pradesh ) . The Himalayas are distinct from the other great ranges of central Asia , although sometimes the term 'Himalaya ' ( or 'Greater Himalayas ' ) is loosely used to include the Karakoram and some of the other ranges .",
  "/wiki/Karakoram_Mountains": "The Karakoram is a large mountain range spanning the borders of Pakistan , China and India with the northwest extremity of the range extending to Afghanistan and Tajikistan . It begins in the Wakhan Corridor ( Afghanistan ) in the west and encompasses the majority of Gilgit-Baltistan ( Pakistan ) and extends into Ladakh ( India ) and the disputed Aksai Chin region controlled by China . It is the second highest mountain range in the world and part of the complex of ranges including the Pamir Mountains , the Hindu Kush and the Himalayan Mountains . The Karakoram has eight summits over 7,500 m ( 24,600 ft ) height , with four of them exceeding 8,000 m ( 26,000 ft ) : K2 , the second highest peak in the world at 8,611 m ( 28,251 ft ) , Gasherbrum I , Broad Peak and Gasherbrum II . The range is about 500 km ( 311 mi ) in length and is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions . The Siachen Glacier at 76 kilometres ( 47 mi ) and the Biafo Glacier at 63 kilometres ( 39 mi ) rank as the world 's second and third longest glaciers outside the polar regions . The Karakoram is bounded on the east by the Aksai Chin plateau , on the northeast by the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and on the north by the river valleys of the Yarkand and Karakash rivers beyond which lie the Kunlun Mountains . At the northwest corner are the Pamir Mountains . The southern boundary of the Karakoram is formed , west to east , by the Gilgit , Indus and Shyok rivers , which separate the range from the northwestern end of the Himalaya range proper . These rivers flow northwest before making an abrupt turn southwestward towards the plains of Pakistan . Roughly in the middle of the Karakoram range is the Karakoram Pass , which was part of a historic trade route between Ladakh and Yarkand but now inactive . The Tashkurghan National Nature Reserve and the Pamir Wetlands National Nature Reserve in the Karalorun and Pamir mountains have been nominated for inclusion in UNESCO in 2010 by the National Commission of the People 's Republic of China for UNESCO and has tentatively been added to the list .",

  "/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation": "The Quaternary glaciation , also known as the Pleistocene glaciation , is an alternating series of glacial and interglacial periods during the Quaternary period that began 2.58 Ma ( million years ago ) , and is ongoing . Although geologists describe the entire time period as an ice age , in popular culture the term ice age is usually associated with just the most recent glacial period . Since the planet Earth still has ice sheets , geologists consider the Quaternary glaciation to be ongoing , with the Earth now experiencing an interglacial period . During the Quaternary glaciation , ice sheets appeared . During glacial periods they expanded , and during interglacial periods they contracted . Since the end of the last glacial period the only surviving ice sheets are the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets . Other ice sheets , such as the Laurentide Ice Sheet , formed during glacial periods and completely disappeared during interglacials . The major effects of the Quaternary glaciation , have been the erosion of land and the deposition of material , both over large parts of the continents ; the modification of river systems ; the creation of millions of lakes , including the development of pluvial lakes far from the ice margins ; changes in sea level ; the isostatic adjustment of the Earth 's crust ; flooding ; and abnormal winds . The ice sheets themselves , by raising the albedo ( the extent to which the radiant energy of the Sun is reflected from Earth ) created significant feedback to further cool the climate . These effects have shaped entire environments on land and in the oceans , and their associated biological communities . Before the Quaternary glaciation , land-based ice appeared , and then disappeared , during at least four other ice ages .",

It rises in the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300 km ( 3,900 mi ) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea . It is the sixth-largest river by discharge volume in the world . Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China , and is home to nearly one-third of the country 's population . The Yangtze has played a major role in the history , culture and economy of China . For thousands of years , the river has been used for water , irrigation , sanitation , transportation , industry , boundary-marking and war . The prosperous Yangtze River Delta generates as much as 20% of the PRC 's GDP . The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world . In mid-2014 , the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network , comprising railways , roads and airports , to create a new economic belt alongside the river . The Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator , the narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze sturgeon , but also was the home of the extinct Yangtze river dolphin ( or baiji ) and Chinese paddlefish . In recent years , the river has suffered from industrial pollution , plastic pollution , agricultural run-off , siltation , and loss of wetland and lakes , which exacerbates seasonal flooding .

It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1,243 miles ( 2,000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume , the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific . The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the region 's many cultural groups . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean . These fish - especially the salmon species - provided the core subsistence for native peoples . In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",

  "/wiki/Jurassic": "The Jurassic ( /d\u0292\u028a\u02c8r\u00e6s.\u026ak/ juu-RASS-ik ; from the Jura Mountains ) is a geologic period and system that spanned 56 million years from the end of the Triassic Period 201.3 million years ago ( Mya ) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period 145 Mya . [ note 1 ] The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era , also known as the Age of Reptiles . The start of the period was marked by the major Triassic-Jurassic extinction event . Two other extinction events occurred during the period : the Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction in the Early Jurassic , and the Tithonian event at the end ; neither event ranks among the Big Five mass extinctions , however . The Jurassic period is divided into three epochs : Early , Middle , and Late . Similarly , in stratigraphy , the Jurassic is divided into the Lower Jurassic , Middle Jurassic , and Upper Jurassic series of rock formations . The Jurassic is named after the Jura Mountains within the European Alps , where limestone strata from the period were first identified . By the beginning of the Jurassic , the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses : Laurasia to the north , and Gondwana to the south . This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid , and many of the arid deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests . On land , the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna , dominated by both dinosauromorph and crocodylomorph archosaurs , to one dominated by dinosaurs alone . The first birds also appeared during the Jurassic , having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs . Other major events include the appearance of the earliest lizards , and the evolution of therian mammals , including primitive placentals .",

It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River that divides the eastern from western United States . The river flows through or along the border of six states , and its drainage basin includes parts of 15 states . Through its largest tributary , the Tennessee River , the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S . It is the source of drinking water for three million people . The lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the water level falls 26 ft. in 2 miles and is impassible for navigation . The McAlpine Locks and Dam , a shipping canal bypassing the rapids , now allows commercial navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico .

From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",
