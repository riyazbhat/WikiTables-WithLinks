  "/wiki/MAME": "MAME ( originally an acronym of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator ) is a free and open-source emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game systems in software on modern personal computers and other platforms . The intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten . The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines ; the ability to actually play the games is considered a nice side effect . Joystiq has listed MAME as an application that every Windows and Mac gamer should have . The first public MAME release was by Nicola Salmoria on February 5 , 1997 . The emulator now supports over 7,000 unique games and 10,000 actual ROM image sets , though not all of the supported games are playable . MESS , an emulator for many video game consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core , was integrated upstream into MAME in 2015",
  "/wiki/Multi_Emulator_Super_System": "Multi Emulator Super System ( MESS ) was an emulator for various consoles and computer systems , based on the MAME core and now a part of MAME . MESS emulates portable and console gaming systems , computer platforms , and calculators . The project strives for accuracy and portability and therefore is not always the fastest emulator for any one particular system . Its accuracy makes it also useful for homebrew game development . As of April 2015 MESS supported 994 unique systems with 2,106 total system variations . However , not all of the systems in MESS are functional ; some are marked as non-working or are in development . MESS was first released in 1998 and has been under constant development since . MAME and MESS were once separate applications , but were later developed and released together from a single source repository . MAMEDEV member David Haywood maintained and distributed UME ( Universal Machine Emulator ) which combined much of the functionality of MAME and MESS in a single application . On May 27 , 2015 , MESS was formally integrated with MAME and became a part of MAME",
  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development",

The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix .

Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system .

  "/wiki/Amstrad_CPC": "The Amstrad CPC ( short for Colour Personal Computer ) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990 . It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and the German-speaking parts of Europe . The series spawned a total of six distinct models : The CPC464 , CPC664 , and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market . The later 464plus and 6128plus , intended to prolong the system 's lifecycle with hardware updates , were considerably less successful , as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000 . The CPC models ' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU , complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM . Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device , either a compact cassette deck or 3 inch floppy disk drive . The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour , green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit 's power supply . Additionally , a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives , printers , and memory extensions , was available . The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software . The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor , its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users , which was reflected by a wide selection of application software . During its lifetime , the CPC series sold approximately three million units",

Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82 , it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine 's colour display , compared with the black and white display of its predecessor , the ZX81 . The Spectrum was released as eight different models , ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987 ; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide ( not counting clones ) . The Spectrum was among the first mainstream-audience home computers in the UK , similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US . The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine , the effects of which are still seen . Some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry . Licensing deals and clones followed , and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry . The Commodore 64 , Dragon 32 , Oric-1 , Oric Atmos , BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s .

The specification as released was powerful and one of the higher end in its class ( though not by the margin envisaged in 1983 ) . This was due to the use of ASICs for graphics and sound which took workload away from the CPU , an extensive implementation of ANSII BASIC and a bank switching system to allow for larger amounts of RAM than the Z80 natively supported . It also featured a distinctive and colourful case design , and promise of multiple expansion options .

The term public domain is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights , in which case use of the work is referred to as under license or with permission . As rights vary by country and jurisdiction , a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another . Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis , and the absence of registration in a particular country , if required , gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country . The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the public sphere or commons , including concepts such as the commons of the mind , the intellectual commons , and the information commons",
  "/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910": "The AY-3-8910 is a 3-voice programmable sound generator ( PSG ) designed by General Instrument in 1978 , initially for use with their 16-bit CP1610 or one of the PIC1650 series of 8-bit microcomputers . The AY-3-8910 and its variants were used in many arcade games - Konami 's Gyruss contains five - and pinball machines as well as being the sound chip in the Intellivision and Vectrex video game consoles , and the Amstrad CPC , Oric-1 , Colour Genie , Elektor TV Games Computer , MSX , and later ZX Spectrum home computers . It was also used in the Mockingboard and Cricket sound cards for the Apple II and the Speech/Sound Cartridge for the TRS-80 Color Computer . After General Instrument 's spinoff of Microchip Technology in 1987 , the chip was sold for a few years under the Microchip brand instead . It was also produced under license by Yamaha ( with minor modifications , i.e . a selectable clock divider pin , and a double-resolution but double-rate volume envelope table ) as the YM2149F ; the Atari ST uses this version . It produced very similar results to the Texas Instruments SN76489 and was on the market for a similar period . The chips are no longer made , but functionally-identical clones are still in active production . An unofficial VHDL description is freely available for use with FPGAs",
  "/wiki/TR-DOS": "TR-DOS is a disk operating system for the ZX Spectrum with Beta Disc and Beta 128 disc interfaces . TR-DOS and Beta disc were developed by Technology Research Ltd ( UK ) , in 1984 . It became a standard , and most disk releases for the ZX Spectrum , especially of modern programs are made for TR-DOS as opposed to other disk systems . Current emulators support TR-Dos disk images in the formats .TRD or .SCL . A clone of this interface is also used in the Russian Pentagon and Scorpion machines . The latest official firmware version is 5.03 ( 1986 ) . Unofficial versions with various enhancements and bug-fixes have been released since 1990 , with the latest being 6.10E ( 2006 ) . TR-DOS handles SS/DS , SD/DD floppy disks . All modern versions support RAM Disk and some versions support hard disks",
  "/wiki/Source_code": "In computing , source code is any collection of code , possibly with comments , written using a human-readable programming language , usually as plain text . The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers , who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code . The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code that can be executed by the computer . The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time . Alternatively , source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed . Most application software is distributed in a form that includes only executable files . If the source code were included it would be useful to a user , programmer or a system administrator , any of whom might wish to study or modify the program",
  "/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)": "MMX is a single instruction , multiple data ( SIMD ) instruction set designed by Intel , introduced in January 1997 with its P5-based Pentium line of microprocessors , designated as Pentium with MMX Technology . It developed out of a similar unit introduced on the Intel i860 , and earlier the Intel i750 video pixel processor . MMX is a processor supplementary capability that is supported on recent IA-32 processors by Intel and other vendors . The New York Times described the initial push , including Super Bowl ads , as focused on a new generation of glitzy multimedia products , including videophones and 3-D video games . MMX has subsequently been extended by several programs by Intel and others : 3DNow ! , Streaming SIMD Extensions ( SSE ) , and ongoing revisions of Advanced Vector Extensions ( AVX )",
  "/wiki/X86_assembly_language": "Each x86 assembly instruction is represented by a mnemonic which , often combined with one or more operands , translates to one or more bytes called an opcode ; the NOP instruction translates to 0x90 , for instance and the HLT instruction translates to 0xF4 . There are potential opcodes with no documented mnemonic which different processors may interpret differently , making a program using them behave inconsistently or even generate an exception on some processors . These opcodes often turn up in code writing competitions as a way to make the code smaller , faster , more elegant or just show off the author 's prowess",
  "/wiki/Nintendo_DS": "The Nintendo DS , [ b ] or simply DS , is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and released by Nintendo . The device released globally across 2004 and 2005 . The DS , an acronym for Developers ' System or Dual Screen , introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming : two LCD screens working in tandem ( the bottom one being a touchscreen ) , a built-in microphone , and support for wireless connectivity . Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP . The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network . Alternatively , they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service . Its main competitor was Sony 's PlayStation Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles . Prior to its release , the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental , third pillar in Nintendo 's console lineup , meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube . However , backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series . On March 2 , 2006 , Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite , a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens . On November 1 , 2008 , Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi , another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features , although it lost backwards compatibility for Game Boy Advance titles . All Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units , making it the best selling handheld game console to date , and the second best selling video game console of all time behind Sony 's PlayStation 2",
  "/wiki/Giftware": "A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return . An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given . Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity , a gift is meant to be free . In many countries , the act of mutually exchanging money , goods , etc . may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion . Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy . By extension the term gift can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad , especially as a favor , including forgiveness and kindness . Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays",
  "/wiki/Java_(software_platform)": "Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems , which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation , that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment . Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers . Java applets , which are less common than standalone Java applications , were commonly run in secure , sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages . Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) ; byte code compilers are also available for other languages , including Ada , JavaScript , Python , and Ruby . In addition , several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM , including Clojure , Groovy , and Scala . Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++ , but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap ( while some implementations e.g . all currently supported by Oracle , may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead ) and all variables of object types are references . Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM . On November 13 , 2006 , Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in October 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version ( Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support ) , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java , because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java 11 ( Java 12 is also an non-LTS option )"
