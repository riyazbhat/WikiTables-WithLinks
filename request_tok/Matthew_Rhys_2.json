In 1898 , a niece of Cons ' , Lilian Baylis , assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914 . The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after it reopened . The Old Vic is the crucible of many of the performing arts companies and theatres in London today . It was the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre and formed ( along with the Chichester Festival Theatre ) the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation in 1963 , under Laurence Olivier . The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the South Bank , opening in 1976 . The Old Vic then became the home of Prospect Theatre Company , at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as Derek Jacobi 's Hamlet .

  "/wiki/King_Lear": "King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare . It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters , after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner . His third daughter gets nothing , because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done . When he feels disrespected by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power , he becomes furious to the point of madness . He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter , just before tragedy strikes her and then the king . Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain , a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king , the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures , with the title role coveted by many of the world 's most accomplished actors . The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play , originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. Stephen 's Day in 1606 , was a 1608 publication in a quarto of uncertain provenance , in which the play is listed as a history ; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text . The Tragedy of King Lear , a revised version that is better tailored for performance , was included in the 1623 First Folio . Modern editors usually conflate the two , though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved . After the English Restoration , the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone , but since the 19th century Shakespeare 's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements . The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship . George Bernard Shaw wrote No man will ever write a better tragedy than Lear .",

  "/wiki/William_Shakespeare": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616 ) [ a ] was an English poet , playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",

  "/wiki/Macbeth": "Macbeth ( /m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8/ ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare ; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606 . [ a ] It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake . Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I , who was patron of Shakespeare 's acting company , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright 's relationship with his sovereign . It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book , and is Shakespeare 's shortest tragedy . A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself . He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia . Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion , he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler . The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death . Shakespeare 's source for the story is the account of Macbeth , King of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland , and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth . The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as The Scottish Play .",
  "/wiki/Macduff_(Macbeth)": "Lord Macduff , the Thane of Fife , is a character in William Shakespeare 's Macbeth ( c.1603-1607 ) that is loosely based on history . Macduff , a legendary hero , plays a pivotal role in the play : he suspects Macbeth of regicide and eventually kills Macbeth in the final act . He can be seen as the avenging hero who helps save Scotland from Macbeth 's tyranny in the play . The character is first known from Chronica Gentis Scotorum ( late 14th century ) and Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland ( early 15th century ) . Shakespeare drew mostly from Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) . Although characterised sporadically throughout the play , Macduff serves as a foil to Macbeth and a figure of morality .",

  "/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet": "Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families . It was among Shakespeare 's most popular plays during his lifetime and along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays . Today , the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers . Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity . The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567 . Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters , particularly Mercutio and Paris . Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 , the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 . The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality , however , and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare 's original . Shakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure ( especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story ) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill . The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters , sometimes changing the form as the character develops . Romeo , for example , grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play . Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage , film , musical , and opera venues .",
  "/wiki/Romeo": "Romeo Montague is the main protagonist of William Shakespeare 's tragedy , The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet . The son of Lord Montague and his wife , Lady Montague , he secretly loves and marries Juliet , a member of the rival House of Capulet , through a priest named Friar Laurence . Forced into exile after slaying Juliet 's cousin , Tybalt , in a duel , Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet 's death . The character 's origins can be traced as far back as Pyramus , who appears in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , but the first modern incarnation of Romeo is Mariotto in the 33rd of Masuccio Salernitano 's Il Novellino ( 1476 ) . This story was reworked in 1524 by Luigi da Porto as Giulietta e Romeo ( published posthumously in 1531 ) . Da Porto named the character Romeo Montecchi and his storyline is near-identical to Shakespeare 's adaptation . Since no 16th-century direct English translation of Giulietta e Romeo is known , Shakespeare 's main source is thought to be Arthur Brooke 's English verse translation of a French translation of a 1554 adaptation by Matteo Bandello . Although both Salernitano and da Porto claimed that their stories had historical basis , there is little evidence that this is the case . Romeo , an only child like Juliet , is one of the most important characters of the play , and has a consistent presence throughout it . His role as an idealistic lover has led the word Romeo to become a synonym for a passionate male lover in various languages . Although often treated as such , it is not clear that Montague is a surname in the modern sense .",
  "/wiki/Look_Back_in_Anger": "Look Back in Anger ( 1956 ) is a realist play written by John Osborne . It focuses on the life and marital struggles of an intelligent and educated but disaffected young man of working-class origin , Jimmy Porter , and his equally competent yet impassive upper-middle-class wife Alison . The supporting characters include Cliff Lewis , an amiable Welsh lodger who attempts to keep the peace ; and Helena Charles , Alison 's snobbish friend . Osborne drew inspiration from his personal life and failing marriage with Pamela Lane while writing Look Back in Anger , which was his first successful outing as a playwright . The play spawned the term angry young men to describe Osborne and those of his generation who employed the harshness of realism in the theatre in contrast to the more escapist theatre that characterised the previous generation . This harsh realism has led to Look Back in Anger being considered one of the first examples of kitchen sink drama in theatre . The play was received favorably in the theatre community becoming an enormous commercial success , transferring to the West End and Broadway , and even touring to Moscow . It is credited with turning Osborne from a struggling playwright into a wealthy and famous personality , and also won him the Evening Standard Drama Award as the most promising playwright of 1956 . The play was adapted into a motion picture of the same name by Tony Richardson , starring Richard Burton and Mary Ure , which was released in 1959 . Film production credited circa 1958 .",
