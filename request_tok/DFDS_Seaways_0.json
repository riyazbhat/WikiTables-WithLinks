  "/wiki/Gross_tonnage": "Gross tonnage ( GT , G.T . or gt ) is a nonlinear measure of a ship 's overall internal volume . Gross tonnage is different from gross register tonnage . Neither gross tonnage nor gross register tonnage should be confused with measures of mass or weight such as deadweight tonnage or displacement . Gross tonnage , along with net tonnage , was defined by the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships , 1969 , adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 1969 , and came into force on 18 July 1982 . These two measurements replaced gross register tonnage ( GRT ) and net register tonnage ( NRT ) . Gross tonnage is calculated based on the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship and is used to determine things such as a ship 's manning regulations , safety rules , registration fees , and port dues , whereas the older gross register tonnage is a measure of the volume of only certain enclosed spaces .",
