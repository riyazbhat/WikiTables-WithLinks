  "/wiki/Old_Swiss_Confederacy": "The Old Swiss Confederacy ( Modern German : Alte Eidgenossenschaft ; historically Eidgenossenschaft , after the Reformation also R\u00e9publique des Suisses , Res publica Helvetiorum Republic of the Swiss ) was a loose confederation of independent small states ( cantons , German Orte or St\u00e4nde ) within the Holy Roman Empire . It is the precursor of the modern state of Switzerland . It formed during the 14th century , from a nucleus in what is now Central Switzerland , expanding to include the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Berne by the middle of the century . This formed a rare union of rural and urban communes , all of which enjoyed imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire . This confederation of eight cantons ( Acht Orte ) was politically and militarily successful for more than a century , culminating in the Burgundy Wars of the 1470s which established it as a power in the complicated political landscape dominated by France and the Habsburgs . Its success resulted in the addition of more confederates , increasing the number of cantons to thirteen ( Dreizehn Orte ) by 1513 . The confederacy pledged neutrality in 1647 ( under the threat of the Thirty Years ' War ) , although many Swiss served privately as mercenaries in the Italian Wars and during the Early Modern period . After the Swabian War of 1499 the confederacy was a de facto independent state throughout the early modern period , although still nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years ' War . The Swiss Reformation divided the confederates into Reformed and Catholic parties , resulting in internal conflict from the 16th to the 18th centuries ; as a result , the federal diet ( Tagsatzung ) was often paralysed by hostility between the factions . The Swiss Confederacy fell to invasion by the French Revolutionary Army in 1798 , after which it became the short-lived Helvetic Republic .",
  "/wiki/Switzerland": "Switzerland , officially the Swiss Confederation , is a country situated in the confluence of western , central , and southern Europe . [ note 4 ] It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons , with federal authorities seated in Bern . [ note 1 ] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south , France to the west , Germany to the north , and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east . It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office . It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association , but notably not part of the European Union , the European Economic Area or the Eurozone .",

The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and took its present territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Fredrick Lugard . The British set up administrative and legal structures while practicing indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms , Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 . It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . It thereafter alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and military dictatorships until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with the 2011 presidential election considered the first to be reasonably free and fair .

  "/wiki/Harem": "Harem ( Arabic : \u062d\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u1e25ar\u012bm , a sacred inviolable place ; harem ; female members of the family ) , properly refers to domestic spaces that are reserved for the women of the house in a Muslim family . This private space has been traditionally understood as serving the purposes of maintaining the modesty , privilege , and protection of women . A harem may house a man 's wife - or wives and concubines , as in royal harems of the past - their pre-pubescent male children , unmarried daughters , female domestic workers , and other unmarried female relatives . In former times some harems were guarded by eunuchs who were allowed inside . The structure of the harem and the extent of monogamy or polygamy has varied depending on the family 's personalities , socio-economic status , and local customs . Similar institutions have been common in other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations , especially among royal and upper-class families , and the term is sometimes used in other contexts . In traditional Persian residential architecture the women 's quarters were known as andaruni , and in the Indian subcontinent as zenana . Although the institution has experienced a sharp decline in the modern era due to a rise in education and economic opportunities for women , as well as Western influences , seclusion of women is still practiced in some parts of the world , such as rural Afghanistan and conservative states of the Gulf region . In the West , Orientalist imaginary conceptions of the harem as a hidden world of sexual subjugation where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses have influenced many paintings , stage productions , films and literary works . Some earlier European Renaissance paintings dating to the 16th century portray the women of the Ottoman harem as individuals of status and political significance . In many periods of Islamic history , women in the harem exercised various degrees of political power , such as the Sultanate of Women in the Ottoman Empire .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa .

Xiamen Island possessed a natural harbor in Yundang Bay , but Fujian 's international trade was long restricted to Quanzhou or to Guangzhou in Guangdong . Due to the siltification of Quanzhou 's harbor , the British insisted that Xiamen be opened to foreign trade in the treaty that ended the First Opium War in 1842 . Under the Qing , both before and after the war , there was a large-scale emigration of Chinese from southern Fujian who spread Hokkien-speaking communities to Singapore , Malaysia ( especially in Penang ) , Indonesia ( Medan and Riau Province ) and the Philippines .

  "/wiki/British_Raj": "The British Raj ( /r\u0251\u02d0d\u0292/ ; from r\u0101j , literally , rule in Sanskrit and Hindustani ) was the rule by the British Crown on the Indian subcontinent from 1858 to 1947 . The rule is also called Crown rule in India , or direct rule in India . The region under British control was commonly called India in contemporaneous usage , and included areas directly administered by the United Kingdom , which were collectively called British India , plus those ruled by indigenous rulers , but under British tutelage or paramountcy , called the princely states . The whole was never officially called the Indian Empire , only informally . As India , it was a founding member of the League of Nations , a participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900 , 1920 , 1928 , 1932 , and 1936 , and a founding member of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945 . This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858 , when , after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria ( who , in 1876 , was proclaimed Empress of India ) . It lasted until 1947 , when it was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states : the Dominion of India ( later the Republic of India ) and the Dominion of Pakistan ( later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , the eastern part of which , still later , became the People 's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971 ) .
