  "/wiki/Music_recording_certification": "Music recording certification is a system of certifying that a music recording has shipped , sold , or streamed a certain number of units . The threshold quantity varies by type ( such as album , single , music video ) and by nation or territory ( see List of music recording certifications ) . Almost all countries follow variations of the RIAA certification categories , which are named after precious materials ( gold , platinum and diamond ) . The threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released . Typically , they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold . Different sales levels , some perhaps 10 times lower than others , may exist for different music media ( for example : videos versus albums , singles , or music download )",
  "/wiki/List_of_music_recording_certifications": "Music recording certifications are typically awarded by the worldwide music industry based on the total units sold , streamed , or shipped to retailers . These awards and their requirements are defined by the various certifying bodies representing the music industry in various countries and territories worldwide . The standard certification awards given consist of Gold , Platinum , and sometimes Diamond awards , in ascending order ; the UK also has a Silver certification , ranking below Gold . In most cases , a Multi-Platinum or Multi-Diamond award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements . Many music industries around the world are represented by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) . The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries . In some cases , the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country , but in many countries with lesser-developed industries , the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region 's music industry . Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently , such as individual record companies which service the country or region 's music industry as a whole . Though all certifying bodies give awards for album sales or shipments , many also certify singles , paid digital downloads , streaming media , music videos , music DVDs , and master ringtones . Additionally , some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins , varying genres , lengths , and formats . From the 2010s digital streaming was included in some territories",
  "/wiki/Michael_Jackson": "Michael Joseph Jackson ( August 29 , 1958 - June 25 , 2009 ) was an American singer , songwriter , and dancer .

Jackson 's contributions to music , dance , and fashion , along with his publicized personal life , made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades . His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres . The eighth child of the Jackson family , Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 . Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records , and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall ( 1979 ) . By the early 1980s , Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music . His music videos , including those for Beat It , Billie Jean , and Thriller from his sixth studio album Thriller ( 1982 ) , are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool . Their popularity helped propel the television channel MTV into a significant factor of 1980s pop culture . The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 26th Grammy Awards , including Album of the Year . Jackson continued to innovate with videos including Leave Me Alone and Smooth Criminal from Bad ( 1987 ) , Black or White and Remember the Time from Dangerous ( 1991 ) , Scream from HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I ( 1995 ) and Ghosts from the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix ( 1997 ) .

With the ongoing backlash against disco , Jackson moved in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall . Thriller features a single guest appearance , with Paul McCartney becoming the first artist to be featured on Jackson 's albums . Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles , with a production budget of $ 750,000 .

The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably , although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles . Pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s , when they became quite separated from each other . Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music , the genre is distinguished from chart music . Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as urban , dance , rock , Latin , and country ; nevertheless , there are many key elements that define pop music . Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format , also known as perrypoetry ( often the verse-chorus structure ) , as well as common use of repeated choruses , melodic tunes and hooks",
  "/wiki/Post-disco": "Post-disco is a term to describe an aftermath in popular music history circa 1979-1984 , imprecisely beginning with an unprecedented backlash against disco music in the United States , leading to civil unrest and a riot in Chicago known as the Disco Demolition Night on July 12 , 1979 , and indistinctly ending with the mainstream appearance of New Wave in the early 1980s . Disco during its dying stage displayed an increasingly electronic character that soon served as a stepping stone to new wave , old-school hip hop , euro disco and was succeeded by an underground club music called hi-NRG , which was its direct continuation . An underground movement of disco music , stripped-down , and featuring radically different sounds took place on the East Coast that was neither disco and neither R & B , This scene known as post-disco [ nb 1 ] catering to New York metropolitan area , was initially led by urban contemporary artists partially in response to the over-commercialization and artistic downfall of disco culture . Developed from the rhythm and blues sound as perfected by Parliament-Funkadelic , the electronic side of disco , dub music techniques , and other genres . Post-disco was typified by New York City music groups like D Train and Unlimited Touch who followed a more urban approach while others , like Material and ESG , a more experimental one . Post-disco was , like disco , singles-driven market controlled mostly by independent record companies that generated a cross-over chart success all through the early-to-mid 1980s . Most creative control was in the hands of record producers and club DJs which was a trend that outlived the dance-pop era . Other musical styles that emerged in the post-disco era include dance-pop , boogie , and Italo disco and led to the development of the early alternative dance , club-centered house and techno music",
  "/wiki/Funk": "Funk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic , danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music , psychedelic rock , jazz , and rhythm and blues ( R & B ) . Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer , often at slower tempos than other popular music . Like much of African-inspired music , funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that created a hypnotic and danceable feel . Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz , such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths , or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths . Funk originated in the mid-1960s , with James Brown 's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat - with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure ( The One ) , and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines , drum patterns , and guitar riffs . Other musical groups , including Sly and the Family Stone , The Meters , and Parliament-Funkadelic , soon began to adopt and develop Brown 's innovations . Notable funk women include Chaka Khan , Marva Whitney , Lyn Collins , Brides of Funkenstein , Vicki Anderson , Anna King ( The JB 's singer ) , and Parlet . Funk derivatives include the psychedelic funk of Sly Stone and George Clinton ; the avant-funk of groups such as Talking Heads and the Pop Group ; boogie , a form of post-disco dance music ; electro music , a hybrid of electronic music and funk ; funk metal ( e.g. , Living Colour , Faith No More ) ; G-funk , a mix of gangsta rap and funk ; Timba , a form of funky Cuban popular dance music ; and funk jam . Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and various forms of electronic dance music , such as house music , and Detroit techno . It is also the main influence of go-go , a subgenre associated with funk",
  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s",

Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R & B , hip-hop , urban pop , grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s .

  "/wiki/Glam_rock": "Glam rock is a style of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes , makeup , and hairstyles , particularly platform shoes and glitter . Glam artists drew on diverse sources across music and throwaway pop culture , ranging from bubblegum pop and 1950s rock and roll to cabaret , science fiction , and complex art rock . The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous , and have been described as playing with nontraditional gender roles . Glitter rock was a more extreme version of glam . The UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975 . The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC 's music show Top of the Pops , wearing glitter and satins , is often cited as the beginning of the movement . Other British glam rock artists include David Bowie , Mott the Hoople , Sweet , Slade , Mud , Roxy Music and Gary Glitter . Those not central to the genre , such as Elton John , Rod Stewart and Freddie Mercury of Queen , also adopted glam styles . In the US the scene was much less prevalent , with Alice Cooper and Lou Reed the only American artists to score a hit .

  "/wiki/Heavy_metal_music": "Heavy metal ( or simply metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and the United States . With roots in blues rock , psychedelic rock , and acid rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness . The genre 's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo . In 1968 , three of the genre 's most famous pioneers , Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded . Though they came to attract wide audiences , they were often derided by critics . Following the blueprint laid down by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath , several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s : the raw , sleazy sound and outrageous stage shows of Alice Cooper and Kiss ; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith ; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party rock of Van Halen . During the mid-1970s , Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed . Beginning in the late 1970s , bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Def Leppard followed in a similar vein . Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as metalheads or headbangers . During the 1980s , glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce . Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Slayer , Megadeth , and Anthrax , while other extreme subgenres of heavy metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena . Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre",

  "/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd , released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records . Primarily developed during live performances , the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began . New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London . The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd 's earlier recordings and performances , while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work . A concept album , its themes explore conflict , greed , time , death , and mental illness , the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member Syd Barrett , who departed the group in 1968 . The group used recording techniques such as multitrack recording , tape loops , and analogue synthesisers . Snippets from interviews with the band 's road crew , as well as philosophical quotations , were also used . Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry , who appears on The Great Gig in the Sky . The sleeve , which depicts a prism spectrum , was designed by Storm Thorgerson , following keyboardist Richard Wright 's request for a simple and bold design , representing the band 's lighting and the record 's themes . The album was promoted with two singles : Money and Us and Them . The Dark Side of the Moon received critical acclaim upon release , and has since been hailed by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time . The record reached number one on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart ( now known as the Billboard 200 ) , and has charted for over 900 weeks in total",
  "/wiki/Progressive_rock": "Progressive rock ( shortened as prog ; sometimes called art rock , classical rock or symphonic rock ) is a broad genre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid- to late 1960s . Initially termed progressive pop , the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz , folk , or classical music . Additional elements contributed to its progressive label : lyrics were more poetic , technology was harnessed for new sounds , music approached the condition of art , and the studio , rather than the stage , became the focus of musical activity , which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing . Prog is based on fusions of styles , approaches and genres , involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism . Due to its historical reception , prog 's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos , long albums , fantasy lyrics , grandiose stage sets and costumes , and an obsessive dedication to technical skill . While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture , few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree , and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music . The genre coincided with the mid-1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists , as well as the new journalistic division between pop and rock that lent generic significance to both terms . Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid-1970s , but faded soon after . Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of punk rock caused this , but several more factors contributed to the decline . Music critics , who often labelled the concepts as pretentious and the sounds as pompous and overblown , tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it . After the late 1970s , progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms . Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s ( albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures ) or crossed into symphonic pop , arena rock , or new wave",

Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States , where record labels such as Motown , Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement .

According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , soul is music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky , secular testifying . Catchy rhythms , stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves , are an important feature of soul music . Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound . The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions , twirls and auxiliary sounds . Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture . The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music , which boasted pride in being black . Soul music dominated the U.S. R & B chart in the 1960s , and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. , Britain and elsewhere .

  "/wiki/Folk_rock": "Folk rock is a hybrid music genre combining elements of folk music and rock music , which arose in the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s . In the U.S. , folk rock emerged from the folk music revival and the influence that the Beatles and other British Invasion bands had on members of that movement . Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds - several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles - attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire , adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community . The term folk rock was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds ' music . The commercial success of the Byrds ' cover version of Dylan 's Mr. Tambourine Man and their debut album of the same name , along with Dylan 's own recordings with rock instrumentation - on the albums Bringing It All Back Home ( 1965 ) , Highway 61 Revisited ( 1965 ) , and Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) - encouraged other folk acts , such as Simon & Garfunkel , to use electric backing on their records and new groups , such as Buffalo Springfield , to form . Dylan 's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965 , where he was backed by an electric band , was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre . During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe , a distinct , eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle , Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell . Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock , British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire , leading to other variants , including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock",

Well-known disco artists include Donna Summer , Gloria Gaynor , the Bee Gees , Chic , KC and the Sunshine Band , Thelma Houston , Sister Sledge , the Trammps , Village People and Michael Jackson . While performers and singers garnered public attention , record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre . Films such as Saturday Night Fever ( 1977 ) and Thank God It 's Friday ( 1978 ) contributed to disco 's mainstream popularity . Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with African Americans and also Hispanic and Latino Americans , and LGBT peoplein Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s . Disco can be seen as a reaction by the counterculture during this period to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time .
