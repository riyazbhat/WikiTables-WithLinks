During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world",

New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture .

  "/wiki/Christchurch": "Christchurch ( /\u02c8kra\u026ast\u0283\u025c\u02d0rt\u0283/ ; M\u0101ori : \u014ctautahi ) is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand and the seat of the Canterbury Region . The Christchurch urban area lies on the South Island 's east coast , just north of Banks Peninsula . The urban area is home to 377,200 residents , and the territorial authority has 385,500 people , which makes it the second-most populous city in New Zealand after Auckland and before Wellington . The Avon River flows through the centre of the city , with an urban park located along its banks . Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250 . Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856 , making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand . The Canterbury Association , which settled the Canterbury Plains , named the city after Christ Church , Oxford . The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square ; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area , except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south . Agriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch 's economy . The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city 's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries . Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities ' for Antarctic exploration , hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations . The city suffered a series of earthquakes between September 2010 and January 2012 , with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday , 22 February 2011 , in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage"
