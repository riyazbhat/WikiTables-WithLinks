There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
