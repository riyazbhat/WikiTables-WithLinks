Conceived in the 1930s as the main airport for Toronto , the construction of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission ( THC ) . At the same time , the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate , but nearby Malton ( today Toronto Pearson International Airport ) became Toronto 's main passenger airline hub instead , leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes . During the 1940s and 1950s , several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs . Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport . After the expansion , civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s . Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s , the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed . In 1983 , a 50-year tripartite agreement between the Government of Canada , the City of Toronto government and the Harbour Commission , which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines , allowed airport operations to continue .",

  "/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan": "Regina ( /r\u026a\u02c8d\u0292a\u026an\u0259/ ) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan . The city is the second-largest in the province , after Saskatoon , and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan . As of the 2016 census , Regina had a city population of 215,106 , and a Metropolitan Area population of 236,481 . It is governed by Regina City Council . The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No . 159 . Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 ."
