  "/wiki/1948_Arab-Israeli_War": "The 1948 ( or First ) Arab-Israeli War was the second and final stage of the 1947-49 Palestine war . It formally began following the end of the British Mandate for Palestine at midnight on 14 May 1948 ; the Israeli Declaration of Independence had been issued earlier that day , and a military coalition of Arab states entered the territory of British Palestine in the morning of 15 May . The first deaths of the 1947-49 Palestine war occurred on 30 November 1947 during an ambush of two buses carrying Jews . There had been tension and conflict between the Arabs and the Jews , and between each of them and the British forces since the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 creation of the British Mandate of Palestine . British policies dissatisfied both Arabs and Jews . Arabs opposition developed into the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine , while the Jewish resistance developed into the Jewish insurgency in Palestine ( 1944-1947 ) . In 1947 , these on-going tensions erupted into civil war following the 29 November 1947 adoption of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine , which planned to divide Palestine into an Arab state , a Jewish state , and the Special International Regime encompassing the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem . On 15 May 1948 , the civil war transformed into a conflict between Israel and the Arab states following the Israeli Declaration of Independence the previous day . Egypt , Transjordan , Syria , and expeditionary forces from Iraq entered Palestine . The invading forces took control of the Arab areas and immediately attacked Israeli forces and several Jewish settlements . The 10 months of fighting took place mostly on the territory of the British Mandate and in the Sinai Peninsula and southern Lebanon , interrupted by several truce periods . As a result of the war , the State of Israel controlled the area that UN General Assembly Resolution 181 had recommended for the proposed Jewish state , as well as almost 60-percent of the area of Arab state proposed by the 1947 Partition Plan , including the Jaffa , Lydda , and Ramle area , Galilee , some parts of the Negev , a wide strip along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road , West Jerusalem , and some territories in the West Bank .",

  "/wiki/Emmanuel_Landau": "Emmanuel ( Emil ) Landau was a Palmach fighter who was rewarded with the Hero of Israel . He was born on November 10 , 1928 in Warsaw , Poland . He and his younger sister fled from Poland to the Soviet Union on the eve of the outbreak of World War II . His father fell ill during his service in the Red Army , and died before the end of the war . His mother Fania handed him and his sister Elina ( later Ilana ) to a Christian orphanage , because she could not support them . A few months later , an emissary from Youth Aliyah arrived at the orphanage to take the Jewish children . This was the result of an agreement signed in 1942 between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet government , in which 120,000 Polish soldiers and refugees from the Soviet Union were allowed to transfer to British-controlled Tehran . Emil and Elina were among approximately 1,000 Jewish children who were taken by train to Tehran . The children , most of whom arrived with no parents , were housed in an orphanage set up for them . In 1943 , Emmanuel and his sister immigrated to Mandatory Palestine among a group of Jewish children in Tehran . After spending a short time at the Youth Aliyah camp in Jerusalem , Emil and Elina moved to the kibbutz Ginegar . During his stay at the Kibbutz , Emmanuel was discovered to be a great talent and a leader .",

  "/wiki/Bren": "The Bren gun , usually called simply the Bren , is a series of light machine guns ( LMG ) made by Britain in the 1930s and used in various roles until 1992 . While best known for its role as the British and Commonwealth forces ' primary infantry LMG in World War II , it was also used in the Korean War and saw service throughout the latter half of the 20th century , including the 1982 Falklands War . Although fitted with a bipod , it could also be mounted on a tripod or vehicle-mounted . The Bren was a licensed version of the Czechoslovak ZGB 33 light machine gun which , in turn , was a modified version of the ZB vz . 26 , which British Army officials had tested during a firearms service competition in the 1930s . The later Bren featured a distinctive top-mounted curved box magazine , conical flash hider , and quick change barrel . The name Bren was derived from Brno , the Czechoslovak city in Moravia , where the Zb vz . 26 was designed ( in the Zbrojovka Brno Factory ) and Enfield , site of the British Royal Small Arms Factory . The designer was V\u00e1clav Holek , a gun inventor and design engineer . In the 1950s , many Brens were re-barrelled to accept the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and modified to feed from the magazine for the L1 ( Commonwealth version of the FN FAL ) rifle as the L4 light machine gun . It was replaced in the British Army as the section LMG by the L7 general-purpose machine gun ( GPMG ) , a heavier belt-fed weapon . This was supplemented in the 1980s by the L86 Light Support Weapon firing the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round , leaving the Bren in use only as a pintle mount on some vehicles .",
  "/wiki/Jerusalem": "Jerusalem [ note 2 ] is a city in the Middle East , located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea . It is one of the oldest cities in the world , and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . [ note 3 ] During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , captured and recaptured 44 times , and attacked 52 times . The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries . In 2015 , Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents , comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis , 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians .",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea .
