  "/wiki/Covenant_(law)": "A covenant in its most general sense and historical sense , is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action . Under historical English common law a covenant was distinguished from an ordinary contract by the presence of a seal . Because the presence of a seal indicated an unusual solemnity in the promises made in a covenant , the common law would enforce a covenant even in the absence of consideration . In United States contract law , an implied covenant of good faith is presumed . A covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a contractual condition . The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to perform ( affirmative covenant ( US ) / positive covenant ( E & W ) ) or to refrain from ( negative covenant ) some action . In real property law , the juristic term real covenants means conditions tied to the ownership or use of land . A covenant running with the land , meeting tests of wording and circumstances laid down in precedent , imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner . Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes , leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified ; in the US the Restatement ( Third ) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes . Real covenant law in the US has been referred to as an unspeakable quagmire by one court . Covenants for title are covenants which come with a deed or title to the property , in which the grantor of the title makes certain guarantees to the grantee . Non-compete clauses in the United States are also called restrictive covenants .",
