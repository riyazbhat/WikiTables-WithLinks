He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era , one whose poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw , which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising . At 21 , he settled in Paris . Thereafter - in the last 18 years of his life - he gave only 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries ( including Robert Schumann ) . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837 , he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin ( known by her pen name , George Sand ) . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838-39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition . In his final years , he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . For most of his life , Chopin was in poor health",
  "/wiki/Ballades_(Chopin)": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin 's four ballades are single-movement pieces for solo piano , composed between 1831 and 1842 . They are considered to be some of the most challenging pieces in the standard piano repertoire . The term ballade was used by Chopin in the sense of a balletic interlude or dance-piece , equivalent to the old Italian ballata , but the term may also have connotations of the medieval heroic ballad , a narrative minstrel-song , often of a fantastical character . There are dramatic and dance-like elements in Chopin 's use of the genre , and he may be said to be a pioneer of the ballade as an abstract musical form . The four ballades are said to have been inspired by poet Adam Mickiewicz . The exact inspiration for each individual ballade , however , is unclear and disputed . Though the ballades do not conform exactly to sonata form , the ballade form created by Chopin for his four ballades is a distinct variant of sonata form with specific discrepancies , such as the mirror reprise ( presenting the two expositional themes in reverse order during the recapitulation ) . [ citation needed ] The ballades have directly influenced composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms who , after Chopin , wrote ballades of their own . Besides sharing the title , the four ballades are entities distinct from each other . According to composer and music critic Louis Ehlert , Each [ ballade ] differs entirely from the others , and they have but one thing in common - their romantic working out and the nobility of their motifs . Modern theorists have shown , however , that the ballades do have much in common , such as the ballade meter ( 64 or 68 ) and certain formal practices like the mirror reprise and delaying the structural dominant . The four ballades are among the most enduring of Chopin 's compositions and are frequently performed in concerts",
  "/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen": "God Save the Queen ( alternatively God Save the King , depending on the gender of the reigning monarch ) is the royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms , their territories , and the British Crown dependencies . The author of the tune is unknown , and it may originate in plainchant ; but an attribution to the composer John Bull is sometimes made . God Save the Queen is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977 , as well as for several of the UK 's territories that have their own additional local anthem . It is also the royal anthem - played specifically in the presence of the monarch - of all the aforementioned countries , as well as Australia ( since 1984 ) , Canada ( since 1980 ) , Barbados and Tuvalu . In countries not previously part of the British Empire , the tune of God Save the Queen has provided the basis for various patriotic songs , though still generally connected with royal ceremony . The melody continues to be used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein , Oben am jungen Rhein , and the royal anthem of Norway , Kongesangen . In the United States , the melody is used for the patriotic song My Country , 'T is of Thee ( also known as America ) . Beyond its first verse , which is consistent , God Save the Queen/King has many historic and extant versions . Since its first publication , different verses have been added and taken away and , even today , different publications include various selections of verses in various orders . In general , only one verse is sung . Sometimes two verses are sung , and on rare occasions , three . The sovereign and her or his spouse are saluted with the entire composition , while other members of the royal family who are entitled to royal salute ( such as the Prince of Wales , Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex along with their spouses ) receive just the first six bars",

  "/wiki/Polonaise-Fantaisie_(Chopin)": "The Polonaise-fantaisie in A-flat major , Op . 61 , is a composition for piano by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin . It was dedicated to Mme A. Veyret , written and published in 1846 . It opens with Allegro maestoso , 34 time . This work was slow to gain favor with musicians , due to its harmonic complexity and intricate form . Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak positively of the work , writing in 1947 that it 'works on the hearer 's imagination with a power of suggestion equaled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade ' , although Arthur Rubinstein , Leff Pouishnoff , Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz had been including it in their programs some decades earlier . It is intimately indebted to the polonaise for its metre , much of its rhythm , and some of its melodic character , but the fantaisie is the operative formal paradigm [ clarification needed ] ( Samson , 1988 ) , and Chopin is said to have referred initially to the piece only as a Fantasy . Parallels with the Fantaisie in F minor include the work 's overall tonality , A-flat , the key of its slower middle section , B major , and the motive of the descending fourth",

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era . Schumann left the study of law , intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist . His teacher , Friedrich Wieck , a German pianist , had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe , but a hand injury ended this dream . Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing . In 1840 , after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck , who opposed the marriage , Schumann married Wieck 's daughter Clara . A lifelong partnership in music began , as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy . Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer Johannes Brahms . Until 1840 , Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano . Later , he composed piano and orchestral works , and many Lieder ( songs for voice and piano ) . He composed four symphonies , one opera , and other orchestral , choral , and chamber works . His best-known works include Carnaval , Symphonic Studies , Kinderszenen , Kreisleriana , and the Fantasie in C.

Born into a musical family , Rachmaninoff took up the piano at the age of four . He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1892 , having already composed several piano and orchestral pieces . In 1897 , following the negative critical reaction to his Symphony No . 1 , Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received Piano Concerto No . 2 in 1901 . In the course of the next sixteen years , Rachmaninoff conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre , relocated to Dresden , Germany , and toured the United States for the first time . Rachmaninoff often featured the piano in his compositions , and he explored the expressive possibilities of the instrument through his own skills as a pianist .

Scriabin , who was influenced early in his life by the works of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , composed works that are characterised by a highly tonal idiom ( these works are associated with his first stage of compositional output ) . Later in his career , independently of Arnold Schoenberg , Scriabin developed a substantially atonal and much more dissonant musical system , which accorded with his personal brand of mysticism . [ citation needed ] Scriabin was influenced by synesthesia , and associated colours with the various harmonic tones of his atonal scale , while his colour-coded circle of fifths was also influenced by theosophy . He is considered by some to be the main Russian Symbolist composer . Scriabin was one of the most innovative and most controversial of early modern composers . The Great Soviet Encyclopedia said of Scriabin that no composer has had more scorn heaped on him or greater love bestowed . Leo Tolstoy described Scriabin 's music as a sincere expression of genius . Scriabin had a major impact on the music world over time , and influenced composers such as Igor Stravinsky , Sergei Prokofiev , and Karol Szymanowski .

He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations , and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor . Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 .

From an early age , Busoni was an outstanding if sometimes controversial pianist . He studied at the Vienna Conservatory and then with Wilhelm Mayer and Carl Reinecke . After brief periods teaching in Helsinki , Boston , and Moscow , he devoted himself to composing , teaching , and touring as a virtuoso pianist in Europe and the United States . His writings on music were influential , and covered not only aesthetics but considerations of microtones and other innovative topics . He was based in Berlin from 1894 but spent much of World War I in Switzerland . He began composing in his early years in a late romantic style , but after 1907 , when he published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music , he developed a more individual style , often with elements of atonality . His visits to America led to interest in North American indigenous tribal melodies which were reflected in some of his works . His compositions include works for piano , among them a monumental Piano Concerto , and transcriptions of the works of others , notably Johann Sebastian Bach ( published as the Bach-Busoni Editions ) .

Despite his short lifetime , Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre , including more than 600 secular vocal works ( mainly lieder ) , seven complete symphonies , sacred music , operas , incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music . His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major , D. 667 ( Trout Quintet ) , the Symphony No . 8 in B minor , D. 759 ( Unfinished Symphony ) , the Great Symphony No . 9 in C major , D. 944 , the three last piano sonatas ( D. 958-960 ) , the opera Fierrabras ( D. 796 ) , the incidental music to the play Rosamunde ( D. 797 ) , and the song cycles Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin ( D. 795 ) and Winterreise ( D. 911 ) .

His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons , but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities . In 1808 , at the age of eleven , he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school , where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn , Mozart , and Beethoven . He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813 , and returned home to live with his father , where he began studying to become a schoolteacher ; despite this , he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically . In 1821 , Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member , which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry . He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828 , the only time he did so in his career . He died eight months later at the age of 31 , the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever , but believed by some historians to be syphilis",
  "/wiki/Impromptus_(Schubert)": "Franz Schubert 's Impromptus are a series of eight pieces for solo piano composed in 1827 .

The third and fourth pieces in the first set were published in 1857 ( although the third piece was printed by the publisher in G major , instead of G\u266d as Schubert had written it , and remained available only in this key for many years ) . The two sets are now catalogued as D. 899 and D. 935 respectively . They are considered to be among the most important examples of this popular early 19th-century genre . Three other unnamed piano compositions ( D. 946 ) , written in May 1828 , a few months before the composer 's death , are known as both Impromptus and Klavierst\u00fccke ( piano pieces ) .
