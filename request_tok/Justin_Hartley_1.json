  "/wiki/Green_Arrow": "Green Arrow is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics . Created by Mort Weisinger and designed by George Papp , he first appeared in More Fun Comics # 73 in November 1941 . His real name is Oliver Jonas Queen , a wealthy businessman and owner of Queen Industries who is also a well-known celebrity in Star City . He uses this position to hide the fact that he is the Arrow . Sometimes shown dressed like the character Robin Hood , Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle , as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League . Though much less frequently used in modern stories , he also deploys a range of trick arrows ( in contemporary times , they are referred as specialty arrows ) with various special functions , such as glue , explosive-tipped , grappling hook , flash grenade , tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations . At the time of his debut , Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character , but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of left-wing politics very much distinct in character from Batman . Green Arrow enjoyed moderate success in his early years , becoming the cover feature of More Fun , as well as having occasional appearances in other comics . Throughout his first twenty-five years , however , the character never enjoyed greater popularity . In the late 1960s , writer Denny O'Neil , inspired by the character 's dramatic visual redesign by Neal Adams , chose to have him lose his fortune , giving him the then-unique role of a streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged . In 1970 , he was paired with a more law and order-oriented hero , Green Lantern , in a ground-breaking , socially conscious comic book series . Since then , he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban , gritty approach to the character .",

  "/wiki/Aquaman": "Aquaman ( Arthur Curry ) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger , the character debuted in More Fun Comics # 73 ( November 1941 ) . Initially a backup feature in DC 's anthology titles , Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series . During the late 1950s ' and 1960s ' superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age , he was a founding member of the Justice League . In the 1990s ' Modern Age , writers interpreted Aquaman 's character more seriously , with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis . The character 's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression , making Aquaman widely recognized in popular culture and one of the world 's most recognized superheroes . Jokes about his wholesome , weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines , leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books . Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception , with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding , saddled with an ill reputation , and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero . Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations , first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program . Since then he has appeared in various animated productions , including prominent roles in the 2000s series Justice League and Justice League Unlimited and Batman : The Brave and the Bold , as well as several DC Universe Animated Original Movies . Actor Alan Ritchson also portrayed the character in the live-action television show Smallville . In the DC Extended Universe , actor Jason Momoa portrays the character in the films Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , Justice League , and Aquaman .",
