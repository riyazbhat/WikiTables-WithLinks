Inaugurated in its current form by Mayor Arsenio Lacson in 1961 , it is named after Jos\u00e9 Sandino y Miranda , who served as the Philippines ' Secretary of the Treasury between 1833 and 1854 . Regarded as the center of Philippine political discourse prior to the imposition of martial law in 1972 , the plaza was the site of the 1971 Plaza Miranda bombing , where two grenades were launched at a political rally of the Liberal Party , killing nine people . It underwent a \u20b149 million renovation in 2000 after decades of neglect as a result of Manila 's urban decay in the 1970s and 1980s , giving it a more modern design despite protests from various historical groups and cultural experts , with a monument erected to commemorate bombing victims and additional architectural elements installed . Currently , Plaza Miranda serves as a freedom park , where assemblies and protests may be held without needing a permit from local authorities , and with thousands of people crossing through it every day , it is considered to be Manila 's version of Times Square . Despite fronting the Quiapo Church , Plaza Miranda and the streets surrounding it is known as a center for fortune-telling and the sale of lucky charms and amulets . Most fortune tellers who practice around Plaza Miranda claim that they are able to draw their ability to tell fortunes from their devotion to the Black Nazarene ( the patron of the Quiapo Church ) despite Catholic Church doctrine deploring the practice",

  "/wiki/Rajah_Sulayman": "Rajah Sulayman , sometimes referred to as Sulayman III ( Sanskrit : \u0938\u094d\u0932\u0932\u0948\u0905\u0939\u094d , Baybayin : \u1710\u1713\u170e\u170c\u1714\u170b\u1708\u1714 , Abecedario : Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n ) ( 1558-1575 ) , was the Rajah or paramount ruler of the Rajahnate of Maynila , a fortified Tagalog Muslim polity which was a vassal to the Brunei Sultanate , on the southern half of the Pasig River delta , by the time Spanish colonizers arrived in the early 1570s . Sulayman - along with his co-ruler Rajah Matanda of Maynila and Lakan Dula , who ruled the neighboring polity of Tondo - was one of three monarchs who figured most significantly in the Spanish conquest of the Port of Manila and the Pasig River delta . Spanish accounts describe him as the most aggressive of the three rulers - a characteristic chalked up to his youth relative to the other two rulers . He was penultimate indigenous paramount ruler ( Rajah ) in the Pasig River Delta era : his adoptive son , baptized Agustin de Legaspi upon conversion to Christianity , was proclaimed Paramount ruler of Tondo upon the death of Lakan Dula , but he , along with most of Lakan Dula 's sons and most of Sulayman 's adoptive sons were executed by the Spanish after being implicated in the 1587-1588 Tondo Conspiracy , helping the Spanish Empire to further solidify its grip on Luzon and most of the Philippine archipelago",
  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Maynila": "In early Philippine history , the Tagalog Bayan ( country or polity ) of Maynila ( Filipino : Bayan ng Maynila ; Baybayin : \u170a\u170c\u1708\u1714 \u1705\u1714 \u170b\u170c\u1714\u1708\u1712\u170e ; Kapampangan : Balen ning Menila ) was a major trade hub located on the southern part of the Pasig River delta , where the modern day district of Intramuros currently stands . Historical texts indicate that it was led by paramount rulers who used the title Rajah , but the introduction of hispanized literary forms have led to it sometimes being inappropriately referred to as the Kingdom of Maynila . Some early historic texts also refer to it as the Kingdom of Luzon , although scholarship suggests that the latter term might actually refer to the Manila Bay region as a whole , rather than just Maynila . The earliest oral traditions suggest that Maynila was founded as a Muslim principality as early as the 1250s , supplanting an even older pre-Muslim settlement . However , the earliest archeological evidence for organized human settlements in the area dates to around 1500 . By the 16th century , it had become an important trading center , with extensive political ties with the Sultanate of Brunei and extensive trade relations with Ming dynasty . Together with Tondo , the polity ( bayan ) on the northern part of the Pasig River delta , it established a shared monopoly on the trade of Chinese goods . Maynila and Luzon are sometimes associated with the Bruneian legends which describe a settlement called Seludong , but Southeast Asian scholars believe this refers to a settlement Mount Selurong in Indonesia . For political reasons , the historical rulers of Maynila maintained close cognatic ties through intermarriage with the ruling houses of the Sultanate of Brunei , but Brunei 's political influence over Maynila is not considered to have extended to military or political rule . Intermarriage was a common strategy for large thassalocratic states such as Brunei to extend their influence , and for local rulers such as those of Maynila to help strengthen their family claims to nobility . Actual political and military rule over the large distances characteristic of Maritime Southeast Asia was not possible until relatively modern times . By 1570 , Maynila was under the rule of two paramount rulers ( the more senior Rajah Matanda and the younger Rajah Sulayman ) , who in turn had several lower-ranked rulers ( Datu ) under them",
