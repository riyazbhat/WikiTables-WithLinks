  "/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone": "Dihydrotestosterone ( DHT , 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone , 5\u03b1-DHT , androstanolone or stanolone ) is an endogenous androgen sex steroid and hormone .

This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 double bond of testosterone . Relative to testosterone , DHT is considerably more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor ( AR ) . In addition to its role as a natural hormone , DHT has been used as a medication , for instance in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men ; for information on DHT as a medication , see the androstanolone article .",
