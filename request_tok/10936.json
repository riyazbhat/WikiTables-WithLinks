It had a population of 330,100 ( 1999 Census ) , up 9 % from 1989 , making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country , after Nur-Sultan and Turkistan . One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan and in Transoxania , built and populated by the ancient Sogdians , Taraz celebrated its official 2000th anniversary ( recognized by UNESCO ) in 2001 , dating from a fortress built in the area by a Xiongnu Chanyu named Zhizhi and was a site of the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BCE . The city was first recorded under the name Talas in 568 CE by Menander Protector . The medieval city of Talas was a major trade centre along the Silk Road . Talas was later described by Xuanzang , who passed Talas in 629 and later wrote : Traveling westward from the Thousand Springs 140 or 150 li , we come to the city of Daluosi . The city is 8 or 9 li in diameter ; and was settled by Hu ( foreign , non-Oriental ) merchants from various nations . The products and the climate are about the same as Suyab . The Talas alphabet , a variant of the Turkic runiform Orkhon script , is named for the town . Talas secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas ( 751 CE ) , which was fought between forces of the Chinese Tang Dynasty and those of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate . The battle took place somewhere along the Talas River in the Talas valley . One of its indirect outcomes was the introduction of paper to the west , via the Arab capture of Chinese paper makers .",
