Ivory Coast 's political capital is Yamoussoukro in the centre of the country , while its economic capital and largest city is the port city of Abidjan . It borders Guinea to the northwest , Liberia to the west , Mali to the northwest , Burkina Faso to the northeast , Ghana to the east , and the Gulf of Guinea ( Atlantic Ocean ) to the south . The official language of the republic is French , with local indigenous languages also being widely used that include Baoul\u00e9 , Dioula , Dan , Anyin , and Cebaara Senufo . In total , there are around 78 different languages spoken in Ivory Coast . The country has large populations of Muslims , Christians ( primarily Roman Catholics ) and various indigenous religions . Before its colonization by Europeans , Ivory Coast was home to several states , including Gyaaman , the Kong Empire and Baoul\u00e9 . The area became a protectorate of France in 1843 and was consolidated as a French colony in 1893 amid the European scramble for Africa . It achieved independence in 1960 , led by F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny , who ruled the country until 1993 . Relatively stable by regional standards , Ivory Coast established close political and economic ties with its West African neighbors while at the same time maintaining close relations to the West , especially France . Ivory Coast experienced a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1999 and two religiously-grounded civil wars , first between 2002 and 2007 and again during 2010-2011 . In 2000 , the country adopted a new constitution .",
  "/wiki/Eora_language": "The Sydney language , also referred to as Darug or Iyora ( Eora ) English , is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Yuin-Kuric group that was traditionally spoken in the region of Sydney , New South Wales .

New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton .

Some have expressed the opinion that the language is an important part of Cornish identity , culture and heritage . Cornish is currently recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages . It has a growing number of second language speakers . A few parents are inspired to create new first language speakers , by teaching their children the language from birth . Along with Welsh and Breton , Cornish is descended directly from the Common Brittonic language spoken throughout much of Great Britain before the English language came to dominate . It was the main language of Cornwall for centuries until it was pushed westwards by English , maintaining close links with its sister language Breton , with which it was mutually intelligible until well into the Middle Ages . Cornish continued to function as a common community language in parts of Cornwall until the mid 18th century . There is some evidence of knowledge of the language persisting into the 19th century , possibly almost overlapping the beginning of revival efforts .

  "/wiki/Weyto_language": "Weyto is a speculative extinct language thought to have been spoken in the Lake Tana region of Ethiopia by the Weyto , a small group of hippopotamus hunters who now speak Amharic . The Weyto language was first mentioned by the Scottish traveler James Bruce , who spoke Amharic , passed through the area about 1770 and reported that the Wayto speak a language radically different from any of those in Abyssinia , but was unable to obtain any certain information on it , despite prevailing upon the king to send for two Weyto men for him to ask questions , which they would neither answer nor understand even when threatened with hanging . The next European to report on them , Eugen Mittwoch , described them as uniformly speaking a dialect of Amharic ( Mittwoch 1907 ) . This report was confirmed by Marcel Griaule when he passed through in 1928 , although he added that at one point a Weyto sang an unrecorded song in the dead language of the Wohitos whose meaning the singer himself did not understand , except for a handful of words for hippopotamus body parts which , he says , had remained in use . This Amharic dialect is described by Marcel Cohen ( 1939 ) as featuring a fair number of words derived from Amharic roots but twisted in sound or meaning in order to confuse outsiders , making it a sort of argot ; in addition to these , it had a small number of Cushitic loanwords not found in standard Amharic , and a large number of Arabic loanwords mainly related to Islam . Of the substantial wordlist collected by Griaule , Cohen only considered six terms to be etymologically obscure : \u0161\u0259lk\u0259r\u00edt fish-scale , q\u0259ntat wing , \u010d\u0259g\u0259mbit mosquito , annessa shoulder , \u0259nkies hippopotamus thigh , waz\u0259m\u0259s hippopotamus spine . By 1965 , the visiting anthropologist Frederick Gamst found no surviving native words , not even relating to their hunting and fishing work tasks . ( Gamst 1965 . ) The paucity of the data available has not prevented speculation on the classification of their original language ; Cohen suggested that it might have been either an Agaw language or a non-Amharic Semitic language , while Dimmendaal ( 1989 ) says it probably belonged to Cushitic ( as does Agaw ) , and Gamst ( 1965 ) says .it can be assumed that if the W\u00e4yto did not speak Amharic 200 years ago , their language must have been Ag\u00e4w . According to the Ethnologue , Bender et al . ( 1976 ) saw it as Cushitic , while Bender 1983 saw it as either Eastern Sudanic or Awngi . It thus effectively remains unclassified , largely for lack of data , but possibly related to Agaw .",
  "/wiki/Unclassified_languages": "An unclassified language is a language whose genetic affiliation to other languages has not been established . Languages can be unclassified for a variety of reasons , mostly due to a lack of reliable data but sometimes due to the confounding influence of language contact , if different layers of its vocabulary or morphology point in different directions and it is not clear which represents the ancestral form of the language . Some poorly known extinct languages , such as Gutian and Cac\u00e1n , are simply unclassifiable , and it is unlikely the situation will ever change . A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all , or even a distinct dialect , but merely a family , tribal or village name , or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified . If a language 's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families , as in the case of Basque in Europe , it is considered a language isolate - that is , it is classified as a language family of its own . An 'unclassified ' language therefore is one which may still turn out to belong to an established family once better data is available or more thorough comparative research is done . Extinct unclassified languages for which little evidence has been preserved are likely to remain in limbo indefinitely , unless lost documents or a surviving speaking population are discovered .",

Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours .

Turkic languages are spoken as a native language by some 170 million people , and the total number of Turkic speakers , including second language speakers , is over 200 million . The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish , spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans ; its native speakers account for about 40 % of all Turkic speakers . Characteristic features such as vowel harmony , agglutination , and lack of grammatical gender , are universal within the Turkic family . There is also a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages , which include Turkish , Azerbaijani , Turkmen , Qashqai , Gagauz , Balkan Gagauz Turkish and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar . Although methods of classification vary , the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches : Oghur , the only surviving member of which is Chuvash , and Common Turkic , which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch . Turkic languages show some similarities with the Mongolic , Tungusic , Koreanic and Japonic languages . These similarities led some linguists to propose an Altaic language family , though this proposal is widely rejected by historical linguists . Apparent similarities with the Uralic languages even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the Ural-Altaic hypothesis . However , there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies , the shared characteristics between the languages being attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact .",
  "/wiki/Black_Sea": "The Black Sea is a body of water and marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean between Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , and Western Asia . It is supplied by a number of major rivers , such as the Danube , Dnieper , Southern Bug , Dniester , Don , and the Rioni . The watersheds of many countries drain into the Black Sea beyond the six that immediately border it . The Black Sea has an area of 436,400 km2 ( 168,500 sq mi ) ( not including the Sea of Azov ) , a maximum depth of 2,212 m ( 7,257 ft ) , and a volume of 547,000 km3 ( 131,000 cu mi ) . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south , Caucasus Mountains to the east , Crimean Mountains to the north , Strandzha to the southwest , Balkan Mountains to the west , Dobrogea Plateau to the northwest , and features a wide shelf to the northwest . The longest east-west extent is about 1,175 km ( 730 mi ) . Important cities along the coast include Odessa , Sevastopol , Samsun , and Istanbul . The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine , Romania , Bulgaria , Turkey , Georgia , and Russia . It has a positive water balance ; that is , a net outflow of water 300 km3 ( 72 cu mi ) per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea . There is a two-way hydrological exchange : the more saline and therefore denser , but warmer , Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow . This creates a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters . The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea , via the Aegean Sea and various straits , and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean .",

With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5 % of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

As a Goidelic language , Scottish Gaelic , like Modern Irish and Manx , developed out of Old Irish . It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period , although a common literary language was shared by Gaels in both Ireland and Scotland down to the 16th century . Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking , as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames . In the 2011 census of Scotland , 57,375 people ( 1.1 % of the Scottish population aged over three years old ) reported as able to speak Gaelic , 1,275 fewer than in 2001 . The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides . Nevertheless , there are revival efforts , and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses .

The Slavic languages are conventionally ( that is , also on the basis of extralinguistic features ) divided intro three subgroups : East , West , and South , which together constitute more than 20 languages . Of these , 10 have at least one million speakers and official status as the national languages of the countries in which they are predominantly spoken : Russian , Belarusian and Ukrainian ( of the East group ) , Polish , Czech and Slovak ( of the West group ) and Bulgarian and Macedonian ( eastern dialects of the South group ) , and Serbo-Croatian and Slovene ( western dialects of the South group ) . The current geographic distribution of natively spoken Slavic languages covers Eastern Europe , the Balkans , Central Europe and all of the territory of Russia , which includes northern and north-central Asia . Furthermore , the diasporas of many Slavic peoples have established isolated minorities of speakers of their languages all over the world .

As part of the proposed Den\u00e9-Yeniseian language family , the Yeniseian languages have been part of the first demonstration of a genealogical link between Old World and New World language families that meets the standards of traditional comparative-historical linguistics . The only surviving language of the group today is Ket . From hydronymic and genetic data , it is suggested that the Yeniseian languages were spoken in a much greater area in ancient times , including parts of northern China and Mongolia . It has been further proposed that the recorded distribution of Yeniseian languages from the 17th century onward represents a relatively recent northward migration , and that the Yeniseian urheimat lies to the south of Lake Baikal . The Yeniseians have been connected to the Xiongnu , whose ruling elite are thought to have spoken a southern Yeniseian language similar to Pumpokol . The Jie , who ruled the Later Zhao state of northern China , are likewise believed to have spoken a Pumpokolic language based on linguistic and ethnogeographic data . Yeniseian languages are thought to have contributed many ubiquitous loanwords to Turkic and Mongolic vocabulary , such as Khan , Khagan , Tarqan , and the word for god and sky , Tengri .

  "/wiki/Language_isolate": "A language isolate , in the absolute sense , is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical ( or genetic ) relationship with other languages , one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language . Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language . Commonly cited examples include Ainu , Basque , Sumerian , Elamite , and Vedda , though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages . Some sources use the term language isolate to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member . For instance , Albanian , Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates . While part of the Indo-European family , they do not belong to any established branch ( such as the Romance , Indo-Iranian , Celtic , Slavic or Germanic branches ) , but instead form independent branches . Similarly , within the Romance languages , Sardinian is a relative isolate . However , without a qualifier , isolate is understood to mean having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language . Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families . This happened with Japanese ( now included in the Japonic family along with Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan ) and Korean in Koreanic languages with Jeju language . The Etruscan language of Italy has long been considered an isolate , but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called Tyrsenian languages , an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by Helmut Rix in 1998 , including the Rhaetian language , formerly spoken in the central Alps , and the Lemnian language , formerly spoken on the Greek island of Lemnos .

  "/wiki/Unclassified_language": "An unclassified language is a language whose genetic affiliation to other languages has not been established . Languages can be unclassified for a variety of reasons , mostly due to a lack of reliable data but sometimes due to the confounding influence of language contact , if different layers of its vocabulary or morphology point in different directions and it is not clear which represents the ancestral form of the language . Some poorly known extinct languages , such as Gutian and Cac\u00e1n , are simply unclassifiable , and it is unlikely the situation will ever change . A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all , or even a distinct dialect , but merely a family , tribal or village name , or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified . If a language 's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families , as in the case of Basque in Europe , it is considered a language isolate - that is , it is classified as a language family of its own . An 'unclassified ' language therefore is one which may still turn out to belong to an established family once better data is available or more thorough comparative research is done . Extinct unclassified languages for which little evidence has been preserved are likely to remain in limbo indefinitely , unless lost documents or a surviving speaking population are discovered .",

Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",
  "/wiki/Classical_Gaelic": "Classical Gaelic ( Scottish Gaelic : G\u00e0idhlig Chlasaigeach ; Irish : Gaeilge Chlasaiceach ) was the shared literary form that was in use in Scotland and Ireland from the 13th century to the 18th century . The language may be thought of as a high-register version of Early Modern Irish . Although the first written signs of Scottish Gaelic having diverged from Irish appear as far back as the 12th century annotations of the Book of Deer , Scottish Gaelic did not have a standardised form and did not appear in print on a significant scale until the 1767 translation of the New Testament into Scottish Gaelic although John Carswell 's Foirm na n-Urrnuidheadh , an adaptation of John Knox 's Book of Common Order , was the first book printed in either Scottish or Irish Gaelic ."
