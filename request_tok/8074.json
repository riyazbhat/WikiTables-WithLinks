  "/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The Popular Democratic Party ( Spanish : Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico , PPD ) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates to continue as a Commonwealth of the United States with self-government . [ a ] [ b ] The party was founded in 1938 by dissidents from the Puerto Rican Liberal Party and the Unionist Party and originally promoted policies on the center-left . [ c ] In recent years , however , its leaders have described the party as centrist . [ d ] [ e ] As one of the long-standing parties on the island , the PPD has played a significant role in the history of Puerto Rico . In the early 1950s , for example , the party held a majority in the delegation convened to draft the Constitution of Puerto Rico . Once the constitution was ratified , the document was proclaimed by the party 's leader and co-founder , Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn - who , in doing so , became the first Puerto Rican governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico . The party ruled all branches of the Puerto Rican government afterward for 36 of the past 68 years , while establishing many of the institutions that permeate Puerto Rican society today . Today , the party is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength . In the executive branch , the party 's last governor was Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla who governed the island from 2013-2017 . It also holds minorities in the legislative and judicial branches by holding minorities in the Senate , in the House , and in the Supreme Court . The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , however , is from the PPD ; a circumstance that allows the party to designate political appointees in the judicial branch since the Chief Justice is also constitutionally the chief judicial administrator . Finally , in the municipal landscape , the party holds more than half of the seats of mayors .",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

  "/wiki/New_Progressive_Party_of_Puerto_Rico": "The New Progressive Party ( Spanish : Partido Nuevo Progresista , PNP ) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates statehood . The PNP is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength and currently holds both the seat of the governor and of the resident commissioner . In legislative matters , the party has a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives ; a majority that gives the party full control over all legislations , including constitutional amendments , without political opposition . These majorities over the legislative branch , the control over the governorship seat , and a majority of Supreme Court justices affiliated with the party give the PNP absolute control over all three branches of government without political opposition . The party , however , has a minority in the number of mayors on the island . Domestically , the party is primarily contrasted by two other political parties : the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD ) , which advocates maintaining the current political status of Puerto Rico as that of an unincorporated territory of the United States with self-government , and the smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) , which advocates for the independence of Puerto Rico . [ a ] [ b ] In national/mainland politics , members are split , with some party members affiliating with the Republican Party and some with the Democratic Party . The party traces its history back to 1967 . In that year , the Partido Estadista Republicano instructed its members to not participate in a referendum held that year . Unhappy with the mandate , several dissidents left the Statehood Party and founded the PNP afterwards .",

Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions .
