  "/wiki/Aarhus_Historic_Shipwreck": "In Australia , Aarhus Historic Shipwreck is a historical site preserving one of the victims of Smith 's Rock . The Aarhus was a 640-tonne sailing barque built in 1875 in Hamburg , Germany . She was 170 feet ( 52 m ) long . While carrying a general cargo including kerosene from New York to Brisbane , Australia , she hit Smith 's Rock , which lies about two nautical miles ( 4 km ) north-east of Cape Moreton , and sank on 24 February 1894 . The remains of the ship now lie upright in 20 metres of water , though most of the ship has been reduced to plates and ribs sticking out of the sand . It has been gazetted under Section 7 of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 which provides for a special protected zone of 200m around the wreck . Any disturbance activity is prohibited ; divers are required to apply to the director of the Queensland Museum for a permit to access the wreck . The Esperance Star and the MV Nautilus both currently hold permits to dive this historic wreck . This site has lots of interesting life , from macro to large batfish at cleaning stations everywhere . Another point of interest is the large mast-like object that is actually the bowsprit . This area has a cat shark inside the bowsprit and a large wobbegong shark under the scoured out section . The site can have very good visibility but a strong current makes it hard to see the entire wreck in one dive .",

  "/wiki/Lighter_(barge)": "A lighter is a type of flat-bottomed barge used to transfer goods and passengers to and from moored ships . Lighters were traditionally unpowered and were moved and steered using long oars called sweeps and the motive power of water currents . They were operated by highly skilled workers called lightermen and were a characteristic sight in London 's docks until about the 1960s , when technological changes made this form of lightering largely redundant . Unpowered lighters continue to be moved by powered tugs , however , and lighters may also now themselves be powered . The term is also used in the Lighter Aboard Ship ( LASH ) system . The name itself is of uncertain origin , but is believed to possibly derive from an old Dutch or German word , lichten ( to lighten or unload ) . In Dutch , the word lichter is still used for smaller ships that take over goods from larger ships . The lighter barge gave rise to the lighter tug , a small , maneuverable type of harbour tug . Lighter tugs - or simply lighters - are designed for towing lighter barges . As such , they are smaller than traditional harbour tugs and lack the power or equipment to handle large ships . Lighters , albeit powered ones , were proposed to be used in 2007 at Port Lincoln and Whyalla in South Australia to load Capesize ships which are too big for the shallower waters close to shore . Hong Kong widely uses lighters in midstream operations where lighters transport cargo , mostly containers , between oceangoing vessels or to and from terminals .",

  "/wiki/Full_rigged_ship": "A full-rigged ship or fully rigged ship is a sailing vessel 's sail plan with three or more masts , all of them square-rigged . A full-rigged ship is said to have a ship rig or be ship-rigged . Sometimes such a vessel will merely be called a ship in 18th- to early-19th-century and earlier usage , to distinguish it from other large three-masted blue-water working vessels such as barques , barquentines , fluyts etc . This full or ship-rig sail plan thus is a term of art [ clarification needed ] that differentiates such vessels as well from other working or cargo vessels with widely diverse alternative sail-plans such as galleons , cogs , sloops , caravels , schooners , brigs and carracks ; some of which also have three masted variants ( brigs , schooners , sloops , and galleons ) . The ship-rig sail plan also differs drastically from the large panoply of one and two masted vessels found as working and recreational sailboats . Alternatively , a full-rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead , as in collier or frigate , rather than being called a ship . In many languages the word frigate or frigate rig refers to a full-rigged ship .",

  "/wiki/AHS_Centaur": "Australian Hospital Ship ( AHS ) Centaur [ a ] was a hospital ship which was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine off the coast of Queensland , Australia , on 14 May 1943 . Of the 332 medical personnel and civilian crew aboard , 268 died , including 63 of the 65 army personnel . The Scottish-built vessel was launched in 1924 as a combination passenger liner and refrigerated cargo ship and operated a trade route between Western Australia and Singapore via the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , carrying passengers , cargo , and livestock . At the start of World War II , Centaur ( like all British Merchant Navy vessels ) was placed under British Admiralty control , but after being fitted with defensive equipment , was allowed to continue normal operations . In November 1941 , the ship rescued German survivors of the engagement between Kormoran and HMAS Sydney . Centaur was relocated to Australia 's east coast in October 1942 , and used to transport materiel to New Guinea . In January 1943 , Centaur was handed over to the Australian military for conversion into a hospital ship , as the ship 's small size made her suitable for operating in Maritime Southeast Asia . The refit ( including installation of medical facilities and repainting with Red Cross markings ) was completed in March , and the ship undertook a trial voyage : transporting wounded from Townsville to Brisbane , then from Port Moresby to Brisbane . After replenishing in Sydney , Centaur embarked the 2/12th Field Ambulance for transport to New Guinea , and sailed on 12 May . Before dawn on 14 May 1943 , during her second voyage , Centaur was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine off North Stradbroke Island , Queensland . The majority of the 332 aboard died in the attack ; the 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later .

  "/wiki/Steamship": "A steamship , often referred to as a steamer , is a type of steam-powered vessel , typically ocean-faring and seaworthy , that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move ( turn ) propellers or paddlewheels . The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s ; however , there were exceptions that came before . Steamships usually use the prefix designations of PS for paddle steamer or SS for screw steamer ( using a propeller or screw ) . As paddle steamers became less common , SS is assumed by many to stand for steamship . Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as MV for motor vessel , so it is not correct to use SS for most modern vessels . As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns , new trade routes opened up . The steamship has been described as a major driver of the first wave of trade globalization ( 1870-1913 ) and contributor to an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history .",

One of the strongest storms ever to affect the Townsville area , Althea was the fourth system and second severe tropical cyclone of the 1971-72 Australian region cyclone season . After forming near the Solomon Islands on 19 December and heading southwest across the Coral Sea , the storm reached its peak intensity with 10-minute average maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h ( 105 mph ) - Category 4 on the Australian cyclone scale . At 09:00 AEST on Christmas Eve , Althea struck the coast of Queensland near Rollingstone , about 50 km ( 30 mi ) north of Townsville . Although early weather satellites provided only occasional glimpses into the cyclone 's formative stages , its landfall was monitored closely by land-based radar that depicted an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle . Althea produced copious rainfall over central and western Queensland as it turned toward the southeast , and on 26 December the cyclone emerged over open waters . After briefly re-intensifying , the system dissipated on 29 December . While moving ashore , Althea generated wind gusts as high as 215 km/h ( 134 mph ) that wrought significant destruction around Townsville and left nearby Magnetic Island in a state of ruin ; almost all of the buildings on the island were damaged to some degree . A significant 3.66 m ( 12.0 ft ) storm surge battered the mainland , while high waves destroyed roads and seawalls . Beaches receded by up to 15.8 m ( 52 ft ) due to coastal erosion .

  "/wiki/Ocean_liner": "An ocean liner is a passenger ship primarily used as a form of transportation across seas or oceans . Liners may also carry cargo or mail , and may sometimes be used for other purposes ( such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships ) . Cargo vessels running to a schedule are sometimes called liners . The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading , nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself , and not transportation , is the prime purpose of the trip . Nor does it include tramp steamers , even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers . Some shipping companies refer to themselves as lines and their container ships , which often operate over set routes according to established schedules , as liners . Ocean liners are usually strongly built with a high freeboard to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean . Additionally , they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships , and have large capacities for fuel , food and other consumables on long voyages . The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century . Technological innovations such as the steam engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built , giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time , especially between the United Kingdom and Germany . Once the dominant form of travel between continents , ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II .

  "/wiki/Cutter_(boat)": "A cutter is generally a small to medium-sized vessel , depending on its role and definition . Historically , it was a smallish single- or double-masted , decked sailcraft designed for speed rather than capacity . As such , it was gaff-rigged , with two or more headsails and often a bowsprit of some length , with a mast sometimes set farther back than on a sloop . While historically a workboat , as used by harbor pilots , the military , and privateers , sailing cutters today are most commonly fore-and-aft rigged private yachts . Powered cutters vary in size depending on their function , with small boats for ferrying passengers between larger craft and shore sometimes referred to as cutters , rugged smallish vessels serving the traditional role of delivering harbor pilots , and large ocean-going U.S. Coast Guard or UK Border Force ships referred to as cutters by tradition . Open oared cutters were carried aboard 18th century naval vessels and rowed by pairs of men sitting side-by-side on benches . A similar form that evolved among London watermen remains in use today in club racing .",
