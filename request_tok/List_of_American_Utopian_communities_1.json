  "/wiki/Art_colony": "An art colony or artists ' colony is a place where creative practitioners live and interact with one another . Artists are often invited or selected through a formal process , for a residency from a few weeks to over a year . Beginning with the early 20th century models , such as MacDowell Colony and Yaddo , hundreds of modern-day artist colonies now offer the benefit of time , space , and collaborative time away from the usual workaday world . Worldwide , the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are Res Artis , based in Amsterdam , and the Alliance of Artists Communities , based in Providence , Rhode Island . The Intra Asia Network , based in Taiwan , is a less formal body working to advance creative communities and exchanges throughout Asia . These consortia comprise most of the world 's active artists ' colonies . The art movement itself has only started to be investigated by scholars , with the chief historical studies consisting of Michael Jacobs 's introductory The Good and Simple Life and Nina L\u00fcbbren 's Artists Colonies in Europe 1870-1910 .",
  "/wiki/Georgism": "Georgism , also called geoism and single tax ( archaic ) , is an economic ideology holding that while people should own the value they produce themselves , economic value derived from land ( often including natural resources and natural opportunities ) should belong equally to all members of society . Developed from the writings of the economist and social reformer Henry George , the Georgist paradigm seeks solutions to social and ecological problems , based on principles of land rights and public finance which attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice . Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by natural monopolies , pollution and the control of commons , including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived privileges ( e.g . intellectual property ) . Any natural resource which is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent , but the classical and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations . Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient , fair and equitable . The main Georgist policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value . Georgists argue that revenues from a land value tax ( LVT ) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing taxes ( for example , on income , trade , or purchases ) that are unfair and inefficient . Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen 's dividend . Economists since Adam Smith and David Ricardo have observed that a public levy on land value does not cause economic inefficiency , unlike other taxes . A land value tax also has progressive tax effects . Advocates of land value taxes argue that they would reduce economic inequality , increase economic efficiency , remove incentives to underutilize urban land and reduce property speculation .",

  "/wiki/Socialist": "Socialism is a political , social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers ' self-management of enterprise , including the political theories and movements associated with such systems . Social ownership can be public , collective or cooperative ownership , or citizen ownership of equity . There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them , with social ownership being the common element shared by its various forms . Socialist systems are divided into non-market and market forms . Non-market socialism involves replacing factor markets and money with engineering and technical criteria based on calculation performed in-kind , thereby producing an economic mechanism that functions according to different economic laws from those of capitalism . Non-market socialism aims to circumvent the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system . The socialist calculation debate , originated by the economic calculation problem , concerns the feasibility and methods of resource allocation for a planned socialist system . By contrast , market socialism retains the use of monetary prices , factor markets and in some cases the profit motive , with respect to the operation of socially owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them . Profits generated by these firms would be controlled directly by the workforce of each firm , or accrue to society at large in the form of a social dividend . Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation ; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics ; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them ; and present in both industrialised and developing nations . Social democracy originated within the socialist movement , supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice . While having socialism as a long-term goal , it has come to embrace a Keynesian mixed economy within a predominantly , developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that includes substantial state intervention in the form of income redistribution , regulation and a welfare state .",

  "/wiki/Census-designated_place": "A census-designated place ( CDP ) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only . CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places , such as self-governing cities , towns , and villages , for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data . CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated community , for which the CDP is named , plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and , occasionally , other , smaller unincorporated communities as well . CDPs include small rural communities , colonias located along the Mexico-United States border , and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs . The boundaries of a CDP have no legal status and may not always correspond with the local understanding of the area or community with the same name . However , criteria established for the 2010 Census require that a CDP name be one that is recognized and used in daily communication by the residents of the community ( not a name developed solely for planning or other purposes ) and recommend that a CDP 's boundaries be mapped based on the geographic extent associated with inhabitants ' regular use of the named place . The Census Bureau states that census-designated places are not considered incorporated places and that it includes only census-designated places in its city population list for Hawaii because that state has no incorporated cities . In addition , census city lists from 2007 included Arlington County , Virginia 's CDP in the list with the incorporated places , but since 2010 , only the Urban Honolulu CDP , Hawaii representing the historic core of Honolulu , Hawaii , is shown in the city and town estimates .",

The colony was devised by lawyer and socialist politician Job Harriman after he had failed his bid to become the mayor of Los Angeles in 1911 . The colony 's land was acquired in 1913 and it was formally launched on May 1 , 1914 . The Llano del Rio Colony settled in the southern edge of the Mojave Desert along Highway 138 near what is now 165th Street East , in the alluvial plain that spread out to the north from the San Gabriel Mountains . The colony took advantage of water from Big Rock Creek , an intermittent stream that flowed from the San Gabriel Mountains . Several structures were constructed using local granite boulders and lumber , including a hotel , meeting house , and water storage tank . There was also a small open aqueduct made of granite cobbles and cement . The remnants of the built features are still visible at the site . During 1918 , the colony was abandoned . Llano del Rio turned out to be too far from other settlements to develop a sustaining economy , and the water supply from Big Rock Creek proved to be unreliable . Some of the settlers , approximately 60 families in all , relocated to form New Llano , Louisiana .",
