  "/wiki/Sun_Microsystems": "Sun Microsystems , Inc. ( Sun for short ) was an American company that sold computers , computer components , software , and information technology services and created the Java programming language , the Solaris operating system , ZFS , the Network File System ( NFS ) , and SPARC . Sun contributed significantly to the evolution of several key computing technologies , among them Unix , RISC processors , thin client computing , and virtualized computing . Sun was founded on February 24 , 1982 . At its height , the Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara , California ( part of Silicon Valley ) , on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center . On April 20 , 2009 , it was announced that Oracle Corporation would acquire Sun for US $ 7.4 billion . The deal was completed on January 27 , 2010 . Sun products included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture , as well as on x86-based AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors . Sun also developed its own storage systems and a suite of software products , including the Solaris operating system , developer tools , Web infrastructure software , and identity management applications . technologies included the Java platform and NFS . In general , Sun was a proponent of open systems , particularly Unix . It was also a major contributor to open-source software , as evidenced by its $ 1 billion purchase , in 2008 , of MySQL , an open-source relational database management system . At various times , Sun had manufacturing facilities in several locations worldwide , including Newark , California ; Hillsboro , Oregon ; and Linlithgow , Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation": "The Apache Software Foundation /\u0259\u02c8p\u00e6t\u0283i/ ( ASF ) is an American non-profit corporation ( classified as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization in the United States ) to support Apache software projects , including the Apache HTTP Server . The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated on March 25 , 1999 . The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers . The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is free and open-source software ( FOSS ) . The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative , consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license . Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project . The ASF is a meritocracy , implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects . The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization , in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in . Among the ASF 's objectives are : to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects ; to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission . The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year , highlighting Apache projects and related technology .",

  "/wiki/BSD_License": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses , imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software . This is in contrast to copyleft licenses , which have share-alike requirements . The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",

  "/wiki/Eclipse_Public_License": "The Eclipse Public License ( EPL ) is an open source software license most notably used for the Eclipse IDE and other projects by the Eclipse Foundation . It replaces the Common Public License ( CPL ) and removes certain terms relating to litigations related to patents . The Eclipse Public License is designed to be a business-friendly free software license , and features weaker copyleft provisions than licenses such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . The receiver of EPL-licensed programs can use , modify , copy and distribute the work and modified versions , in some cases being obligated to release their own changes . The EPL is approved by the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) and is listed as a free software license by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . Discussion of a new version of the EPL began in May 2013 . Version 2.0 was announced on 24 August 2017 .",
  "/wiki/LGPL": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",
  "/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License": "The Affero General Public License ( Affero GPL and informally Affero License ) is a free software license . The first version of the Affero General Public License ( AGPLv1 ) , was published by Affero , Inc. in March 2002 , and based on the GNU General Public License , version 2 ( GPLv2 ) . The second version ( AGPLv2 ) was published in November 2007 , as a transitional license to allow an upgrade path from AGPLv1 to the GNU Affero General Public License ( a variant of the original Affero GPL license that is compatible with GPLv3 ) . Both versions of the Affero GPL were designed to close a perceived application service provider ( ASP ) loophole in the ordinary GPL , where , by using but not distributing the software , the copyleft provisions are not triggered . Each version differs from the version of the GNU GPL on which it is based in having an added provision addressing use of software over a computer network . This provision requires that the full source code be made available to any network user of the AGPL-licensed work , typically a web application .",
  "/wiki/GPL": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",
