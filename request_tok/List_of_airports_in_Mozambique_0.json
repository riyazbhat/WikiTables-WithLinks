  "/wiki/Angoche": "Angoche is a city of Nampula Province in Mozambique . The city was named Ant\u00f3nio Enes until 1976 , after the 19th-century Portuguese journalist and colonial administrator , Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Enes . In administrative terms , since 1998 , the city is also a municipality . Angoche is an old Muslim trading centre , which local tradition states was founded in the 1490s by refugees from the Kilwa Sultanate . Xosa , the son of one of the leaders of the refugees , was made the first sultan . One of the earliest settlements in Mozambique and an important gold and ivory trading post , it posed a serious rival to the Portuguese settlement in Mozambigue until the mid-16th century , when Angoche was eclipsed by Quelimane as an entry port to the interior . However , Angoche continued to play a role in coastal trade and was an important economic and political centre in the region , with close ties to Ilha de Mo\u00e7ambique . In the 19th century , Angoche became the focus of the clandestine slave trade , which continued until the 1860s when the town was attacked by the Portuguese . While effective Portuguese administration was not established until several decades later , the attack marked the beginning of Angoche 's downfall , and the town never regained its former status . Today , Angoche is a quiet , somewhat dilapidated district capital with few reminders of its past . Several islands lie offshore from the town . The major language of Angoche and nearby Koti Island is Ekoti , a Makhuwa language borrowing from 15th century Swahili .",

  "/wiki/Bazaruto_Island": "Bazaruto ( Portuguese : Ilha do Bazaruto , from Ushurutswa , island of the mist ) is a sandy island located approximately 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) southeast of the mouth of the Save River , Mozambique ( 21\u00b038\u2032S 35\u00b030\u2032E / 21.633\u00b0S 35.500\u00b0E / -21.633 ; 35.500Coordinates : 21\u00b038\u2032S 35\u00b030\u2032E / 21.633\u00b0S 35.500\u00b0E / -21.633 ; 35.500 ) . It is the largest island in the Bazaruto Archipelago and in the Bazaruto National Park . The warm , southward-flowing Mozambique Current seems to contribute to the increasing buildup of the sandy coastline . Because the water along this coastal area is very clear , much of the sub-surface channel pattern around the island is discernible . Several narrow lines of plankton bloom parallel the shoreline on the satellite photo below . Bazaruto Archipelago holds the largest population of dugong in Mozambique ( around 300 animals ) and almost certainly is the last remaining viable population of dugongs left off East Africa . The coastal plains show numerous lakes and a swampy environment that appears to be karst topography . Underlying the area is limestone rock that has eroded into a pockmarked landscape , creating water-filled sinkholes . Rainfall in this humid tropical climate amounts to around 850 mm ( 33 inches ) annually , largely concentrated in the months December to March . The closest mainland town to the island of Bazaruto is Inhassoro , although administratively it belongs to the Vilankulo District and Inhambane Province .",
