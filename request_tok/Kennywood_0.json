  "/wiki/Jack_Rabbit_(Kennywood)": "Jack Rabbit is a wooden roller coaster located at Kennywood Park near Pittsburgh in West Mifflin , Pennsylvania . Designed and built by John A. Miller and Harry C. Baker , Jack Rabbit opened in 1920 , making it is one of the oldest roller coasters in the world still in operation , and it 's tied with Jack Rabbit at Seabreeze Amusement Park for being the oldest in the United States . The ride 's three trains were manufactured by Edward Vettel , Sr. in 1951 and contain three cars of six seats each . The aging cars are considered a part of the ride 's nostalgic experience but also lead to some young children being disallowed to enter the ride ( 42 is the minimum ) , due to the use of a small lap bar to hold in riders . A popular early feature of the ride was a tunnel which covered the turnaround section after the first drop , but this was removed in 1947 when the new cars were ordered . In 1991 , the tunnel was restored , at a slightly shorter length . The Jack Rabbit was built shortly after Miller patented a new track design in 1920 ( which all wooden coasters built since have used ) . This design involved the use of wheels both under and over the track , which allowed Miller to create the then enormous 70-foot ( 21 m ) drop that is the attraction 's largest . It is most well known for its double dip element following the lift hill . The double dip produces strong airtime that makes the rider feel that they will be thrown from the seat , and a feeling that the train leaves the track ( it rises up but the upstop wheels keep it firmly on the rails ) . According to Rick Sebak , producer of Pittsburgh history programs for WQED , the layout and train design results in the rear seat of each train experiencing the greatest amount of airtime",

  "/wiki/Exterminator_(roller_coaster)": "The Exterminator is a steel roller coaster located at Kennywood amusement park in West Mifflin , Pennsylvania , near Pittsburgh . The ride was developed by Reverchon Industries . The ride is heavily themed around the concept of the rider as a rat attempting to escape from Kennywood exterminators . The concept is a pun of the phrase Wild Mouse roller coaster , which describes this type of coaster , characterized by small cars ( 4 people/car for Exterminator ) and sharp turns . Much of the theming takes place in the line for the ride , which includes such elaborate media as fake news broadcasts , and is usually the park 's longest , being usually or beyond a 40-minute wait . The ride is very dark and unique , as the introduction says unlike any ride you 've rode before . The tracks are fast , rough , include a few sudden falls , and end with a fast finale that includes flashing lights , and the car seemingly spinning out of control . Like other spinning wild mouse coasters , the cars face forwards for the first half of the ride , but are free to spin during the second half",

  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides , especially roller coasters . Based in Clearfield , Utah , the company was the successor to Arrow Development ( 1946-1981 ) and Arrow Huss ( 1981-1986 ) , which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries . Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s . Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company , Fabriweld , primarily to build track , by 1988 . Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3 , 2001 . S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved .

They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL , and they are the oldest franchise in the AFC . In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL , where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship , the Steelers of the post-merger ( modern ) era are among the most successful NFL franchises . The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six , and they have both played in ( 16 times ) and hosted ( 11 times ) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL . The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots ' record 11 AFC championships . The team is tied with the Broncos and Dallas Cowboys for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight . They lost their most recent championship appearance , Super Bowl XLV , on February 6 , 2011 . The Steelers , whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8 , 1933 . The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name , as was common practice for NFL teams at the time .
