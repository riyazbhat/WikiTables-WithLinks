  "/wiki/Homo_sapiens": "Homo sapiens is the only extant human species . The name is Latin for 'wise man ' and was introduced in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus ( who is himself the lectotype for the species ) . Extinct species of the genus Homo include Homo erectus , extant from roughly 1.9 to 0.4 million years ago , and a number of other species ( by some authors considered subspecies of either H. sapiens or H. erectus ) . The divergence of the lineage leading to H. sapiens out of ancestral H. erectus ( or an intermediate species such as Homo antecessor ) is estimated to have occurred in Africa roughly 500,000 years ago . The earliest fossil evidence of early Homo sapiens appears in Africa around 300,000 years ago , with the earliest genetic splits among modern people , according to some evidence , dating to around the same time . [ note 1 ] Sustained archaic admixture is known to have taken place both in Africa and ( following the recent Out-Of-Africa expansion ) in Eurasia , between about 100,000 and 30,000 years ago . The term anatomically modern humans ( AMH ) is used to distinguish H. sapiens having an anatomy consistent with the range of phenotypes seen in contemporary humans from varieties of extinct archaic humans . This is useful especially for times and regions where anatomically modern and archaic humans co-existed , for example , in Paleolithic Europe . Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) .",
  "/wiki/Odobenus_rosmarus_divergens": "The walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ) is a large flippered marine mammal with a discontinuous distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere . The walrus is the only living species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus . This species is subdivided into two subspecies : the Atlantic walrus ( O. r. rosmarus ) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific walrus ( O. r. divergens ) which lives in the Pacific Ocean . Adult walrus are characterised by prominent tusks and whiskers , and their considerable bulk : adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than and , among pinnipeds , are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals . Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves , spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat . Walruses are relatively long-lived , social animals , and they are considered to be a keystone species in the Arctic marine regions . The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples , who have hunted the walrus for its meat , fat , skin , tusks , and bone . During the 19th century and the early 20th century , walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber , walrus ivory , and meat . The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region . Their population has rebounded somewhat since then , though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference .",
  "/wiki/Canis_lupus_familiaris": "The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species ) is a member of the genus Canis ( canines ) , which forms part of the wolf-like canids , and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore . The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated , which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct . The dog was the first species to be domesticated , and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species . Dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors . They perform many roles for humans , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship and , more recently , aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles . This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man 's best friend .",
  "/wiki/Equus_caballus": "The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus . It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior . Horses are adapted to run , allowing them to quickly escape predators , possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down , with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .",
  "/wiki/Mus_musculus": "The house mouse ( Mus musculus ) is a small mammal of the order Rodentia , characteristically having a pointed snout , large rounded ears , and a long and hairy tail . It is one of the most abundant species of the genus Mus . Although a wild animal , the house mouse has benefited significantly from associating with human habitation to the point that truly wild populations are significantly less common than the semi-tame populations near human activity . The house mouse has been domesticated as the pet or fancy mouse , and as the laboratory mouse , which is one of the most important model organisms in biology and medicine . The complete mouse reference genome was sequenced in 2002 .",

  "/wiki/Pelodiscus_sinensis": "The Chinese softshell turtle ( Pelodiscus sinensis ) is a species of softshell turtle that is endemic to China ( Inner Mongolia to Hainan ) , with records of escapees - some of which have established introduced populations - in a wide range of other Asian countries , as well as Spain , Brazil and Hawaii . Populations native to Northeast China , Russia , Korea and Japan were formerly included in this species , but are now regarded as separate as the northern Chinese softshell turtle ( P. maackii ) . Furthermore , localized populations in Guangxi and Hunan ( where the Chinese softshell turtle also is present ) , as well as Vietnam , are recognized as the lesser Chinese softshell turtle ( P. parviformis ) and Hunan softshell turtle ( P. axenaria ) . The Chinese softshell turtle is a vulnerable species , threatened by habitat loss and collection for food such as turtle soup . Millions are now farmed , especially in China , to support the food industry , and it is the world 's economically most important turtle .",
  "/wiki/Anas_platyrhynchos": "The mallard ( or ) ( Anas platyrhynchos ) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas , Eurasia , and North Africa and has been introduced to New Zealand , Australia , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Argentina , Chile , Colombia , the Falkland Islands , and South Africa . This duck belongs to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae . The male birds ( drakes ) have a glossy green head and are grey on their wings and belly , while the females ( hens or ducks ) have mainly brown-speckled plumage . Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings ; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers . The mallard is long , of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length . The wingspan is and the bill is long . It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks , weighing . Mallards live in wetlands , eat water plants and small animals , and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes . This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks . The female lays eight to 13 creamy white to greenish-buff spotless eggs , on alternate days . Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days . The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch .",
  "/wiki/Gallus_gallus": "The red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ) is a tropical bird in the family Phasianidae . They are the primary progenitor of the domestic chicken ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) ( though genetic evidence strongly suggests some past hybridisation with the grey junglefowl , as well ) . The red junglefowls were first domesticated at least 5,000 years ago in India . Since then , their domestic form has spread around the world and is kept globally as a very productive food source of both meat and eggs .",
  "/wiki/Xenopus_tropicalis": "The western clawed frog ( Xenopus tropicalis ) is a species of frog in the family Pipidae , also known as tropical clawed frog . It is the only species in the genus Xenopus to have a diploid genome . Its genome has been sequenced , making it a significant model organism for genetics that complements the related species Xenopus laevis ( the African clawed frog ) , a widely used vertebrate model for developmental biology . X. tropicalis also has a number of advantages over X. laevis in research , such as a much shorter generation time ( < 5 months ) , smaller size ( body length ) , and a larger number of eggs per spawn . It is found in Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Ivory Coast , Equatorial Guinea , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Liberia , Nigeria , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Togo , and possibly Mali . Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests , moist savanna , rivers , intermittent rivers , swamps , freshwater lakes , intermittent freshwater lakes , freshwater marshes , intermittent freshwater marshes , rural gardens , heavily degraded former forests , water storage areas , ponds , aquaculture ponds , and canals and ditches .",

Native to South Asia , it is a popular aquarium fish , frequently sold under the trade name zebra danio ( and thus often called a tropical fish although both tropical and subtropical ) . The zebrafish is an important and widely used vertebrate model organism in scientific research , for example in drug development , in particular pre-clinical development . It is also notable for its regenerative abilities , and has been modified by researchers to produce many transgenic strains . ( ph ) ( nitrite ) ( nitrate ) /2019",
  "/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster": "Drosophila melanogaster is a species of fly ( the taxonomic order Diptera ) in the family Drosophilidae . The species is known generally as the common fruit fly or vinegar fly . Starting with Charles W. Woodworth 's proposal of the use of this species as a model organism , D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics , physiology , microbial pathogenesis , and life history evolution . As of 2017 , eight Nobel prizes had been awarded for research using Drosophila . D. melanogaster is typically used in research because it can be readily reared in the laboratory , has only four pairs of chromosomes , breeds quickly , and lays many eggs . Its geographic range includes all continents , including islands . D. melanogaster is a common pest in homes , restaurants , and other places where food is served . Flies belonging to the family Tephritidae are also called fruit flies . This can cause confusion , especially in the Mediterranean , Australia , and South Africa , where the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata is an economic pest .",
  "/wiki/Apis_mellifera": "The western honey bee or European honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) is the most common of the 7-12 species of honey bees worldwide . The genus name Apis is Latin for bee , and mellifera is the Latin for honey-bearing , referring to the species ' production of honey . Like all honey bee species , the western honey bee is eusocial , creating colonies with a single fertile female ( or queen ) , many normally non-reproductive females or workers , and a small proportion of fertile males or drones . Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees . Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals , through both pheromones and the dance language . The western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects , and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities . With human assistance , the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica . Because of its wide cultivation , this species is the single most important pollinator for agriculture globally . Western honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases , especially the Varroa mite and colony collapse disorder . As of 2019 , the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List , as numerous studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe ; however , it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies . Further research is required to enable differentiation between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild . Western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies , particularly in the fields of social evolution , learning , and memory ; they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity , to assess non-target impacts of commercial pesticides .",
