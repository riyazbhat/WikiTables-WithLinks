  "/wiki/Reality_Television": "Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents purportedly unscripted real-life situations , often starring unknown individuals rather than professional actors . Reality television came to prominence in the late 1990s and the early 2000s with the global successes of the series Survivor , Idols , and Big Brother , all of which became global franchises . Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with confessionals , short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen . Competition-based reality shows typically feature gradual elimination of participants , either by a panel of judges or by the viewership of the show . Documentaries , television news , sports television , talk shows , and traditional game shows are generally not classified as reality television . Some genres of television programming that predate the reality television boom have been retroactively classified as reality television , including hidden camera shows , talent-search shows , documentary series about ordinary people , high-concept game shows , home improvement shows , and court shows featuring real-life cases . Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity . Critics argue that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality , in ways both implicit ( participants being placed in artificial situations ) , and deceptive ( misleading editing , participants being coached on behavior , storylines generated ahead of time , scenes being staged ) . Some shows have been accused of rigging the favorite or underdog to win . Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants ; that they make stars out of untalented people unworthy of fame , infamous figures , or both ; and that they glamorize vulgarity",

  "/wiki/Comedian": "A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh . This might be through jokes or amusing situations , or acting foolish ( as in slapstick ) or employing prop comedy . A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian . A popular saying , variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn , is , A comic says funny things ; a comedian says things funny , which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona . Since the 1980s , a new wave of comedy , called alternative comedy , has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style . This normally involves more experiential , or observational reporting , e.g . Alexei Sayle , Daniel Tosh and Malcolm Hardee . As far as content is concerned , comedians such as Tommy Tiernan , Des Bishop , Kevin Hart and Joan Rivers draw on their background to poke fun at themselves , while others such as Jon Stewart , and Ben Elton have very strong political and cultural undertones . Many comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal , the Edinburgh Fringe , and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia . Often a comic 's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award , such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award ( formerly the Perrier comedy award ) . Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment , such as film and television , where they become more widely known ; e.g. , Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais . However , a comic 's stand-up success does not guarantee a film 's critical or box office success",

  "/wiki/Rapper": "Rapping ( or rhyming , spitting , emceeing , MCing ) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates rhyme , rhythmic speech , and street vernacular , which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways , usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment . The components of rap include content ( what is being said ) , flow ( rhythm , rhyme ) , and delivery ( cadence , tone ) . Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed in time to musical accompaniment . Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music , it is commonly associated with that genre in particular ; however , the origins of rap precede hip-hop culture . The earliest precursor to modern rap is the West African griot tradition , in which oral historians , or praise-singers , would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies , or use their rhetorical techniques for gossip or to praise or critique individuals . Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of black verbal reverence [ definition needed ] , through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs , to Muhammad Ali 's verbal taunts and the poems of The Last Poets . [ vague ] Therefore , rap lyrics and music are part of the Black rhetorical continuum , and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies . The person credited with originating the style of delivering rhymes over extensive music , that would become known as rap , was Anthony DJ Hollywood Holloway from Harlem , New York . Rap is usually delivered over a beat , typically provided by a DJ , turntablist , beatboxer , or performed a cappella without accompaniment . Stylistically , rap occupies a gray area between speech , prose , poetry , and singing . The word , which predates the musical form , originally meant to lightly strike , and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee . The word had been used in British English since the 16th century",

  "/wiki/Entrepreneur": "Entrepreneurship is the process of designing , launching and running a new business , which is often initially a small business . The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs . Entrepreneurship has been described as the capacity and willingness to develop , organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit . While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses , due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up , a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to lack of funding , bad business decisions , an economic crisis , lack of market demand , or a combination of all of these . A broader definition of the term is sometimes used , especially in the field of economics . In this usage , an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technologies into products and services : The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital , talent , and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation . In this sense , the term Entrepreneurship also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms , in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses . Coming up with an idea for a product or service is not the hardest thing for startups and entrepreneurs . Building a product isnt even the hardest .

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States .
