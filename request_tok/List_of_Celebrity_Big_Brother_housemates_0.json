The two or more people with the most votes were nominated to leave the House . The viewers then decided which of the nominees should leave , with the selected person leaving during a live show .

After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974 , he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush . Stallone mostly only found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizeable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor , starting in 1976 with his self-created role as the boxer Rocky Balboa , in the first film of the successful Rocky series ( 1976-2018 ) . In the films , Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents , and wins the world heavyweight championship twice . The last two entries in the series are Creed and Creed 2 , that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis Creed , the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed , to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor . Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise , and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed , as well as a third Oscar nomination , having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior . Stallone had similar box-office success , portraying the PTSD plagued soldier John Rambo in the five Rambo films ( 1982-2019 ) and as mercenary Barney Ross in the three The Expendables films ( 2010-2014 ) . He wrote or co-wrote most of the films in his three biggest franchises , and directed many of them . Stallone 's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry , and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum . His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps , and Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum . It was announced on December 7 , 2010 that he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the non-participant category . In 1977 , Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for Rocky , for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor"
