  "/wiki/Buster_Keaton": "Joseph Frank Keaton ( October 4 , 1895 - February 1 , 1966 ) , known professionally as Buster Keaton , was an American actor , comedian , film director , producer , screenwriter , and stunt performer . He is best known for his silent films , in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic , deadpan expression that earned him the nickname The Great Stone Face . Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton 's extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929 when he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies . His career declined afterward with a loss of artistic independence when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , his wife divorced him , and he descended into alcoholism . He recovered in the 1940s , remarried , and revived his career as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life , earning an Honorary Academy Award in 1959 . Many of Keaton 's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded , such as Sherlock Jr. ( 1924 ) , The General ( 1926 ) , and The Cameraman ( 1928 ) , with The General widely viewed as his masterpiece . Among its strongest admirers was Orson Welles , who stated that The General was cinema 's highest achievement in comedy , and perhaps the greatest film ever made . Keaton in 1996 was recognized as the seventh-greatest film director by Entertainment Weekly , and the American Film Institute ranked him in 1999 as the 21st greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema .",

  "/wiki/Our_Gang": "Our Gang ( known subsequently to television syndication as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach 's Rascals ) is an American series of comedy short films chronicling a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures . Created by comedy producer and studio executive Hal Roach , the series was produced in various forms from 1922 to 1944 and is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way . Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected , raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles . The series broke new ground by portraying white and black children interacting as equals . The franchise began in 1922 as a series of silent short subjects produced by the Roach studio and released by Path\u00e9 Exchange . Roach changed distributors from Path\u00e9 to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) in 1927 , and the series entered its most popular period after converting to sound in 1929 . Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938 , when the series was sold to MGM , which produced the comedies until 1944 . Across 220 short films and a feature-film spin-off , General Spanky , the Our Gang series featured over 41 child actors as regular members of cast . As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights , the 80 Roach-produced talkies were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955 . Roach 's The Little Rascals package ( now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM 's Our Gang package ( now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Television ) have since remained in syndication . New productions based on the shorts have been made over the years , including a 1994 feature film , The Little Rascals , released by Universal Pictures .",

  "/wiki/The_Loneliness_of_the_Long_Distance_Runner_(film)": "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner is a 1962 British coming-of-age film . The screenplay adaptation was written by Alan Sillitoe from Sillitoe 's short story of the same name . The film was directed by Tony Richardson , one of the new young directors emerging from the English Stage Company at the Royal Court . It tells the story of a rebellious youth ( played by Tom Courtenay ) , sentenced to a borstal ( Borstal ) for burgling a bakery , who gains privileges in the institution through his prowess as a long-distance runner . During his solitary runs , reveries of important events before his incarceration lead him to re-evaluate his status as the prize athlete of the Governor ( Michael Redgrave ) , eventually undertaking a rebellious act of personal autonomy and suffering an immediate loss of privileges . The film poster 's byline is you can play it by rules . or you can play it by ear - WHAT COUNTS is that you play it right for you . The notion is echoed by other contemporary films , such as a rapid series of three contemporary Lone Ranger films . The film depicts Britain in the late 1950s to early 1960s as an elitist place , bleak for working- to middle-class people . Sillitoe was one of the angry young men producing media vaunting or depicting the plight of rebellious youths . The film has characters entrenched in their social context . Class consciousness abounds throughout : the them and us notions that Richardson stresses reflect the basis of British society at the time , so that Redgrave 's proper gentleman of a Governor is in contrast to many of the young working class inmates .",
