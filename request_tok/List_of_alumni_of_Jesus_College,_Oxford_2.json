As a soldier , Xenophon became commander of the Ten Thousand at about 30 , with noted military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge saying of him , the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior . He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use flanking maneuvers , feints and attacks in depth . He was among the greatest commanders of antiquity . As a historian , Xenophon is known for recording the history of his time , the late-5th and early-4th centuries BC , in such works as the Hellenica , which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War ( 431-404 BC ) , thus representing a thematic continuation of Thucydides ' History of the Peloponnesian War . As one of the Ten Thousand ( Greek mercenaries ) , Xenophon participated in Cyrus the Younger 's failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II of Persia . He recounted the events in Anabasis , his most notable history . Like Plato , Xenophon is an authority on Socrates , about whom he wrote several books of dialogues ( the Memorabilia ) and an Apology of Socrates to the Jury , which recounts the philosopher 's trial in 399 BC . Despite being born an Athenian citizen , Xenophon was also associated with Sparta , the traditional enemy of Athens . His pro-oligarchic politics , military service under Spartan generals in the Persian campaign and elsewhere , and his friendship with King Agesilaus II endeared Xenophon to the Spartans . Some of his works have a pro-Spartan bias , especially the royal biography Agesilaus and the Constitution of the Spartans . Xenophon 's works span several genres and are written in plain-language Attic Greek , for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the Ancient Greek language",

The lengthiest and most famous of Xenophon 's Socratic writings , the Memorabilia is essentially an apologia ( defense ) of Socrates , differing from both Xenophon 's Apology of Socrates to the Jury and Plato 's Apology mainly in that the Apologies present Socrates as defending himself before the jury , whereas the former presents Xenophon 's own defense of Socrates , offering edifying examples of Socrates ' conversations and activities along with occasional commentary from Xenophon",

The texts have great historical , religious , and linguistic significance because they include the second-oldest known surviving manuscripts of works later included in the Hebrew Bible canon , along with deuterocanonical and extra-biblical manuscripts which preserve evidence of the diversity of religious thought in late Second Temple Judaism .

However , a small number of well-preserved , almost intact manuscripts have survived - fewer than a dozen among those from the Qumran Caves .
