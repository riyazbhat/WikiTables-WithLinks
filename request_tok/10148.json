  "/wiki/1876_Major_League_Baseball_season": "After a tumultuous five-year existence , the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players ( NA ) folded following the 1875 season . The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs ( NL ) was formed in Chicago , Illinois by businessman , and owner of the Chicago White Stockings ( now known as , the Chicago Cubs ) , William Hulbert , for the purpose of replacing the NA , which he believed to have been corrupt , mismanaged , full of rowdy , drunken ballplayers , and under the influence of the gambling community . One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more . The initial NL season began with eight teams , and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21 . The NL is considered to be the first major league , although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim .",
  "/wiki/Deacon_White": "James Laurie Deacon White ( December 2 , 1847 - July 7 , 1939 ) was an American baseball player who was one of the principal stars during the first two decades of the sport 's professional era . The outstanding catcher of the 1870s during baseball 's barehanded period , he caught more games than any other player during the decade , and was a major figure on five consecutive championship teams from 1873 to 1877 - three in the National Association ( NA ) , in which he played throughout its five-year existence from 1871 to 1875 , and two in the National League ( NL ) , which was formed as the first fully recognized major league in 1876 , partially as a result of White and three other stars moving from the powerhouse Boston Red Stockings to the Chicago White Stockings . Although he was already 28 when the NL was established , White played 15 seasons in the major leagues , completing a 23-year career at the top levels of the sport . In 1871 , White was the first batter to come to the plate in the National Association , the first professional baseball league . After compiling a .347 batting average over five NA seasons , he led the NL in runs batted in ( RBI ) in its first two seasons of play , and also led the league in batting ( .387 ) , slugging average , hits , triples and total bases in a brief shift to first base in 1877 . For three years afterward , he joined his younger brother Will , a successful pitcher , with the Cincinnati Reds and Cincinnati Stars . In his mid-30s he became an effective third baseman when the toil of catching had become too great , and was a major force on the championship Detroit Wolverines team of 1887 , batting .303 at age 39 . Over the 20-year period of his career , White batted .312 and had more RBI ( 988 ) than any player except Cap Anson . Upon his retirement , he was among baseball 's all-time leaders in career games , at bats , hits and total bases . He ranked fourth in career total chances at third base , fifth in assists , and sixth in putouts and double plays . White was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013 .",

  "/wiki/Paul_Hines": "Paul Aloysius Hines ( March 1 , 1855 - July 10 , 1935 ) was an American center fielder in professional baseball who played in the National Association and Major League Baseball from 1872 to 1891 . Born in Virginia , he is credited with winning baseball 's first triple crown in 1878 ; the accomplishment was not noted at the time , as runs batted in would not be counted until years later , home runs were rare and home run leadership obscure , and Abner Dalrymple was then erroneously recognized as the batting champion . There is some controversy over whether Hines was also the first player to turn an unassisted triple play , since it was an 8-8-4 Triple Play . Hines probably practiced with the original Washington Nationals or played on its junior team before joining the National Association with that club in 1872 . When the original Chicago White Stockings resumed play in 1874 , the teenage Hines played every game , usually in center field . He remained with the club four seasons , including the inaugural National League championship season of 1876 , and then played eight seasons for the Providence Grays from 1878 to 1885 , spanning that club 's entire major league association , during which the club won two pennants . After the Providence club folded in 1885 , he remained an everyday major league center fielder through two seasons for a new Washington Nationals club and one for the Indianapolis Hoosiers , shifting to first base for a second Indianapolis season in 1889 . He returned to center field with gradually declining playing time for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys , Boston Beaneaters and Washington Statesmen in 1890 and 1891 . His last year in the major leagues was 1891 , but he continued to play baseball in minor leagues . He finished his professional career splitting 1896 between the minor league teams Burlington , Iowa and Mobile , Alabama , at the age of 41 . During the first five NL seasons , from 1876 through 1880 , Hines had more base hits than any other player , and he retired third to Cap Anson and Jim O'Rourke with 1,884 career hits in the majors . He also remained among the top 10 major league career home run hitters as late as 1887 .",

Including his time in the National Association ( NA ) , he played a record 27 consecutive seasons . Anson was regarded as one of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the game . Anson spent most of his career with the Chicago Cubs franchise ( then known as the White Stockings and later the Colts ) , serving as the club 's manager , first baseman and , later in his tenure , minority owner . He led the team to six National League pennants in the 1880s . Anson was one of baseball 's first great hitters , and probably the first to tally over 3,000 career hits . His contemporary influence and prestige are regarded by historians as playing a major role in establishing the racial segregation in professional baseball that persisted until the late 1940s . On several occasions , Anson refused to take the field when the opposing roster included black players . Anson may have influenced the most noted vote in 19th-century professional baseball in favor of segregation : a July 14 , 1887 one by the high-minor International League to ban the signing of new contracts with black players . After retiring as a player and leaving the Colts , Anson briefly managed the New York Giants . He ran several enterprises in Chicago , including opening a billiards and bowling hall and running a semi-professional baseball team he dubbed Anson 's Colts . Anson also toured extensively on the vaudeville circuit , performing monologues and songs .",

  "/wiki/King_Kelly": "Michael Joseph King Kelly ( December 31 , 1857 - November 8 , 1894 ) , also commonly known as $ 10,000 Kelly , was an American outfielder , catcher , and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League , International Association , Players ' League , and the American Association . He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters . Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career - in 1887 for the Beaneaters , in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players ' League 's existence , and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly 's Killers - before his retirement in 1893 . He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run , the hook slide , and the catcher 's practice of backing up first base . In only the second vote since its creation in 1939 , the Old Timers Committee ( now the Veterans ' Committee ) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 . In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator , a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball - and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects - placed stress on the following : Kelly 's hook slide does sound special , and players probably tried to copy it . Also , he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base ( when the usually lone umpire was n't looking ) , at least according to the newspaper record . And , Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose . Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s . At the turn of the century , that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes . Kelly 's autobiography Play Ball was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888 , the first autobiography by a baseball player ; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. Jack Drohan . Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career , first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem Casey at the Bat , sometimes butchering it .",

The Phillies have won 11 division titles , including five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011 ; these are ranked sixth among all teams and fourth in the National League .

He played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball , primarily for the National League 's Cleveland Spiders . Born in Grafton , Ohio , McKean began his career in 1884 with the Youngstown , Ohio club in the minor league Iron & Oil Association . After two more seasons in the minors , he was signed by the Cleveland Blues of the American Association , and became the club 's starting shortstop in their first year as a major league team . He remained in that position for the franchise ( which was renamed the Spiders in 1889 ) for nearly its entire existence . Prior to the 1899 season , the Spiders transferred most of their best players to the St. Louis Perfectos , including McKean . This was legal at the time , as both teams were owned by the same ownership group led by the Robison brothers . However , he did not perform up to expectations and was let go in July . The following season , the Spiders folded , and such shenanigans were outlawed . After not playing professionally for two years , McKean returned to play in the minor leagues in 1902 as player-manager of the Rochester Bronchos . After several more years in the minors , he retired following the 1908 season . All told , McKean racked up a grand total of 2,084 hits and 1,124 RBI during his major league career .",
