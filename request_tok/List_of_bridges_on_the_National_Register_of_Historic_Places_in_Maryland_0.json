  "/wiki/Centering": "Centring , centre , centering , or center is a type of falsework : the temporary structure upon which the stones of an arch or vault are laid during construction . Until the keystone is inserted an arch has no strength and needs the centring to keep the voussoirs in their correct relative positions . A simple centring without a truss is called a common centring . A cross piece connecting centring frames is called a lag or bolst . Centring is normally made of wood timbers , a relatively straightforward structure in a simple arch or vault ; but with more complex shapes involving double curvature , such as a dome or the bottle-shaped flue in a Norman-period kitchen , clay or sand bound by a weak lime mortar would be used . Shaping could be done by eye , perhaps with the help of a template , then stones or bricks laid against it . On larger works like a 19th-century pottery kiln this was impractical . The structure would be built round a post acting as a datum , and each course of stonework would be set at a distance from the datum .
