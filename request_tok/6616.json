Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic hurricane belt . Its capital and largest city is Bridgetown . Inhabited by Kalinago people since the 13th century , and prior to that by other Amerindians , Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the Spanish Crown . It first appeared in a Spanish map in 1511 . The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536 , but later abandoned it in 1620 ; with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited , and to replenish their water supply . An English ship , the Olive Blossom , arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625 ; its men took possession of it in the name of King James I . In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English and later British colony .

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 .

Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations .

  "/wiki/Los_Altos,_Central_America": "Los Altos ( Spanish for the highlands or the heights ) was the sixth state of the Federal Republic of Central America , and a short-lived independent republic . Its capital was Quetzaltenango . Los Altos occupied eight departments in the west of present-day Guatemala as well as the Soconusco region in the Mexican state of Chiapas . The state originated from the political differences and tensions between Guatemala City on one side , and Quetzaltenango and other parts of western Central America on the other . Debate about separation from Guatemala dated from shortly after Central American independence from Spain in 1821 . Such a separate state was provided for by the Federal constitutional assembly of November 1824 , but there was sizable opposition to the separation in Guatemala City . The independence of Los Altos from Guatemala was officially proclaimed on 2 February 1838 . The Federal government recognized Los Altos as the sixth state of the union and seated the representatives of Los Altos in the Federal Congress on 5 June of that year . The flag of Los Altos was a modification of that of the Central American Union , with a central seal showing a volcano in the background with a quetzal ( a local bird symbolizing liberty ) in front . This was the first Central American flag to use the quetzal as a symbol ; since 1871 , it has been on the present flag of Guatemala . As the liberal Federation crumbled into civil war due to the influence of the Guatemalan conservatives and the regular clergy , who had been expelled from Central America after Francisco Moraz\u00e1n 's bloody invasion of Guatemala in 1829 , Los Altos declared itself an independent republic .",

  "/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland": "Newfoundland was a British dominion from 1907 to 1934 when it surrendered dominion status by ending self-government in exchange for British Royal Commission rule as a crown colony . Newfoundland remained a crown colony until Newfoundland joined Canada as a province . The dominion , situated in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast , comprised the island of Newfoundland as well as Labrador on the continental mainland . Before attaining dominion status , Newfoundland was a British colony , self-governing from 1855 . Newfoundland was one of the original dominions within the meaning of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster of 1931 , accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions at the time . In 1934 , Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status , ending 79 years of self-government . This episode came about due to a crisis in Newfoundland 's public finances in 1932 . Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island ( completed in the 1890s ) and by raising its own regiment for the First World War . In November 1932 the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt . The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position . The Commission 's report , published in October 1933 , recommended that Newfoundland give up its system of self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer the dominion through an appointed commission . The Newfoundland parliament accepted this recommendation and presented a petition to the King asking for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again .",
