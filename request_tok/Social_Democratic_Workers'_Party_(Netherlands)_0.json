  "/wiki/1918_Dutch_general_election": "General elections were held in the Netherlands on 3 July 1918 . They were the first elections held after a series of reforms that introduced universal male suffrage and pure proportional representation , replacing the previous system using first-past-the-post voting in single member constituencies . This change was known as the Great Pacification , which also included the introduction of state financing of religious schools , and led to the start of consociational democracy . The change in the electoral system led to major changes in the political make-up of the House of Representatives . The confessional right-wing parties , the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses , the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Christian Historical Union , together won 50 seats . Along with two Christian splinter-parties ( the Christian Democratic Party and the Christian Social Party ) they were able to gain a majority of 52 seats . The liberal parties lost the most seats . While in 1917 , two of the liberal parties , the Liberal Union and the League of Free Liberals , had won 31 seats , they were now reduced to 10 seats . Together with three smaller liberal parties , liberals now held only 15 seats in the House of representatives . The fragmentation of the House was caused by the low electoral threshold of just 0.5% , with the smallest party , the Alliance for the Democratisation of the Army , managing to win a seat with only 6,830 votes .",
  "/wiki/1922_Dutch_general_election": "General elections were held in the Netherlands on 5 July 1922 . They were the first elections held under universal suffrage , which became reality after the acceptance of a proposal by Henri Marchant in 1919 that gave women full voting rights . Almost all major parties had a woman elected . The number of female representatives increased from one to seven . Only the Anti-Revolutionary Party principally excluded women from the House of Representatives . Another amendment to the electoral law increased the electoral threshold from 0.5% to 0.75% , after six parties had won seats with less than 0.75% of the vote in the previous elections . The General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses remained the largest party , increasing from 30 to 32 seats , whilst the Anti-Revolutionary Party increased from 13 to 16 seats , and the Christian Historical Union went from 7 to 11 seats . The right-wing Christian Democratic Party and the Christian Social Party both lost their sole seats , disappearing from the House , while the Reformed Political Party ( SGP ) won a seat . The SGP , an orthodox Protestant party established in 1918 , was opposed to the co-operation of the Protestant ARP and CHU with the Catholics . The Social Democratic Workers ' Party lost two seats , whilst left-wing splinter parties also suffered losses , and went from four to two seats . Several liberal groups had merged in 1921 to form the Liberal State Party , but lost further seats as they were reduced from fifteen to only ten . However , a new Liberal Party led by the 85-year-old Samuel van Houten , won a seat .",
