The squadron was formed under the Australian Flying Corps in 1916 and saw action in the Sinai and Palestine Campaigns during World War I . It flew obsolete Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s , B.E.12s , Martinsyde G.100s and G.102s , as well as Airco DH.6s , Bristol Scouts and Nieuport 17s , before re-equipping with the R.E.8 in October 1917 and finally the Bristol Fighter in December . Its commanding officer in 1917-18 was Major Richard Williams , later known as the Father of the RAAF . Disbanded in 1919 , No . 1 Squadron was re-formed on paper as part of the RAAF in 1922 , and re-established as an operational unit three years later . During World War II , the squadron flew Lockheed Hudson bombers in the Malayan and Dutch East Indies campaigns , suffering severe losses before being reduced to cadre in 1942 .

  "/wiki/Airco_DH.5": "The Airco DH.5 was a British First World War single-seat biplane fighter aircraft . It was designed and manufactured at British aviation company Airco . Development was led by the aircraft designer Geoffrey de Havilland as a replacement for the obsolete Airco DH.2 . The DH.5 was one of the first British fighter designs to include the improved Constantinesco gun synchronizer , which allowed a forward-firing machine gun to fire through the propeller faster and more reliably than the older mechanical gears . It was also one of the earliest biplanes to feature a marked back-stagger of its wings . Despite these advances , by the time the DH.5 was fielded , it was already notedly inferior to other fighters that had entered into production and thus proved to be both unpopular and unsatisfactory amongst the pilots of the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) . As such , the type was quickly withdrawn from service as soon as supplies of the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 permitted .",

During World War I , the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions . It was disbanded in mid-1919 , following the end of hostilities . The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF , but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937 . It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and , equipped with English Electric Canberra jets , in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War .

Despite a disastrous start to its career , the definitive F.2B version proved to be an agile aircraft that was able to hold its own against opposing single-seat fighters ; its robust design ensured that it remained in military service into the 1930s . Some surplus aircraft were registered for civilian use , and dedicated civilian versions proved popular .",

  "/wiki/Royal_Aircraft_Factory_B.E.2": "The Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 was a British single-engine tractor two-seat biplane designed and developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory . Most production aircraft were constructed under contract by various private companies , both established aircraft manufacturers and firms that had not previously built aircraft . Around 3,500 were manufactured in all . Early versions of the B.E.2 entered squadron service with the Royal Flying Corps in 1912 ; the type continued to serve throughout the First World War . It was initially used as a front-line reconnaissance aircraft and light bomber ; modified as a single-seater it proved effective as a night fighter , destroying several German airships . By late 1915 , the B.E.2 was proving inadequate in defending itself against German fighters such as the then new Fokker Eindecker , leading to increased losses during the period known as the Fokker Scourge . Although by now obsolete , it had to remain in front-line service while suitable replacements were designed , tested and brought into service . Following its belated withdrawal from operations , the type served in various second line capacities , seeing use as a trainer and communications aircraft , as well as performing anti-submarine coastal patrol duties . The B.E.2 has always been a subject of controversy , both at the time and in later historical assessment . From the B.E.2c variant on it had been carefully adapted to be inherently stable , this feature was considered helpful in its artillery observation and aerial photography duties : most of which were assigned to the pilot , who was able to fly without constant attention to his flight controls . In spite of a tendency to swing on take off and a reputation for spinning , the type had a relatively low accident rate . The stability of the type was however achieved at the expense of heavy controls , making rapid manoeuvring difficult .",

Intended as a replacement for the vulnerable B.E.2 , the R.E.8 was widely regarded as more difficult to fly and gained a reputation in the Royal Flying Corps for being unsafe that was never entirely dispelled . Although eventually it gave reasonably satisfactory service , it was never an outstanding combat aircraft . Nonetheless , it remained the standard British reconnaissance and artillery observation aircraft from mid-1917 to the end of the war , serving alongside the rather more popular Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 . More than 4,000 R.E.8s were eventually produced ; these aircraft saw service in a range of different theatres , including Italy , Russia , Palestine and Mesopotamia , as well as the Western Front . The R.E.8 was rapidly withdrawn from service after the end of the conflict , by which time it was regarded as totally obsolete .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Aircraft_Factory_S.E.5": "The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 was a British biplane fighter aircraft of the First World War . It was developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory by a team consisting of Henry Folland , John Kenworthy and Major Frank Goodden . It was one of the fastest aircraft of the war , while being both stable and relatively manoeuvrable . According to aviation author Robert Jackson , the S.E.5 was : the nimble fighter that has since been described as the 'Spitfire of World War One ' . In most respects the S.E.5 had superior performance to the rival Sopwith Camel , although it was less immediately responsive to the controls . Problems with its Hispano-Suiza engine , particularly the geared-output H-S 8B-powered early versions , meant that there was a chronic shortage of the type until well into 1918 . Thus , while the first examples had reached the Western Front before the Camel , there were fewer squadrons equipped with the S.E.5 than with the Sopwith fighter . Together with the Camel , the S.E.5 was instrumental in regaining allied air superiority in mid-1917 and maintaining it for the rest of the war , ensuring there was no repetition of Bloody April 1917 when losses in the Royal Flying Corps were much heavier than in the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte . The S.E.5s remained in RAF service for some time following the Armistice that ended the conflict ; some were transferred to various overseas military operators , while a number were also adopted by civilian operators .",

  "/wiki/Sopwith_Camel": "The Sopwith Camel was a British First World War single-seat biplane fighter aircraft that was introduced on the Western Front in 1917 . It was developed by the Sopwith Aviation Company as a successor to the Sopwith Pup and became one of the best known fighter aircraft of the Great War . The Camel was powered by a single rotary engine and was armed with twin synchronized Vickers machine guns . Though proving difficult to handle , it provided for a high level of manoeuvrability to an experienced pilot , an attribute which was highly valued in the type 's principal use as a fighter aircraft . In total , Camel pilots have been credited with downing 1,294 enemy aircraft , more than any other Allied fighter of the conflict . Towards the end of the First World War , the type had also seen use as a ground-attack aircraft , partially due to it having become increasingly outclassed as the capabilities of fighter aircraft on both sides were rapidly advancing at that time . The main variant of the Camel was designated as the F.1 ; several dedicated variants were built for a variety of roles , including the 2F.1 Ship 's Camel , which was used for operating from the flight decks of aircraft carriers , the Comic night fighter variant , and the T.F.1 , a dedicated trench fighter that had been armoured for the purpose of conducting ground attacks upon heavily defended enemy lines . The Camel also saw use as a two-seat trainer aircraft . In January 1920 , the last aircraft of the type were withdrawn from RAF service ."
