  "/wiki/Trance_music": "Trance is a genre of electronic music that emerged from the British new-age music scene and the early 1990s German techno and hardcore scenes . At the same time trance music was developing in Europe , the genre was also gathering a following in the Indian state of Goa . Trance music is characterized by a tempo lying between 110-150 bpm ( BPM ) , repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 peaks or drops . Although trance is a genre of its own , it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno , house , pop , chill-out , classical music , tech house , ambient and film music . A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness . This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release . A common characteristic of trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely , leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again . Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs . Trance is mostly instrumental , although vocals can be mixed in : typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists , often without a traditional verse/chorus structure . Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre , which has been described as grand , soaring , and operatic and ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths . However , male singers , such as Jonathan Mendelsohn , are also featured .",

  "/wiki/Pop_music": "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern forms in the US and the UK during the mid-1950s . The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably , although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many diverse styles . Pop and rock were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s , when they became quite separated from each other . Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music , the genre is distinguished from chart music . Pop music often borrows elements from other styles such as urban , dance , rock , Latin , and country ; nevertheless , there are many key elements that define pop music . Identifying factors usually include short to medium-length songs written in a basic format , also known as perrypoetry ( often the verse-chorus structure ) , as well as common use of repeated choruses , melodic tunes and hooks .",
  "/wiki/Techno_music": "Techno is a genre of electronic dance music that is characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set . The central rhythm is often in common time ( 4/4 ) , while the tempo typically varies between 120 and 150 beats per minute ( bpm ) . Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines , sequencers , and synthesizers , as well as digital audio workstations . Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland 's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized , and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular . Detroit techno resulted from the melding of synth/techno-pop by artists such as Kraftwerk , Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra with African American styles such as house , electro , funk . Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society , with Alvin Toffler 's book The Third Wave a notable point of reference . Some producers view the style as an expression of technological spirituality . The music produced in the mid to late 1980s by Juan Atkins , Derrick May , and Kevin Saunderson ( collectively known as the Belleville Three ) , along with Eddie Fowlkes , Blake Baxter and James Pennington is viewed as the first wave of techno from Detroit . During the late 1980s in the UK the term techno was established as a name for the genre following the release of the 1988 compilation Techno ! The New Dance Sound of Detroit . Techno also became popular in other European countries , in particular Germany , but also Belgium and the Netherlands . In Europe during the early 1990s techno subgenres such as acid , hardcore , ambient , and dub techno developed .",
