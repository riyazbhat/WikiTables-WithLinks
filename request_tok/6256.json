  "/wiki/Course_(architecture)": "A course is a layer of the same unit running horizontally in a wall . It can also be defined as a continuous row of any masonry unit such as bricks , concrete masonry units ( CMU ) , stone , shingles , tiles , etc . Coursed masonry construction is that in which units are arranged in regular courses , and not irregularly . On the other hand , coursed rubble masonry construction is that in which units of random size , that are not cut down , are used to build courses and the in-between spaces are filled with mortar or smaller stones . If a course is the horizontal arrangement , then a wythe is the vertical section of a wall . A standard 8-inch CMU block is exactly equal to three courses of brick , so that is it easy to build a brick-on-CMU wall . A bond pattern ( or bonding pattern ) is the arrangement of several courses . The types of bond patterns can be found under Brickwork . When building a masonry wall the corners are first built and then the spaces between them are filled by the remaining courses .",
  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Coping_(architecture)": "Coping ( from cope , Latin capa ) consists of the capping or covering of a wall . A splayed or wedge coping slopes in a single direction ; a saddle coping slopes to either side of a central high point . A coping may consist of stone ( capstone ) , brick , clay or terracotta , concrete or cast stone , tile , slate , wood , thatch , or various metals , including aluminum , copper , stainless steel , steel , and zinc . In all cases it should be weathered ( have a slanted or curved top surface ) to throw off the water . Various types of copings exist . A diagrammatic explanation of copper copings is available . In Romanesque work copings appeared plain and flat , and projected over the wall with a throating to form a drip . In later work a steep slope was given to the weathering ( mainly on the outer side ) , and began at the top with an astragal ; in the Decorated Gothic style there were two or three sets off ; and in the later Perpendicular Gothic these assumed a wavy section , and the coping mouldings continued round the sides , as well as at top and bottom , mitring at the angles , as in many of the colleges at Oxford .",
