The first ship known to have entered the harbour was the Perseverance in 1813 , in search of flax trading possibilities , with the first European settlers arriving in 1823 or 1824 . This is the foundation for the claim that Bluff is the oldest permanent European settlement in the country . However , the missionary settlement at Kerikeri was both earlier and larger .

Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250 . Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856 , making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand . The Canterbury Association , which settled the Canterbury Plains , named the city after Christ Church , Oxford . The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square ; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area , except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south . Agriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch 's economy . The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city 's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries . Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities ' for Antarctic exploration , hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations . The city suffered a series of earthquakes between September 2010 and January 2012 , with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday , 22 February 2011 , in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage .",

Dunedin was the largest New Zealand city by territorial land area until superseded by Auckland with the formation of the Auckland Council in November 2010 . Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by M\u0101ori prior to the arrival of Europeans . The province and region of Otago takes its name from the Ngai Tahu village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour , which became a whaling station in the 1830s . In 1848 a Scottish settlement was established by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland . Between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city . Dunedin became wealthy during the Central Otago Gold Rush , beginning in the 1860s . In the mid-1860s , and between 1878 and 1881 , it was New Zealand 's largest urban area .

Three roll-on roll-off ( RORO ) vessels operate the 50 nautical miles ( 93 km ; 58 mi ) route , taking about three hours to complete the crossing . The inter-island rail ferry service began in August 1962 by the New Zealand Railways Department ( NZR ) . The service primarily provided a RORO rail link between its North and South Island networks , allowing NZR to compete directly with coastal shipping companies for inter-island freight . It also provided the first RORO road link between the two islands , which saw the Wellington to Picton ferries compete with , and then completely replace , the Union Company 's Wellington-Lyttelton ferry service . Today , the Interislander service is still well patronised despite competition on the Wellington-Picton sea route with Bluebridge and from airlines , carrying around one million passengers and 230,000 vehicles per year on 5,500 sailings . In 2017 , Interislander became part of The Great Journeys of New Zealand , a new tourism brand created by KiwiRail to unite their four scenic passenger services : Interislander , Northern Explorer , Coastal Pacific and the TranzAlpine .",
