  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",
  "/wiki/Zillergr\u00fcndl_Dam": "The Zillergr\u00fcndl Dam is an arch dam on the Ziller River in the upper Ziller Valley of Tyrol state , Austria . It is 16 km ( 10 mi ) east of Mayrhofen . The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power production and it supports a 360 MW pumped-storage power station . As part of the Zemm-Ziller Development , construction on the dam began in 1981 and it along with the H\u00e4usling Pumped Storage Power Plant were complete in 1986 . The power plant was fully commissioned by 1988 . The dam is the second tallest in Austria .",

  "/wiki/Pumped-storage": "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity ( PSH ) , or pumped hydroelectric energy storage ( PHES ) , is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing . The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water , pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation . Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps . During periods of high electrical demand , the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power . Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall , the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand , when electricity prices are highest . If the upper lake collects significant rainfall or is fed by a river then the plant may be a net energy producer in the manner of a traditional hydroelectric plant . Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources ( such as solar , wind ) and other renewables , or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources ( such as coal or nuclear ) to be saved for periods of higher demand . The reservoirs used with pumped storage are quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar power capacity , and generating periods are often less than half a day . Pumped storage is by far the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available , and , as of 2017 , the United States Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database reports that PSH accounts for over 95% of all active tracked storage installations worldwide , with a total installed nameplate capacity of over 184 GW , of which about 25 GW are in the United States . The round-trip energy efficiency of PSH varies between 70-80% , with some sources claiming up to 87% . The main disadvantage of PSH is the specialist nature of the site required , needing both geographical height and water availability . Suitable sites are therefore likely to be in hilly or mountainous regions , and potentially in areas of outstanding natural beauty , and therefore there are also social and ecological issues to overcome .",
  "/wiki/Malta-Reisseck_Power_Plant_Group": "The K\u00f6lnbrein Dam is an arch dam in the Hohe Tauern range within Carinthia , Austria . It was constructed between 1971 and 1979 and at 200 metres ( 660 ft ) high , it is the tallest dam in Austria . The dam 's reservoir serves as the primary storage in a three-stage pumped-storage power system that consists of nine dams , four hydroelectric power plants and a series of pipeline and penstocks . The complex is owned by Verbund power company and is referred to as the Malta-Reisseck Power Plant Group . The installed capacity of the group is 1,028.5 MW and its annual generation is 1,216 gigawatt-hours ( 4,380 TJ ) . While the dam 's reservoir was filling , several cracks appeared in the dam and it took more than a decade of repairs before the reservoir could operate at maximum levels . Currently , the Reisseck II pumped-storage power plant is under construction and will effectively connect both the Malta and Reisseck groups and add an additional 430 MW of production capacity .",

  "/wiki/Kaunertal": "The Kaunertal is a municipality and alpine valley in the Landeck district in the Austrian state of Tyrol . The municipality is located about 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) southeast of Landeck at the upper course of the Inn river . The Kaunertal valley is 28 km ( 17 mi ) in length and runs southeast from the town of Prutz ( 884 m ) to the Kaunertal Glacier . The valley is traversed by the Faggenbach river , which rises south of the Wei\u00dfseespitze mountain ( 3044 m ) and flows into the Inn river at Prutz ( 884 m ) , the site of a hydroelectric power station . The Gepatsch Reservoir ( Gepatsch Stausee ) , which is located on the upper course of the Fagge river , is 6 km ( 3.7 mi ) in length , has a capacity of 30,795 million gallons , and is formed by a rockfill dam that is 630 m ( 2,070 ft ) long and 130 m ( 430 ft ) high . The dam was constructed in 1961 . Water from the lake is used to generate electricity through a pipe system 13 km ( 8.1 mi ) in length , located at the south end of the Kaunertal . The generator facility at Prutz produces 620 million kilowatt hours per year . The lake surface is at an altitude of 1,820 m ( 5,970 ft ) .
