Midway also acquired the rights to video games that were originally developed by Williams Electronics and Atari Games , such as Defender , Joust , Robotron 2084 , Gauntlet , and the Rush series . The company 's predecessor Midway Manufacturing was founded in 1958 , as an amusement game manufacturer . In 1973 it moved into the interactive entertainment industry , developing and publishing arcade video games . The company scored its first mainstream hit with the U.S. distribution of Space Invaders in 1978 . Midway was purchased and re-incorporated in 1988 by WMS Industries Inc. After years as a leader in the arcade segment , Midway moved into the growing home video game market beginning in 1996 , the same year that it made its initial public offering of stock . In 1998 , WMS spun off its remaining shares of Midway . Midway was ranked the fourth largest-selling video game publisher in 2000 . After 2000 , Midway continued to develop and publish video games for home and handheld video game machines , but it experienced large annual net losses and engaged in a series of stock and debt offerings and other financings and borrowings . Sumner Redstone , the head of Viacom/CBS Corporation , increased his stake in Midway from about 15 % , in 1998 , to about 87 % by the end of 2007 .

Released on September 11 , 1977 , it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges ( a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 ) instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into the unit . The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers , a conjoined pair of paddle controllers , and a game cartridge : initially Combat , and later Pac-Man . The Atari VCS launched with nine simple , low-resolution games in 2 KiB cartridges . The system found its killer app with its version of Taito 's Space Invaders in 1980 and became widely successful , leading to the creation of Activision and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco . By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983-84 , games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for , such as Pitfall ! and its scrolling sequel Pitfall II : Lost Caverns . Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600 , Pac-Man and E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial , that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600 . Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel . In 1986 , the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible Atari 7800 , but these were not enough to turn things around , and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry . Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1 , 1992",

  "/wiki/Tron:_Legacy": "Tron : Legacy is a 2010 American science fiction/action film directed by Joseph Kosinski , in his feature directorial debut , from a screenplay written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis , based on a story by Horowitz , Kitsis , Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal . It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron , whose director Steven Lisberger returned to produce . The cast includes Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley , respectively , as well as Garrett Hedlund , Olivia Wilde , James Frain , Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen . The story follows Flynn 's adult son Sam , who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called the Grid , where Sam , his father , and the algorithm Quorra must stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world . Interest in creating a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following . After much speculation , Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron : Legacy , with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers . Kosinski was recruited as director two years later . As he was not optimistic about Disney 's Matrix-esque approach to the film , Kosinski filmed a high-concept , which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron : Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film . Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days , in and around the city 's central business district . Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work . Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects . Daft Punk composed the musical score , incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music",
