The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system .

The boxing schedule began on July 29 and ended on August 11 . Twelve boxing events were contested with the participation of 354 fighters from 81 countries . A Soviet-led boycott resulted in the withdrawals of the Soviet Union , Cuba , East Germany , Bulgaria and other Eastern Bloc nations from boxing competitions . At the 1980 Summer Olympics , that was impacted by an American-led boycott , Cuban boxers won 10 medals , with 6 of them being gold , and had again been expected to do well . However , the nation withdrew from the games following the announcement of the Soviet boycott . Te\u00f3filo Stevenson , who was going to try for his fourth Olympic gold medal before the boycott was officially announced , had previously defeated Tyrell Biggs twice ( one by knockout ) and Hermenegildo B\u00e1ez had previously defeated Henry Tillman . Soviet Alexander Yagubkin defeated both Biggs and Tillman during the USA-USSR duals . Cuban and Soviet boxers , however , were more seasoned than their American counterparts . While US athletes typically turned pro after the Olympics , while still in their early twenties , Cubans and the Soviets were not allowed to do so and stayed on in the amateurs , participating in multiple Olympic cycles . Journalist George Vecsey remarked after the conclusion of the games that Despite all the flag-waving euphoria in the United States over all those medals in Los Angeles , the Summer Games were a made-in-Disneyland reproduction of the Games because there were no Soviet runners , no Cuban boxers , no East German swimmers .

The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week , in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists . The 1972 Summer Olympics were the second Summer Olympics to be held in Germany , after the 1936 Games in Berlin , which had taken place under the Nazi regime .
