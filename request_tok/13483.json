  "/wiki/License": "A license ( American English ) or licence ( British English ) is an official permission or permit to do , use , or own something ( as well as the document of that permission or permit ) . A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties . A shorthand definition of a license is an authorization to use licensed material . In particular , a license may be issued by authorities , to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden . It may require paying a fee or proving a capability . The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity , and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations . A licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use ( such as copying software or using a patented invention ) to a licensee , sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor . A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself , including a term , territory , renewal provisions , and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor . Term : many licenses are valid for a particular length of time . This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase , or market conditions change . It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement . Territory : a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to .",
  "/wiki/AngularJS": "AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications . It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model-view-controller ( MVC ) and model-view-viewmodel ( MVVM ) architectures , along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications . AngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack , consisting of MongoDB database , Express.js web application server framework , Angular.js itself , and Node.js server runtime environment . Version 1.7.x is on Long Term Support until July 1st 2021 . After that date AngularJS will no longer be updated and Angular is suggested instead .",
  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",

  "/wiki/Backbone.js": "Backbone.js is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the Model-view-presenter ( MVP ) application design paradigm . Backbone is known for being lightweight , as its only hard dependency is on one JavaScript library , Underscore.js , plus jQuery for use of the full library . It is designed for developing single-page web applications , and for keeping various parts of web applications ( e.g . multiple clients and the server ) synchronized . Backbone was created by Jeremy Ashkenas , who is also known for CoffeeScript and Underscore.js . When handling the DOM Backbone.js adopts an imperative programming style , in contrast with a declarative programming style ( common in AngularJS using data-attributes ) . Trying to provide the minimal set of data-structuring ( models and collections ) and user interface ( views and URLs ) , leaves to the developer the choice of extensions for enhanced functionality . For example , one can use nested views with Backbone Layout Manager or model-view binding with ReSTbasis .",

  "/wiki/Meteor_(web_framework)": "Meteor , or MeteorJS , is a free and open-source isomorphic JavaScript web framework written using Node.js . Meteor allows for rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform ( Android , iOS , Web ) code . It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publish-subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code . On the client , Meteor can be used with its own Blaze templating engine , as well as with the Angular or React frameworks . Meteor is developed by Meteor Software . The startup was incubated by Y Combinator and received $ 11.2M in funding from Andreessen Horowitz in July 2012 . Meteor raised an additional $ 20M in Series B funding from Matrix Partners , Andreessen Horowitz and Trinity Ventures . It intends to become profitable by offering Galaxy , an enterprise-grade hosting environment for Meteor applications .",
