  "/wiki/Cracow": "Krak\u00f3w ( , , , ) , by convention , spelled Cracow in English , is the second largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland . Situated on the Vistula River in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship , the city dates back to the 7th century . Krak\u00f3w was the official capital of Poland until 1596 and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic , economic , cultural and artistic life . Cited as one of Europe 's most beautiful cities , its Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland 's second most important city . It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading centre of Central Europe in 965 . With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century , Krak\u00f3w reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre . The city has a population of about 770,000 , with approximately 8 million additional people living within a radius of its main square . After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany at the start of World War II , the newly defined Distrikt Krakau ( Krak\u00f3w District ) became the capital of Germany 's General Government . The Jewish population of the city was forced into a walled zone known as the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto , from which they were sent to German extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz never to return , and the Nazi concentration camps like P\u0142asz\u00f3w . However , the city was spared from destruction and major bombing . In 1978 , Karol Wojty\u0142a , archbishop of Krak\u00f3w , was elevated to the papacy as Pope John Paul II - the first ever Slavic pope , and the first non-Italian pope in 455 years .",
  "/wiki/\u0141\u00f3d\u017a": "\u0141\u00f3d\u017a ( Polish : [ wut\u0255 ] ( listen ) ) , written in English as Lodz , [ a ] is the third-largest city in Poland and a former industrial centre . Located in the central part of the country , it has a population of 682,679 ( 2019 ) . It is the capital of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship , and is located approximately 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) south-west of Warsaw . The city 's coat of arms is an example of canting , as it depicts a boat ( \u0142\u00f3d\u017a in Polish ) , which alludes to the city 's name . \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was once a small settlement that first appeared in written records in around 1332 . In the early 15th century it was granted city rights , but remained a rather small and insubstantial town . It was the property of Kuyavian bishops and clergy until the end of the 18th century , when \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by Prussia as a result of the second partition of Poland . Following the collapse of the independent Duchy of Warsaw , the city became part of Congress Poland , a client state of the Russian Empire . It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced rapid growth in the cloth industry and in population due to the inflow of migrants , most notably Germans and Jews . Ever since the industrialization of the area , the city has struggled with many difficulties such as multinationalism and social inequality , which were vividly documented in the novel The Promised Land written by Polish Nobel Prize-winning author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont . The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city , where luxurious mansions coexisted with redbrick factories and dilapidated tenement houses . After Poland regained its independence in 1918 , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a grew to be one of the largest Polish cities and one of the most multicultural and industrial centers in Europe .",

Its historical old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Once described as the Paris of the North , Warsaw was believed to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world until World War II . Bombed at the start of the German invasion in 1939 , the city withstood a siege for which it was later awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for heroism , the Virtuti Militari . Deportations of the Jewish population to concentration camps led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the destruction of the Ghetto after a month of combat . A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive . Warsaw gained the new title of Phoenix City because of its extensive history and complete reconstruction after World War II , which had left over 85% of its buildings in ruins . Warsaw is one of Europe 's most dynamic metropolitan cities .",

For centuries , Gdynia remained a small farming and fishing village on the Baltic coast . At the beginning of the 20th-century Gdynia became a seaside resort town and experienced an inflow of tourists . This triggered an increase in local population . After Poland regained its independence in 1918 , a decision was made to construct a Polish seaport in Gdynia , between the Free City of Danzig ( a semi-autonomous city-state under joint League of Nations and Polish administration ) and German Pomerania , making Gdynia the primary economic hub of the Polish Corridor . It was then that the town was given a more cosmopolitan character with modernism being the dominant architectural style and emerged as a city in 1926 . The rapid development of Gdynia was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II . The German troops refrained from deliberate bombing . The newly built port and shipyard were completely destroyed during the war . The population of the city suffered much heavier losses as most of the inhabitants were evicted and expelled .",

In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town and , in the 14th and 15th centuries , a member of the Hanseatic League . In the interwar period , owing to its multi-ethnic make-up and history , Gda\u0144sk lay in a disputed region between Poland and Germany , which became known as the Polish Corridor . The city 's ambiguous political status was exploited , furthering tension between the two countries , which would ultimately culminate in the Invasion of Poland and the first clash of the Second World War just outside the city limits , followed by the flight and expulsion of the majority of the previous population in 1945 ."
