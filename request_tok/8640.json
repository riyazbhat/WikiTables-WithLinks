  "/wiki/Penalty_shootout": "The penalty shootout is a method of determining a winner in sports matches that would have otherwise been drawn or tied . The rules for penalty shootouts vary between sports and even different competitions ; however , the usual form is similar to penalty shots in that a single player takes one shot on goal from a specified spot , the only defender being the goalkeeper . If the result is still tied , the shootout usually continues on a goal-for-goal basis , with the teams taking shots alternately , and the one that scores a goal unmatched by the other team is declared the winner . This may continue until every player has taken a shot , after which players may take extra shots , until the tie is broken , and is also known as sudden death .",
