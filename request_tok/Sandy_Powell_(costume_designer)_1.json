  "/wiki/The_Irishman": "The Irishman ( also titled onscreen as I Heard You Paint Houses ) is a 2019 American epic crime film directed and produced by Martin Scorsese and written by Steven Zaillian , based on the 2004 book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt . It stars Robert De Niro , Al Pacino , and Joe Pesci , with Ray Romano , Bobby Cannavale , Anna Paquin , Stephen Graham , Stephanie Kurtzuba , Jesse Plemons , and Harvey Keitel in supporting roles . The film follows Frank Sheeran ( De Niro ) , a truck driver who becomes a hitman involved with mobster Russell Bufalino ( Pesci ) and his crime family , including his time working for the powerful Teamster Jimmy Hoffa ( Pacino ) . In September 2014 , after years of development hell , The Irishman was announced as Scorsese 's next film after Silence ( 2016 ) . De Niro , who also served as producer , and Pacino were confirmed that month , as was Pesci , who came out of his unofficial retirement to star after being asked numerous times to take the role . Principal photography began in September 2017 in New York City and in the Mineola and Williston Park sections of Long Island , and wrapped in March 2018 . Scenes were filmed with a custom three-camera rig to help facilitate the extensive de-aging digital effects that made De Niro , Pacino , and Pesci appear younger in many of the film 's flashbacks . With a production budget of $ 159 million and a runtime of 209 minutes , it is among the most expensive and longest films of Scorsese 's career . The Irishman premiered at the 57th New York Film Festival , and had a limited theatrical release on November 1 , 2019 , followed by digital streaming on Netflix starting on November 27 , 2019 . The film received widespread critical acclaim , with particular praise for Scorsese 's direction and the performances of De Niro , Pacino , and Pesci . The film received numerous accolades and nominations ; at the 77th Golden Globe Awards , it was nominated for five awards , including Best Motion Picture - Drama ."
