  "/wiki/Annunciation_(Leonardo)": "Annunciation is a painting attributed to the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci , dating from circa 1472-1475 . It is housed in the Uffizi gallery of Florence , Italy . Leonardo da Vinci might have finished the Annunciation in his early twenties . The subject matter is drawn from Luke 1.26-39 and depicts the angel Gabriel , sent by God to announce to a virgin , Mary , that she would miraculously conceive and give birth to a son , to be named Jesus , and to be called the Son of God whose reign would never end . The subject was very popular for artworks and had been depicted many times in the art of Florence , including several examples by the Early Renaissance painter Fra Angelico . The details of its commission and its early history remain obscure . In 1867 , following Gustav Waagen methods , Baron Liphart identified this Annunciation , newly arrived in the Uffizi Gallery from the convent of Monte Oliveto Maggiore , as by the young Leonardo , still working in the studio of his master Verrocchio . Before Liphart the painting had been attributed to Domenico Ghirlandaio . [ citation needed ]",

One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited , it is also one of the largest and best known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works , particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance . After the ruling house of Medici died out , their art collections were gifted to the city of Florence under the famous Patto di famiglia negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa , the last Medici heiress . The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums . The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century , and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public , formally becoming a museum in 1865 .

After running two important art galleries in the 1930s and 1940s , he came to wider public notice on television , presenting a succession of programmes on the arts during the 1950s and 1960s , culminating in the Civilisation series in 1969 . The son of rich parents , Clark was introduced to the arts at an early age . Among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin , which instilled in him the belief that everyone should have access to great art . After coming under the influence of the connoisseur and dealer Bernard Berenson , Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford aged twenty-seven , and three years later he was put in charge of Britain 's National Gallery . His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public . During the Second World War , when the collection was moved from London for safe keeping , Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz . After the war , and three years as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford , Clark surprised many by accepting the chairmanship of the UK 's first commercial television network . Once the service had been successfully launched he agreed to write and present programmes about the arts . These established him as a household name in Britain , and he was asked to create the first colour series about the arts , Civilisation , first broadcast in 1969 in Britain and in many other countries soon afterwards . Among many honours , Clark was knighted at the unusually young age of thirty-five , and three decades later was made a life peer shortly before the first transmission of Civilisation . Three decades after his death , Clark was celebrated in an exhibition at Tate Britain in London , prompting a reappraisal of his career by a new generation of critics and historians",

The picture depicts the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as recorded in the Biblical Gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke . The angel to the left is recorded as having been painted by the youthful Leonardo , a fact which has excited so much special comment and mythology , that the importance and value of the picture as a whole and within the \u0153uvre of Verrocchio is often overlooked .

There are two of Leonardo 's preliminary sketches for this piece in the British Museum , although the painting was probably overpainted by other hands . The preliminary sketches and the painting itself suggest that Leonardo was concentrating on the idea of sight . [ a ] The child is thought to be guiding his mother 's hands into his central vision .

After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors , notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake , and by private donations , which today account for two-thirds of the collection .

In 1500 she met King Louis XII of France in Milan on a diplomatic mission to persuade him not to send his troops against Mantua . She was a prolific letter-writer and maintained a lifelong correspondence with her sister-in-law Elisabetta Gonzaga . Lucrezia Borgia was another sister-in-law ; she later became the mistress of Isabella 's husband . She was described as having been physically attractive , albeit slightly plump ; however , she also possessed lively eyes and was of lively grace . Isabella d'Este grew up in a cultured family in the city-state of Ferrara . She received a fine classical education and as a girl met many famous humanist scholars and artists . Due to the vast amount of extant correspondence between Isabella and her family and friends , her life is unusually well documented",
  "/wiki/Madonna_of_the_Yarnwinder": "The Madonna of the Yarnwinder ( Italian : Madonna dei Fusi , Madonna of the Spindles ) is a subject depicted by Leonardo da Vinci in at least one , and perhaps two paintings begun in 1499 or later . Leonardo was recorded as being at work on one such picture in Florence in 1501 for Florimond Robertet , a secretary to King Louis XII of France . This may have been delivered to the French court in 1507 , though scholars are divided on this point . The subject is known today from several versions of which two , called the Buccleuch Madonna and the Lansdowne Madonna , are thought to be partly by Leonardo 's hand . The underdrawings of both paintings show similar experimental changes made to the composition ( or pentimenti ) , suggesting that both evolved concurrently in Leonardo 's workshop . The composition shows the Virgin Mary seated in a landscape with the Christ child , who gazes at a yarnwinder used to collect spun yarn . The yarnwinder serves both as a symbol of Mary 's domesticity and as a foreshadowing of the Cross on which Christ was crucified . The painting 's dynamic composition and implied narrative was highly influential on later High Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child by artists such as Raphael and Andrea del Sarto",
  "/wiki/Scottish_National_Gallery": "The Scottish National Gallery ( formerly the National Gallery of Scotland ) is the national art gallery of Scotland . It is located on The Mound in central Edinburgh , close to Princes Street . The building was designed in a neoclassical style by William Henry Playfair , and first opened to the public in 1859 . The gallery houses Scotland 's national collection of fine art , spanning Scottish and international art from the beginning of the Renaissance up to the start of the 20th century . The Scottish National Gallery is run by National Galleries of Scotland , a public body that also owns the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery . Because of its architectural similarity , the Scottish National Gallery is frequently confused by visitors with the neighbouring Royal Scottish Academy Building ( RSA ) , a separate institution which works closely with the Scottish National Gallery",

  "/wiki/Terminus_post_quem": "Terminus post quem ( limit after which , often abbreviated to TPQ ) and terminus ante quem ( limit before which , abbreviated to TAQ ) specify the known limits of dating for events . A terminus post quem is the earliest time the event may have happened , and a terminus ante quem is the latest . An event may well have both a terminus post quem and a terminus ante quem , in which case the limits of the possible range of dates are known at both ends , but many events have just one or the other . Similarly , terminus ad quem ( limit to which ) is the latest possible date of a non-punctual event ( period , era , etc . ) , while terminus a quo ( limit from which ) is the earliest . The concepts are similar to those of upper and lower bounds in mathematics",
