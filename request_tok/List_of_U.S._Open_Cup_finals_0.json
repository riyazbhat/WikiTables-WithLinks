Soccer was not as hard-hit as some other sports , but all leagues felt the impact ; in fact the Cechie team of Chicago lost every member of its roster to enlistment . The United States Soccer Football Association issued a call to its member associations for teams to resist the temptation to strengthen their teams at the expense of others - when wealthy , but decimated teams eye the poorer but complete teams , their wallets and checkbooks should remain pocketed in the name of fair play . A welcome consequence of the war situation was a willingness of the USFA 's own warring factions to end their dispute and work together in relative harmony during those trying times . Many soccer organizations launched fund raising campaigns and benefit matches to raise money to provide support for US soldiers through , among other means , the provision of soccer equipment and gear to enhance their recreational opportunities . One such project was the Soccer Football Chain Letter Fund launched by Thomas Cahill and the USFA . Other welcome events included record attendance figures in some late-round games of the National Challenge Cup that were well promoted . One of the major topics of discussion was the pros and cons of substitutes . At the time the laws did not specifically allow nor outlaw substitutes per se , but the consensus was that eventually they would become a reality . For the 1917-18 year , the USFA reported receipts of $ 6,318.64 and disbursements of $ 3,034.39 , giving the USFA a net worth of $ 2,784.25 in cash and one $ 500.00 Liberty Bond",
