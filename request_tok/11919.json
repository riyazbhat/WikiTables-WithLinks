  "/wiki/Charlie_Haden": "Charles Edward Haden ( August 6 , 1937 - July 11 , 2014 ) was an American jazz double bass player , bandleader , composer and educator whose career spanned more than fifty years . In the late 1950s , Haden was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet . Haden revolutionized the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz . German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt wrote that Haden 's ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman 's free-form solos ( rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies ) was both radical and mesmerizing . His virtuosity lies\u2026in an incredible ability to make the double bass 'sound out ' . Haden cultivated the instrument 's gravity as no one else in jazz . He is a master of simplicity which is one of the most difficult things to achieve . ) Haden played a vital role in this revolutionary new approach , evolving a way of playing that sometimes complemented the soloist and sometimes moved independently . In this respect , as did his predecessor bassists Jimmy Blanton and Charles Mingus , Haden helped liberate the bassist from a strictly accompanying role to becoming a more direct participant in group improvisation . In 1969 , he formed his first band , the Liberation Music Orchestra , featuring arrangements by pianist Carla Bley . In the late 1960s , he became a member of pianist Keith Jarrett 's trio , quartet and quintet . In the 1980s , he formed his band , Quartet West .",

Motian began his career as a bandleader in the early 1970s . Perhaps his two most notable groups were a longstanding trio of guitarist Bill Frisell and saxophonist Joe Lovano , and the Electric Bebop Band which featured the drummer working mostly with younger musicians doing interpretations of bebop standards .",
