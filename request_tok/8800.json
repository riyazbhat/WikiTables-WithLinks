  "/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party": "The Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) is a unionist political party in Northern Ireland favouring British identity . It was founded in 1971 during the Troubles by Ian Paisley , who led the party for the next 37 years . Now led by Arlene Foster , it is equal with Sinn F\u00e9in in having the most seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly , and it is the fifth-largest party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom . The DUP evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party and has historically strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster , the church Paisley founded . During the Troubles , the DUP were opposed to power-sharing with Irish nationalists or republicans as a means of resolving the conflict , and likewise rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs . It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973 , the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 , and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 . In 2006 , the DUP co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and agreed to share power with the republican party Sinn Fein who agreed to support the Police Service , courts , and rule of law . The party has been linked to various loyalist paramilitary groups , namely Ulster Resistance ( URM ) and Third Force . The URM was formed on 10 November 1986 by DUP politicians Paisley , Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster , with the stated aim to take direct action as and when required to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism . Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined . The following year , the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland , which were shared out between the URM , the Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) and the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) . In 1989 , URM members attempted to trade Shorts ' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime .",
