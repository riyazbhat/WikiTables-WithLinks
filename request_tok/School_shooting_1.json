  "/wiki/Taiwan": "Taiwan ( Chinese : \u81fa\u7063 ; pinyin : T\u00e1iw\u0101n ) , [ II ] officially the Republic of China ( ROC ) , [ I ] is a state in East Asia . Neighbouring states include the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to the north-west , Japan to the north-east , and the Philippines to the south . The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres ( 13,826 sq mi ) , with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third , where its highly urbanised population is concentrated . Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

Soon afterwards they attacked a van , killing two Israeli Arab women while injuring a third and entered an apartment building in the town of Ma'alot , where they killed a couple and their four-year-old son . From there , they headed for the Netiv Meir Elementary School , where they took more than 115 people ( including 105 children ) hostage on 15 May 1974 , in Ma'alot . Most of the hostages were teenagers from a high school in Safad on a Gadna field trip spending the night in Ma'alot . The hostage-takers soon issued demands for the release of 23 Palestinian militants from Israeli prisons , or else they would kill the students . On the second day of the standoff , the Sayeret Matkal stormed the building . During the takeover , the hostage-takers killed children with grenades and automatic weapons . Ultimately , 25 hostages , including 22 children , were killed and 68 more were injured .",

  "/wiki/Capital_punishment": "Capital punishment , also known as the death penalty , is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . The sentence ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence , whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an execution . A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as condemned , and is said to be on death row . Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes , capital offences or capital felonies , and vary depending on the jurisdiction , but commonly include serious offences such as murder , mass murder , aggravated cases of rape , child rape , child sexual abuse , terrorism , treason , espionage , sedition , piracy , aircraft hijacking , drug trafficking and drug dealing , war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide , and in some cases , the most serious acts of recidivism , aggravated robbery , and kidnapping . Etymologically , the term capital ( lit . of the head , derived via the Latin capitalis from caput , head ) in this context alluded to execution by beheading . Fifty-six countries retain capital punishment , 106 countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes , eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes ( while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes ) , and 28 are abolitionist in practice . Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states , and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region . In the European Union , Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment . The Council of Europe , which has 47 member states , has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely , through Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights . However , this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it , and they do not include Armenia , Russia , and Azerbaijan . The United Nations General Assembly has adopted , in 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2012 and 2014 , non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions , with a view to eventual abolition .",

The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE , in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds . Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets , probably meaning City of Shalem after a Canaanite deity , during the Canaanite period ( 14th century BCE ) . During the Israelite period , significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE ( Iron Age II ) , and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah . In 1538 , the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters - known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries . In 2015 , Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents , comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis , 350,000 Haredi Jews and 300,000 Palestinians .",
  "/wiki/Israeli_Arab": "Arab citizens of Israel , or Arab Israelis , are Israeli citizens who are Arab . Many Arab citizens of Israel self-identify as Palestinian and commonly self-designate themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel or Israeli Palestinians . According to a 2017 survey by University of Haifa professor Sammy Smooha , 16% of the Arab population prefers the term Israeli Arab , while the largest and fastest growing proportion prefers Palestinian in Israel , and 17% prefer Palestinian Arab , rejecting entirely the identity of Israeli . The traditional vernacular of most Arab citizens , irrespective of religion , is Levantine Arabic , including Lebanese Arabic in northern of Israel , Palestinian dialect of Arabic in central Israel and Bedouin dialects across the Negev desert ; having absorbed much Hebrew loanwords and phrases , the modern dialect of Arab citizens of Israel is defined by some as the Israeli Arabic dialect . Most Arab citizens of Israel are functionally bilingual , their second language being Modern Hebrew . By religious affiliation , most are Muslim , particularly of the Sunni branch of Islam . There is a significant Arab Christian minority from various denominations as well as the Druze , among other religious communities . According to Israel 's Central Bureau of Statistics , the Arab population in 2019 was estimated at 1,890,000 , representing 20.95% of the country 's population . The majority of these identify themselves as Arab or Palestinian by nationality and Israeli by citizenship . Arab citizens of Israel mostly live in Arab-majority towns and cities ; eight of Israel 's ten poorest cities are Arab . The vast majority attend separate schools to Jewish Israelis , and Arab political parties have never joined a government coalition . Many have family ties to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as to Palestinian refugees in Jordan , Syria and Lebanon .",
  "/wiki/Levant": "The Levant ( Arabic : \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0645 , Sh\u0101m , English /l\u0259\u02c8v\u00e6nt/ ) is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Western Asia . In its narrowest sense , it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria , which included present-day Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine . In its widest historical sense , the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands ; that is , it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores , extending from Greece to Cyrenaica in eastern Libya . The term entered English in the late 15th century from French . It derives from the Italian Levante , meaning rising , implying the rising of the sun in the east , and is broadly equivalent to the term al-Mashriq ( Arabic : \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0642 , [ \u0294al.ma\u0283.riq ] ) , meaning the eastern place , where the sun rises . In the 13th and 14th centuries , the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean , including Greece , Anatolia , Syria-Palestine , and Egypt , that is , the lands east of Venice . Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt . In 1581 , England set up the Levant Company to monopolize commerce with the Ottoman Empire . The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I . This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Jordan , and Cyprus . Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon . Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references .",

The militants , all of whom were foreign nationals , comprising one Chechen , three Arabs and two Afghans , entered the school and opened fire on school staff and children , killing 149 people including 132 schoolchildren , ranging between eight and eighteen years of age making it the world 's fourth deadliest school massacre . A rescue operation was launched by the Pakistan Army 's Special Services Group ( SSG ) special forces , who killed all six terrorists and rescued 960 people . According to various news agencies and commentators , the nature and preparation of the attack was very similar to that of the Beslan school hostage crisis that occurred in the North Ossetia-Alania region of the Russian Federation in 2004 . Pakistan responded to the attacks by lifting its moratorium on the death penalty , intensifying the War in North-West Pakistan and authorizing military courts to try civilians through a constitutional amendment . On 2 December 2015 , Pakistan hanged four militants involved in the Peshawar massacre . The mastermind of the attack , Omar Khorasani , was believed to have been killed in a drone strike in eastern Afghanistan on 18 October 2017 , but was added to the U.S State Department 's Rewards for Justice wanted list on March 7 , 2018 , indicating that he is still alive .

Since 2016 , the Taliban 's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada . From 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan , and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia , or Islamic law . The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students ( talib ) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools , and fought during the Soviet-Afghan War . Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar , the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan , sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords . The totalitarian Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital was transferred to Kandahar . It held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks . At its peak , formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban 's government was acknowledged by only three nations : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . The group later regrouped as an insurgency movement to fight the American-backed Karzai administration and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in the War in Afghanistan . The Taliban have been condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law , which has resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans , especially women . During their rule from 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians , denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth , burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes . According to the United Nations , the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010 , 80% in 2011 , and 80% in 2012 .",
