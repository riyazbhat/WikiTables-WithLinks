A large part of the river is within the boundaries of Molesworth Station . Northern tributaries along the middle segment of Waiau Toa / Clarence River ( e.g. , Mead Stream , Dee Stream , Branch Stream , Muzzle Stream ) cut through an uplifted , folded and rotated block of limestone and marl that accumulated on the seafloor from the late Cretaceous through the Paleocene and middle Eocene ( 75-45 million years ago ) . Exposures of this limestone - the Amuri Limestone - provide some of the most complete records for this time interval of Earth 's history . They have provided important insights to our understanding of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) , Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 ( ETM-2 ) , and other Paleogene hyperthermal events A slip triggered by the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake blocked the Waiau Toa / Clarence River 10 to 12 km from its mouth , with water building up behind the slip .
