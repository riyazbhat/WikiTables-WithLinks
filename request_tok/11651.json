Played on January 12 , 1969 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , the game is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in both American football history and in the recorded history of sports . The 18-point underdog American Football League ( AFL ) champion New York Jets defeated the National Football League ( NFL ) champion Baltimore Colts by a score of 16-7 .

Baltimore posted a 13-1 record in the regular season and shut out the Cleveland Browns 34-0 in the NFL Championship Game . The Jets were 11-3 in the regular season , and defeated the Oakland Raiders 27-23 in the AFL Championship Game . Jets quarterback Joe Namath famously made an appearance three days before the Super Bowl at the Miami Touchdown Club and personally guaranteed his team 's victory . His team backed up his words by controlling most of the game , building a 16-0 lead by the fourth quarter off of a touchdown run by Matt Snell and three field goals by Jim Turner . Colts quarterback Earl Morrall threw three interceptions before being replaced by Johnny Unitas , who then led Baltimore to its only touchdown , during the last few minutes of the game . With the victory , the Jets were the only winning team to score only one touchdown ( either offensive , defensive , or special teams ) until the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII .

The league expanded to 28 teams with the addition of the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . This fulfilled one of the conditions agreed to in 1966 for the 1970 AFL-NFL merger , which called for the league to expand to 28 teams by 1970 or soon thereafter .

Early in this period the Dolphins won their only two Super Bowls in consecutive seasons , in the process achieving the only modern-day perfect season in any major professional sports league during only their third year in the NFL . Much of this success was orchestrated by coach Don Shula who joined the team in 1970 and stayed with them until his retirement in 1995 . After Shula retired in 1995 , the Dolphins remained a force for six years under successors Jimmy Johnson and Dave Wannstedt , but since 2002 and especially since 2004 have fallen on harder times , reaching the postseason only twice in the twelve seasons since , and during the mid-2000s , briefly intensified the Dolphins-Patriots rivalry , when Nick Saban , a former Bill Belichick assistant was hired as the Dolphins head coach in 2005 and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins the following year . In 2007 , if not for their overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens , would 've suffered an imperfect season , a year before the Detroit Lions became the first team to go winless since the NFL expanded to a 16-game schedule .

The two expansion teams were slotted into the two remaining divisions that previously had only four teams ( while the other four had five teams ) : the AFC Central ( Jaguars ) and the NFC West ( Panthers ) . Meanwhile , the two teams in Los Angeles relocated to other cities : the Rams transferred to St. Louis ( but would return to Los Angeles in 2016 ) and the Raiders moved back to Oakland ; this would be the start of a 20-year absence for the NFL in Los Angeles . During the course of the season it emerged that the Cleveland Browns would relocate to Baltimore for the 1996 season . The Raiders move was not announced until after the schedule had been announced , which resulted in a problem in the third week of the season when both the Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers had games scheduled to air on NBC which ended up overlapping each other . The Raiders game was rescheduled for 10:00 AM PDT in case they were to relocate and NBC was given the doubleheader so that both Bay Area teams had their games televised locally . The season ended with Super Bowl XXX , when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium . They became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years . This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shulas last season as coach .",

The club was founded in 1959 by Barron Hilton and played the 1960 season in Los Angeles as part of the American Football League ( AFL ) . In the next season , the Chargers moved to San Diego . In 2017 , the Chargers relocated back to the Los Angeles area . The franchise has experienced three major periods of success . The first was from 1960 to 1965 , when the Chargers were AFL West champions five times and AFL champions once . The second was from 1978 to 1982 , when the Chargers had winning seasons ( seasons with more wins than losses ) in each of these years , and won three consecutive division championships for the second time in franchise history . The most recent accomplishments range from 2004 to 2009 , with the franchise reaching the playoffs five times in six years . Their only Super Bowl appearance was in 1994 .

The 49ers defeated the Chargers by the score of 49-26 , becoming the first team to win five Super Bowl championships . The game was played on January 29 , 1995 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami , Florida ( now part of the suburb of Miami Gardens , which became a separate city in 2003 ) . This game is regarded as 49ers quarterback Steve Young 's final leap out of the shadow of his predecessor , Joe Montana , who had won four Super Bowls with the 49ers ( in 1982 , 1985 , 1989 , and 1990 ) , two with Young as the backup quarterback . With Young at the helm , and a defense consisting of several veteran free agents who joined the team during the previous offseason , San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13-3 record , and led the league in total points scored ( 505 ) . The Chargers , on the other hand , were regarded as a Cinderella team , and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11-5 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins . This was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters . The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total touchdowns both remain Super Bowl records . Still , the 49ers controlled most of the game , with Young completing touchdown passes in each of the 49ers ' first two drives . The Chargers were able to cut the deficit late in the first quarter , 14-7 , on a 13-play , 78-yard drive , but could not slow down San Francisco afterwards . Young was named the Super Bowl MVP , throwing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes , and completing 24 out of 36 passes for 325 yards . Despite the predicted blowout ( 18\u00bd points is the largest margin a team has been favored by in a Super Bowl ) , the fact that San Diego did not have as much national appeal nor a relatively large core fan base , and two teams from California playing , which could have significantly diminished interest along the East Coast , the telecast of the game on ABC still had a Nielsen rating of 41.3 .",

Also , a selection committee of media and league personnel named a special NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team , honoring the best NFL players from the first 75 seasons . The Phoenix Cardinals changed their name to Arizona Cardinals in an attempt to widen their appeal to the entire state of Arizona instead of just the Phoenix area . The name was initially resisted by Bill Bidwill . The Seattle Seahawks played their first three regular season home games at Husky Stadium because the Kingdome , the Seahawks ' regular home field , was undergoing repairs for damaged tiles on its roof . The Seahawks returned for the 2000 and 2001 seasons while their new stadium was under construction . This marked the last season until 2016 that the city of Los Angeles had an NFL team and the last one until 2017 that the city had two . Both the Rams and the Raiders left the city following the season . The Rams moved east to St. Louis , Missouri after being in Los Angeles for 49 years , while the Raiders left after twelve seasons to return to their previous home in Oakland , California . The Rams eventually returned in 2016 after failing to reach an agreement with St. Louis on a new stadium .

The return of the Browns increased the number of teams to 31 , the first time the league had played with an odd number of teams since 1966 . This required the NFL to give at least one team a bye each week ; previously , barring extreme circumstances , a club never received a bye during the first two weeks or last seven weeks of the season . Under a new system , for ten weeks of the season ( Week # 1 , Week # 2 and Week # 10 to Week # 17 ) , one team received a bye , and for seven weeks of the season ( Week # 3 to Week # 9 ) , three teams received a bye . This format would continue until the Houston Texans joined the NFL in 2002 , returning the league to an even number of teams . The start of the 1999 NFL Season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day , a change from the previous seasons : due to the Y2K concerns , the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday January 1 , 2000 , and did not want teams traveling on that day . This was also done to avoid competing against college football 's New Years Day bowl games . Week 17 games were held on January 2 , 2000 , and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8 and 9 , with the bye week before the Super Bowl removed to accommodate the one-week adjustment .
