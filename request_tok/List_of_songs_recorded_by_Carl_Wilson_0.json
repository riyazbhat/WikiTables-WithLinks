  "/wiki/Carl_Wilson": "Carl Dean Wilson ( December 21 , 1946 - February 6 , 1998 ) was an American musician , singer , and songwriter who co-founded the Beach Boys . He is best remembered as their lead guitarist , as the youngest brother of bandmates Brian and Dennis Wilson , and as the group 's de facto leader in the early 1970s . He was also the band 's musical director on stage from 1965 until his death . Influenced by the guitar playing of Chuck Berry and the Ventures , Wilson 's initial role in the group was that of lead guitarist and backing vocals , but he performed lead vocals on several of their later hits , including God Only Knows ( 1966 ) , Good Vibrations ( 1966 ) , and Kokomo ( 1988 ) . Unlike other members of the band , he often played alongside the studio musicians employed during the group 's critical and commercial peak in the mid 1960s . After Brian 's reduced involvement with the group , Carl produced the bulk of their albums between 20/20 ( 1969 ) and Holland ( 1973 ) , where the production was nominally credited to the Beach Boys . Concurrently , he spent several years challenging his draft status as a conscientious objector . During the 1980s , Wilson attempted to launch a solo career , releasing the albums Carl Wilson ( 1981 ) and Young Blood ( 1983 ) . In the 1990s , he recorded material with Gerry Beckley and Robert Lamm , later released for the posthumous album Like a Brother ( 2000 ) . He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys in 1988 . Wilson was also a member of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness , a religious corporation . He died , aged 51 , of lung cancer in 1998 .",

It was met with a warm critical reception and reached number 29 on the US record charts , becoming their highest-charting LP of new music in the US since 1967 . In the UK , Surf 's Up peaked at number 15 , continuing a string of top 40 records that had not abated since 1965 . Both the album 's title and cover artwork are an ironic , self-aware nod to the band 's early surfing image . It was named after the closing track Surf 's Up , a song which had been written and partially recorded in 1966 for the group 's unfinished album Smile . Surf 's Up 's creative direction was largely influenced by newly employed band manager Jack Rieley , who strove to reinvent the group 's image and reintroduce them to the era 's counterculture . Two singles were issued in the US : Long Promised Road and Surf 's Up . Only the former charted , peaking at number 89 . In 2004 , the album was voted 154 in a German edition of Rolling Stone 's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and ranked 61 on Pitchfork Media 's The Top 100 Albums Of The 1970s .

  "/wiki/The_Beach_Boys": "The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne , California in 1961 . The group 's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson , their cousin Mike Love , and their friend Al Jardine . Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs , they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era . The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R & B to create their unique sound , and with Brian as composer , arranger , producer , and de facto leader , they often incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways . The Beach Boys began as a garage band led by Brian and managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry . In 1963 , the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance , dubbed the California Sound . From 1965 , they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and Good Vibrations single raised the group 's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . After scrapping the album Smile in 1967 , Brian 's contributions diminished due to his mental health issues . The group 's commercial momentum faltered , and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound , they were dismissed by early rock critics as the archetypal pop music cop-outs . Carl took over as the band 's musical leader until the late 1970s , during which they rebounded with successful worldwide concert tours . Personal struggles , creative disagreements , and the overshadowing success of the band 's greatest hits albums precipitated their transition into an oldies act .",

Jones had already cut it for United Artists earlier in the decade but a new version was released as a single in 1969 on the Musicor label and rose to # 6 on the Billboard country singles chart . The song seemingly describes the feelings of a man towards a woman , presumably his wife , who no longer loves him , but he feels satisfied just having her around .
