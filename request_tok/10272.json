It is also called The Big Owe to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole . The stadium is the largest by seating capacity in Canada . After the Olympics , artificial turf was installed and it became the home of Montreal 's professional baseball and football teams . The Montreal Alouettes of the CFL returned to their previous home of Molson Stadium in 1998 for regular season games , but continued to use Olympic Stadium for playoff and Grey Cup games until 2014 when they returned to Molson Stadium for all of their games . Following the 2004 baseball season , the Expos relocated to Washington , D.C. , to become the Washington Nationals . The stadium currently serves as a multipurpose facility for special events ( e.g . concerts , trade shows ) with a permanent seating capacity of 56,040 . The capacity is expandable with temporary seating . The Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) use the venue on occasion , when demand for tickets justifies the large capacity or when the weather restricts outdoor play at nearby Saputo Stadium in the spring months .

Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion .

The city is the second-largest in the province , after Saskatoon , and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan . As of the 2016 census , Regina had a city population of 215,106 , and a Metropolitan Area population of 236,481 . It is governed by Regina City Council . The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No . 159 . Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",

Other notable cities include Prince Albert , Moose Jaw , Yorkton , Swift Current , North Battleford , Melfort , and the border city Lloydminster ( partially within Alberta ) . Saskatchewan is a landlocked province with large distances to moderating bodies of waters . As a result , its climate is extremely continental , rendering severe winters throughout the province . Southern areas have very warm or hot summers . Midale and Yellow Grass ( both near the U.S. border ) are tied for the highest ever recorded temperatures in Canada , with 45 \u00b0C ( 113 \u00b0F ) observed at both locations on July 5 , 1937 .

This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 .
