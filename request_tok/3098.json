  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Open_pit": "Open-pit , open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth , such as long wall mining . Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface . It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling ( as would be the case for sand , cinder , and gravel ) . In contrast , minerals that have been found underground but are difficult to retrieve due to hard rock , can be reached using a form of underground mining . To create an open-pit mine , the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground . This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground , then plotting each hole location on a map . The information gained through the holes with provide an idea of the vertical extent of the ore 's body . This vertical information is then used to pit tentative locations of the benches that will occur in the mine . It is important to consider the grade and economic value of the ore in the potential pit . Open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as quarries . Open-pit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted , or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic .",
  "/wiki/Iron": "Iron ( /\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rn/ ) is a chemical element with symbol Fe ( from Latin : ferrum ) and atomic number 26 . It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is by mass the most common element on Earth , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust . In its metallic state , iron is rare in the Earth 's crust , limited to deposition by meteorites . Iron ores , by contrast , are among the most abundant in the Earth 's crust , although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C ( 2,730 \u00b0F ) or higher , about 500 \u00b0C ( 900 \u00b0F ) higher than what is enough to smelt copper . Humans started to master that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE [ not verified in body ] , and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys , in some regions , only around 1200 BCE . That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age . In the modern world , iron alloys , such as steel , inox , cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals , because of their high mechanical properties and low cost . Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray . However , iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust . Unlike the oxides of some other metals , that form passivating layers , rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off , exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion .",
  "/wiki/Jackson,_Michigan": "Jackson is a city in the south central area of the U.S. state of Michigan , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) west of Ann Arbor and 35 miles ( 56 km ) south of Lansing . It is the county seat of Jackson County . As of the 2010 census , the city population was 33,534 , down from 36,316 at the 2000 census . Served by Interstate 94 , it is the principal city of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area , which includes Jackson County and has a population of 160,248 . Founded in 1829 , it was named after President Andrew Jackson . By the late 19th century , it had developed as a railroad hub and was known as the crossroads of Michigan . By 1910 it had strong manufacturing of a variety of automobiles and parts and was also a center of corset manufacturing into the 1920s . As an industrial city , it attracted numerous migrants from the American South , both white and black , and European immigrants who were seeking better economic opportunity . The first state prison was built here . By 1882 it had developed as the largest walled prison in the world , containing both factory facilities and farmland . A new prison was built in 1934 north of the city limits .",
