Only the principal , above the line editor ( s ) as listed in the film 's credits are named on the award ; additional editors , supervising editors , etc . are not currently eligible . The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the Academy ; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012 . The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference ; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees .
