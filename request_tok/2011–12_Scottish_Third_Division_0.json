It is on the north bank of the Forth at the spot where some say it ceases to be the River Forth and becomes the Firth of Forth . Alloa is south of the Ochil Hills , 5.5 miles ( 8.9 km ) east of Stirling and 7.9 miles ( 12.7 km ) north of Falkirk ; by water Alloa is 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Granton . The town , formerly a burgh of barony , is the administrative centre of Clackmannanshire Council . Historically , the economy relied heavily on trade between Glasgow and mainland Europe through its port . This became increasingly uncompetitive and the port stopped operating in 1970 . Any future marina project is likely to focus on tourism with Stirling or Granton rather than importing or exporting goods since downstream ports like Grangemouth can accommodate larger vessels . The local economy is now centred on retail and leisure since the closure of major industries ; only one brewer and one glassmaker survive today . Parochially , Alloa was linked with Tullibody . The towns are now distinct , albeit with Lornshill in the middle , and Alloa is about twice the size of its north-western neighbour . The population of Alloa was estimated to be approximately 20,730 residents in 2016 .",

Cumbernauld was marked by the Romans in antiquity . Traces of this are still visible today for example at Westerwood and , less conspicuously , north of the M80 where the legionaries surfaced what would later be called the Auld Cley Road . This is acknowledged in Cumbernauld Community Park , also site of Scotland 's only visible open-air Roman altar , in the shadow of the imposing Carrickstone Water Tower . For many years Cumbernauld was chiefly populated around what is now called The Village with the medieval castle a short walk away surrounded by its own park grounds . The castle frequently hosted visiting royalty and the grounds were famous for their white cattle which were hunted in the oak forest . The town began to spread as the weaving industry of the village was supplemented by mining and quarrying as travel across Scotland became easier due to the Forth and Clyde Canal and the railways being constructed . Cumbernauld railway station , though some distance from the village , improved communications with Glasgow , Falkirk and Stirling .

The record attendance of 6,000 was set by a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers in 1948 . When Stranraer entered the Scottish Football League in 1955 , a terrace cover was erected , called the Shed . There were no significant further changes until 1981 , when Stair Park became the last ground in league football in either England or Scotland to install floodlights . Stair Park was significantly improved in the 1990s . 300 seats were installed in the Shed , then a new main stand with 1,524 seats was constructed . This cost \u00a3520,000 to build , with the club committee raising \u00a3120,000 of the cost and the rest financed by grants from the Football Trust and the district council . There is not normally segregation at Stranraer matches , but there are 2,000 places for away fans ."
