He was also a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . The son of Otto IV , Count of Wittelsbach , and brother of Otto I of Bavaria , he studied in Salzburg and Paris . At the Council of Lodi in 1161 , Frederick Barbarossa appointed him archbishop of Mainz to end a schism between Rudolf of Z\u00e4hringen and Christian von Buch in that see . At that same council , Barbarossa appointed Victor IV antipope in opposition to Pope Alexander III . After Victor 's death in 1164 , Rainald of Dassel , the archbishop of Cologne , chose as antipope Paschal III at Lucca . Conrad refused to support the new antipope and consequently fell out with Barbarossa . He fled to France and then Rome in 1165 and his see was bestowed on Christian von Buch , though Alexander III still recognised him as legal archbishop . On 18 December , the pope made him cardinal priest of San Marcello al Corso and then cardinal bishop of Sabina . The pope later created him bishop of Sora in Campania .

With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres ( 27,200 sq mi ) , Bavaria is the largest German state by land area comprising roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany . With 13 million inhabitants , it is Germany 's second-most-populous state after North Rhine-Westphalia . Bavaria 's main cities are Munich ( its capital and largest city and also the third largest city in Germany ) , Nuremberg and Augsburg . The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes , followed by the conquests of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC , when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum . It became a stem duchy in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire , became an independent kingdom , joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom , and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 . The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555 . In the 17th century AD , the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire . The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918 , when Bavaria became a republic . In 1946 , the Free State of Bavaria reorganized itself on democratic lines after the Second World War . Bavaria has a unique culture , largely because of the state 's former Catholic majority and conservative traditions",

The Archbishop-Elector was president of the electoral college , arch-chancellor of the empire and primate of Germany until the dissolution of the empire in 1806 . The origin of the title dates back to 747 , when the city of Mainz was made the seat of an archbishop , and a succession of able and ambitious prelates made the district under their rule a strong and vigorous state . Among these men were important figures in the history of Germany such as Hatto I , Siegfried III , Peter of Aspelt , and Albert of Mainz . There were several violent contests between rivals for the archbishopric , and their power struggles occasionally moved the citizens of Mainz to revolt . The lands of the elector lay around the city of Mainz on both banks of the Rhine ; their area reached 3200 sq . m by the end of the Empire .

  "/wiki/External_cardinal": "In the category of the members of the College of Cardinals in the central Middle Ages ( 11th to 13th century ) , an external cardinal ( as opposed to a curial cardinal ) was a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church who did not reside in the Roman Curia , because of simultaneously being a bishop of the episcopal see other than suburbicarian , or abbot of an abbey situated outside Rome . In the wider sense , it may also concern cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees and resigned their memberships in the College of Cardinals with this appointment . As well , it can concern cardinals who were generally curial cardinals , but for some time exercised the posts of administrators or prelates of the external churches . Today , the great majority of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries . Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope , their dignity is purely honorific . However , originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome , constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses ( called suburbicarian sees ) bordering the diocese of Rome ( cardinal-bishops ) , priests of the parochial churches of Rome ( cardinal-priests ) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome ( cardinal-deacons ) . Unlike today , the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses , parochial churches ( called tituli ) or deaconries to which they were attached . The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule , that cardinals - members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome - can not serve simultaneously in another , external church , which is now common practice",

The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal )",
