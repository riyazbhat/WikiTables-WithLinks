As the town grew prosperous , the Romans established the foundations of its castle in the 1st century AD . Kyrenia grew in importance after the 9th century due to the safety offered by the castle , and played a pivotal role under the Lusignan rule as the city never capitulated . The castle has been most recently modified by the Venetians in the 15th century , but the city surrendered to the Ottoman Empire in 1571 . The city 's population was almost equally divided between Muslims and Christians in 1831 , with a slight Muslim majority .
