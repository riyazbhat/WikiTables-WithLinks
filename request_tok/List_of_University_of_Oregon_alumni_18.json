The group 's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson , their cousin Mike Love , and their friend Al Jardine .

The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R & B to create their unique sound , and with Brian as composer , arranger , producer , and de facto leader , they often incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways . The Beach Boys began as a garage band led by Brian and managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry . In 1963 , the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance , dubbed the California Sound . From 1965 , they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and Good Vibrations single raised the group 's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . After scrapping the album Smile in 1967 , Brian 's contributions diminished due to his mental health issues .
