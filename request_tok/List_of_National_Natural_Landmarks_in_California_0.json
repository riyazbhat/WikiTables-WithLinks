  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments , such as either volcanic clinkers , volcanic ash , or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent . The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single , typically cylindrical , vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders , clinkers , or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical ; with slopes between 30-40\u00b0 ; and a nearly circular ground plan . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit .",
  "/wiki/Pahoehoe": "Lava is molten rock generated by geothermal energy and expelled through fractures in planetary crust or in an eruption , usually at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 \u00b0C ( 1,292 to 2,192 \u00b0F ) . The structures resulting from subsequent solidification and cooling are also sometimes described as lava . The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets , including Earth , and some of their satellites , though such material located below the crust is referred to by other terms . A lava flow is a moving outpouring of lava created during a non-explosive effusive eruption . When it has stopped moving , lava solidifies to form igneous rock . The term lava flow is commonly shortened to lava . Although lava can be up to 100,000 times more viscous than water , lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and shear thinning properties . Explosive eruptions produce a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra , rather than lava flows . The word lava comes from Italian , and is probably derived from the Latin word labes which means a fall or slide . The first use in connection with extruded magma ( molten rock below the Earth 's surface ) was apparently in a short account written by Francesco Serao on the eruption of Vesuvius in 1737 . Serao described a flow of fiery lava as an analogy to the flow of water and mud down the flanks of the volcano following heavy rain .",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_66": "U.S. Route 66 or U.S. Highway 66 ( US 66 or Route 66 ) , also known as the Will Rogers Highway , the Main Street of America or the Mother Road , was one of the original highways in the U.S. Highway System . US 66 was established on November 11 , 1926 , with road signs erected the following year . The highway , which became one of the most famous roads in the United States , originally ran from Chicago , Illinois , through Missouri , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , and Arizona before ending in Santa Monica in Los Angeles County , California , covering a total of 2,448 miles ( 3,940 km ) . It was recognized in popular culture by both the hit song ( Get Your Kicks on ) Route 66 and the Route 66 television series , which aired on CBS from 1960 to 1964 . In John Steinbeck 's classic American novel , The Grapes of Wrath ( 1939 ) , the road Highway 66 symbolized escape and loss . US 66 served as a primary route for those who migrated west , especially during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s , and the road supported the economies of the communities through which it passed . People doing business along the route became prosperous due to the growing popularity of the highway , and those same people later fought to keep the highway alive in the face of the growing threat of being bypassed by the new Interstate Highway System . US 66 underwent many improvements and realignments over its lifetime , but was officially removed from the United States Highway System in 1985 after it had been replaced in its entirety by segments of the Interstate Highway System . Portions of the road that passed through Illinois , Missouri , New Mexico , and Arizona have been communally designated a National Scenic Byway by the name Historic Route 66 , returning the name to some maps . Several states have adopted significant bypassed sections of the former US 66 into their state road networks as State Route 66 . The corridor is also being redeveloped into U.S . Bicycle Route 66 , a part of the United States Bicycle Route System that was developed in the 2010s .",

The valley also has many major cities , including the state capital Sacramento ; as well as Chico , Redding , Stockton , Modesto , Fresno , and Bakersfield . The Central Valley watershed comprises 60,000 square miles ( 160,000 km2 ) , or over a third of California . It consists of three main drainage systems : the Sacramento Valley in the north , which receives well over 20 inches ( 510 mm ) of rain annually ; the drier San Joaquin Valley in the south ; and the Tulare Basin and its semi-arid desert climate at the southernmost end . The Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems drain their respective valleys and meet to form the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta , a large expanse of interconnected canals , stream beds , sloughs , marshes , and peat islands . The delta empties into the San Francisco Bay , and then ultimately flows into the Pacific . The waters of the Tulare Basin essentially never flow to the ocean ( with the exception of Kings River waters diverted northward for irrigation ) , though they are connected by man-made canals to the San Joaquin and could drain there again naturally if they were ever to rise high enough .",

  "/wiki/Nassella": "Nassella , or needlegrass , is a New World genus of over 100 perennial bunchgrasses found from North America through South America . The Latin word nassa refers to a basket with a narrow neck . It is usually considered segregate from the genus Stipa and includes many New World species formerly classified in that genus .

The lemma tips are fused into the crown , a short membrane that surrounds the base of the lemma . The rim of the crown usually has hairs . Many species form both cross-pollinating and self-pollinating florets in the terminal panicle . The self-pollinating florets have 1-3 small anthers ; the cross-pollinating florets have 3 longer anthers . Some species have self-pollinating inflorescences hidden in their basal leaf sheaths . These hidden inflorescences lack glumes and usually lack awns .",

It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era . The name is derived from the Latin creta . It is usually abbreviated K , for its German translation Kreide . The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate , resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas . These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles , ammonites and rudists , while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land . During this time , new groups of mammals and birds , as well as flowering plants , appeared . The Cretaceous ( along with the Mesozoic ) ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , a large mass extinction in which many groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , pterosaurs and large marine reptiles died out .

These mounds range in diameter from 3 to more than 50 m ; in height 30 cm to greater than 2 m ; and in density from several to greater than 50 mounds per hectare , at times forming conspicuous natural patterns . Mima mounds can be seen at the Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve in Washington State . Mima is a name derived from a Native American language meaning a little further along or downstream . Theories for the origin of Mima mounds include burrowing by pocket gophers ; accumulation of wind-blown ( aeolian ) sediments around vegetation to form coppice dunes or nebkhas ; seismic ground shaking by major earthquakes , though none have been observed to form Mima mounds ; and shrinking and swelling of clays in hog-wallow or gilgai landforms . Though the definitive Mima mounds are common in North America , it has not been shown that all North American mounds result from the same causes . Superficially similar phenomena occur on all continents , and the proposed causal factors do not occur in all regions that have been studied . Nor is it clear that all such mounds really are the same , either physically or functionally ; for example , the so-called fairy circles of Southern Africa tend to be less mound-like and occur in different climatic and ecological conditions from mima mounds . Furthermore , it has been argued that the possibly distinct heuweltjies of the South Western Cape region of South Africa are of an origin far different from either ."
