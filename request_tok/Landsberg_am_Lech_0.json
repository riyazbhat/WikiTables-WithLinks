  "/wiki/American_Football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one .

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning",
  "/wiki/Softball": "Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball ( 11 to 12 in . circumference ) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet , a pitcher 's mound that ranges from 35-43 feet away from home plate , and a homerun fence that is 220 feet away from home plate . It was invented in 1887 in Chicago , Illinois , United States as an indoor game . The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball . There is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball ; yet , the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base . The name softball was given to the game in 1932 , because the ball used to be soft ; however , in modern-day usage , the balls are hard . A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World 's Fair spurred interest in the game . The Amateur Softball Association ( ASA ) of America ( founded 1933 ) is one of the largest governing bodies for the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships . Other national and regional governing bodies also exist , including the USSSA . The World Baseball Softball Confederation ( WBSC ) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries , including the United States and Canada ; before the WBSC was formed in 2013 , the International Softball Federation filled this role . Women 's fast pitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996 , but it and baseball were dropped from the 2012 program ; they are to be reinstated in 2020 . There are three types of softball",
  "/wiki/Dance": "Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement . This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value , and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture . [ nb 1 ] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements , or by its historical period or place of origin . An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance , although these two categories are not always completely separate ; both may have special functions , whether social , ceremonial , competitive , erotic , martial , or sacred/liturgical . Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality , including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , synchronised swimming , marching bands , and many other forms of athletics"
