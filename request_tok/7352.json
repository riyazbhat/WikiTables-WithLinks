  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",

Typically , a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with their stick towards the goal net opening , and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against their team . The term goal may also refer to the structure in which goals are scored . The ice hockey goal is rectangular in shape ; the front frame of the goal is made of steel tube painted red ( blue in the ECHL because of a sponsorship deal with the Government Employees Insurance Company ) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar . A net is attached to the back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind . The entire goal is considered an inbounds area of the playing surface , and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal . Under NHL rules , the opening of the goal is 72 inches ( 180 cm ) wide by 48 inches ( 120 cm ) tall , and the footprint of the goal is 40 inches ( 100 cm ) deep .",

In ice hockey and lacrosse , its a statistic that represents the percentage of shots on goal a goaltender stops . It is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal . Although the statistic is called save percentage , it is given as a decimal ( in the same way as an on-base percentage in baseball ) . Thus , .933 means a goaltender saved 93.3 percent of all shots they faced . National Hockey League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .900 , and National Lacrosse League goaltenders typically have a save percentage above .750 . In ice hockey internationally , a save percentage is expressed as a true percentage ( e.g . 90 % ) , not a decimal . Save percentage applies in an analogous way to goalkeepers in association football . Save percentage in baseball applies to relief pitchers , particularly closers .
