Sinclair also owns four digital multicast networks ( Comet , Charge ! , Stadium , and TBD ) , sports-oriented cable networks ( Tennis Channel and Fox Sports Networks ) , and a streaming service ( Stirr ) , and owns or operates four radio stations in the Pacific Northwest . Among other non-broadcast properties , Sinclair also owns the professional wrestling promotion Ring of Honor and its streaming service Honor Club . Sinclair has faced scrutiny from some media critics , as well as some of its station employees , for the conservative slant of their stations ' news reporting and other programming decisions , and how the company 's rapid growth has aided the airing of content that supports these views . Sinclair has also faced criticism over business practices that circumvent concentration of media ownership regulations , particularly the use of local marketing agreements , accusations that the company had been currying favor with the Trump administration in order to loosen these rules and about its management lacking diversity and being totally controlled by a single family . Critics including former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather have described Sinclair 's practices as being an assault on our democracy by disseminating what they perceive to be Orwellian-like propaganda to its local stations .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

  "/wiki/Adult_Standards": "Adult standards is a North American radio format heard primarily on AM or class A FM stations . Adult standards ( also sometimes known as the nostalgia format ) is aimed at mature adults , meaning mainly those persons over 50 years of age , but it is mostly targeted for senior citizens . It is primarily on AM because market research reveals that only persons in that age group listen to music on AM in sizable numbers . Adult standards first became a popular format in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a way to reach mature adults who came of age before the rock era but were perhaps too mature for adult contemporary radio or too young for beautiful music or MOR stations . A typical adult standards playlist includes traditional pop music by artists such as Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett , some easy listening numbers from Roger Whittaker and others , and softer tunes from the oldies and adult contemporary formats ; as originally conceived , the format also features big band music , particularly from the 1940s and 1950s , though most modern stations eschew that genre . Younger artists who record in the big-band era style , such as Harry Connick , Jr. , or Diana Krall , may be played as well . The term standards in the format 's title is a reference to the standard , a song that is covered extensively by many artists over a prolonged period of time ; adult standards may play true standards but are not limited to them . At one time there were several hundred such stations , a number that has declined to approximately 200 as of 2012 . Because the adult standards audience has increased in age to the point where many of its listeners have either died or are no longer attractive to advertisers , the format as it is known today ( much like the contemporary decline of oldies and smooth jazz formats , along with the earlier demise of easy listening ) is likely to die out . Most independently programmed former adult standards stations have transitioned to other formats such as oldies , classic hits , or adult contemporary music that have similar music but skew toward more modern songs .",
