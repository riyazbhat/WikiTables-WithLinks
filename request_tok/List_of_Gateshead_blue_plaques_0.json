According to the 2001 UK census it had a population of 5,051 . Historically part of Gateshead Fell in County Durham , Sheriff Hill was the site of a battle between William the Conqueror and Malcolm III of Scotland in 1068 . A road was built through Gateshead Fell in the early 13th century , attracting some settlers . A procession of bishops , sheriffs and noblemen known as the Sheriff 's March took place on the road in 1282 and continued biannually until the 1830s . By then , Gateshead Fell had been enclosed and a village had grown around the road , largely populated by an influx of tinkers , coalminers working at Sheriff Hill Colliery and workers at the local pottery , mill and sandstone quarry . By the turn of the 20th century these industries were in steep decline . The local authority built a large council estate at Sheriff Hill to alleviate dangerous overcrowding in Gateshead , effectively turning the area into a residential suburb . It ceased to be an independent village on 1 April 1974 when it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972 . Now part of the local council ward of High Fell , the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared with other areas of the borough and nationally , with high levels of unemployment . Sheriff Hill was the site of one of Gateshead 's largest boarding schools but as of 2012 , the only remaining educational establishment is Glynwood Primary School",

  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people",

  "/wiki/Photographic_paper": "Photographic paper is a paper coated with a light-sensitive chemical formula , used for making photographic prints . When photographic paper is exposed to light , it captures a latent image that is then developed to form a visible image ; with most papers the image density from exposure can be sufficient to not require further development , aside from fixing and clearing , though latent exposure is also usually present . The light-sensitive layer of the paper is called the emulsion . The most common chemistry was based on silver salts ( the focus of this page ) but other alternatives have also been used . The print image is traditionally produced by interposing a photographic negative between the light source and the paper , either by direct contact with a large negative ( forming a contact print ) or by projecting the shadow of the negative onto the paper ( producing an enlargement ) . The initial light exposure is carefully controlled to produce a gray scale image on the paper with appropriate contrast and gradation . Photographic paper may also be exposed to light using digital printers such as the LightJet , with a camera ( to produce a photographic negative ) , by scanning a modulated light source over the paper , or by placing objects upon it ( to produce a photogram ) . Despite the introduction of digital photography , photographic papers are still sold commercially .

By extension , it is also sung at funerals , graduations , and as a farewell or ending to other occasions . The international Scouting movement in many countries uses it to close jamborees and other functions . The poem 's Scots title may be translated into standard English as old long since or , more idiomatically , long long ago , days gone by , or old times . Consequently , For auld lang syne , as it appears in the first line of the chorus , might be loosely translated as for the sake of old times . The phrase Auld Lang Syne is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton ( 1570-1638 ) , Allan Ramsay ( 1686-1757 ) , and James Watson ( 1711 ) , as well as older folk songs predating Burns . Matthew Fitt uses the phrase in the days of auld lang syne as the equivalent of once upon a time in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language",

  "/wiki/Suffragette": "A suffragette was a member of militant women 's organisations in the early 20th century who , under the banner Votes for Women , fought for the right to vote in public elections , known as women 's suffrage . The term refers in particular to members of the British Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , a women-only movement founded in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst , which engaged in direct action and civil disobedience . In 1906 , a reporter writing in the Daily Mail coined the term suffragette for the WSPU , from suffragist , to belittle the women advocating women 's suffrage . The militants embraced the new name , even adopting it for use as the title of the newspaper published by the WSPU . Women had won the right to vote in several countries by the end of the 19th century ; in 1893 , New Zealand became the first self-governing country to grant the vote to all women over the age of 21 . When by 1903 women in Britain had not been enfranchised , Pankhurst decided that women had to do the work ourselves ; the WSPU motto became deeds , not words . The suffragettes heckled politicians , tried to storm parliament , were attacked and sexually assaulted during battles with the police , chained themselves to railings , smashed windows , set fire to postboxes and empty buildings , set bombs in order to damage churches and property , and faced anger and ridicule in the media . When imprisoned they went on hunger strike , to which the government responded by force-feeding them . The first suffragette to be force fed was Evaline Hilda Burkitt . The death of one suffragette , Emily Davison , when she ran in front of the king 's horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby , made headlines around the world . The WSPU campaign had varying levels of support from within the suffragette movement ; breakaway groups formed , and within the WSPU itself not all members supported the direct action . The suffragette campaign was suspended when World War I broke out in 1914",
  "/wiki/Fabian_Society": "The Fabian Society is a British socialist organisation whose purpose is to advance the principles of democratic socialism via gradualist and reformist effort in democracies , rather than by revolutionary overthrow . As one of the founding organisations of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900 , and as an important influence upon the Labour Party which grew from it , the Fabian Society has had a powerful influence on British politics . Other members of the Fabian Society have included political leaders from countries formerly part of the British Empire , such as Jawaharlal Nehru , who adopted Fabian principles as part of their own political ideologies . The Fabian Society founded the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1895 . Today , the society functions primarily as a think tank and is one of 21 socialist societies affiliated with the Labour Party . Similar societies exist in Australia ( the Australian Fabian Society ) , in Canada ( the Douglas-Coldwell Foundation and the now disbanded League for Social Reconstruction ) , in Sicily ( Sicilian Fabian Society ) and in New Zealand ( The NZ Fabian Society )",

  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis",

As a result of the First World War ( 1914-1918 ) , the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell , while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent . In 1917 , George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor , which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment . In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate , independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations .

However , the Army 's doctrine is otherwise typical of holiness churches in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition . The Army 's purposes are the advancement of the Christian religion . of education , the relief of poverty , and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole . The Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist circuit-preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission , and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern .
