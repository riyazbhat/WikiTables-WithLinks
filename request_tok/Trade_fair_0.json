  "/wiki/Agriculture": "Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock . Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago . Pigs , sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago . Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first . Modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased yields , while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage . Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . Environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . Genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber ) .",

Rockhampton is one of the oldest cities in Queensland and in Northern Australia . In 1853 , Charles and William Archer came across what is now also known as the Fitzroy River , which they named in honour of Sir Charles FitzRoy . The Archer brothers took up a run near Gracemere in 1855 , and more settlers arrived soon after , enticed by the fertile valleys . The town of Rockhampton was proclaimed in 1858 , and surveyed by Arthur F Wood and Francis Clarke , the chosen street design closely resembled the Hoddle Grid in Melbourne and consisted of a grid of wide boulevards and laneways , which was uncommon in Queensland . Within the year , gold was found at Canoona , and led to the first North Australian gold rush . This led to an influx of migrants who quickly transformed Rockhampton into the second-largest port in the state ; during this period , Rockhampton was nicknamed as the City of the Three S 's , of which were Sin , Sweat , and Sorrow . Subsequent gold rushes at Mount Morgan Mine , which was at the time one of the most productive gold mines in the world , laid the foundations for much of the city 's Victorian architecture .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland .

The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

  "/wiki/Music": "Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time . General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch ( which governs melody and harmony ) , rhythm ( and its associated concepts tempo , meter , and articulation ) , dynamics ( loudness and softness ) , and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture ( which are sometimes termed the color of a musical sound ) . Different styles or types of music may emphasize , de-emphasize or omit some of these elements . Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping ; there are solely instrumental pieces , solely vocal pieces ( such as songs without instrumental accompaniment ) and pieces that combine singing and instruments . The word derives from Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike ; art of the Muses ) . See glossary of musical terminology . In its most general form , the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music ( songs , tunes , symphonies , and so on ) , the criticism of music , the study of the history of music , and the aesthetic examination of music . Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies . Common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to . However , 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music , saying , for example , There is no noise , only sound . The creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context . Indeed , throughout history , some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as not being music , including Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825 , early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s .",

  "/wiki/Boats": "A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes , but generally smaller than a ship , which is distinguished by its larger size , shape , cargo or passenger capacity , or its ability to carry boats . Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes , or in protected coastal areas . However , some boats , such as the whaleboat , were intended for use in an offshore environment . In modern naval terms , a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship . Anomalous definitions exist , as lake freighters 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) long on the Great Lakes are called boats . Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose , available materials , or local traditions . Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation , fishing , and sport . Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions . Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats , pontoon boats , and sailboats . House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence . Lighters are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore . Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions .",

  "/wiki/Books": "A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images , typically composed of many pages ( made of papyrus , parchment , vellum , or paper ) bound together and protected by a cover . The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex ( plural , codices ) . In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records , the codex replaces its immediate predecessor , the scroll . A single sheet in a codex is a leaf , and each side of a leaf is a page . As an intellectual object , a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable , though not so extensive , investment of time to read . This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense . In the restricted sense , a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition , a usage that reflects the fact that , in antiquity , long works had to be written on several scrolls , and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained . So , for instance , each part of Aristotle 's Physics is called a book . In the unrestricted sense , a book is the compositional whole of which such sections , whether called books or chapters or parts , are parts . The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition , nor even be called a book . Books can consist only of drawings , engravings , or photographs , or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls . In a physical book , the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for ongoing entries , e.g. , an account book , an appointment book , an autograph book , a notebook , a diary , or a sketchbook .",

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata , on the South American continent 's southeastern coast . Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs , but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century , by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre , named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia . The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas , with a population of around 15.6 million . The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ( Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires ; CABA ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; previously , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic . Buenos Aires ' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world in 2018 , being one of the best in Latin America . In 2012 , it was the most visited city in South America , and the second-most visited city of Latin America ( behind Mexico City ) .",

Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt , as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area . Located near the Nile Delta , Cairo was founded in 969 AD by the Fatimid dynasty , but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo . Cairo has long been a centre of the region 's political and cultural life , and is titled the city of a thousand minarets for its preponderance of Islamic architecture . Cairo is considered a World City with a Beta + classification according to GaWC . Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the Arab world , as well as the world 's second-oldest institution of higher learning , Al-Azhar University .

Recent estimates of Kolkata Metropolitan Area 's economy have ranged from $ 60 to $ 150 billion ( GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity ) making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India , after Mumbai and Delhi . In the late 17th century , the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty . After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690 , the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post . Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi . Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement ; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics .",

  "/wiki/Video_game": "A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen , virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set . Since the 1980s , video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry , and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute . The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others . Specialized platforms such as arcade games , which present the game in a large , typically coin-operated chassis , were common in the 1980s in video arcades , but declined in popularity as other , more affordable platforms became available . These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles , as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop , desktop or handheld computing devices . The input device used for games , the game controller , varies across platforms . Common controllers include gamepads , joysticks , mouse devices , keyboards , the touchscreens of mobile devices , or even a person 's body , using a Kinect sensor . Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles . There are often game sound effects , music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones . Some games in the 2000s include haptic , vibration-creating effects , force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets . Since the 2010s , the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing .",
