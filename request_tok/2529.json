It exists in equilibrium with a tautomer CH3C ( O ) CH=C ( OH ) CH3 . These tautomers interconvert so rapidly under most conditions that they are treated as a single compound in most applications . It is a colorless liquid that is a precursor to acetylacetonate anion ( commonly abbreviated acac\u2212 ) , a bidentate ligand . It is also a building block for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds .",
  "/wiki/Alkene": "In organic chemistry , an alkene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon that contains a carbon-carbon double bond ( unsaturated hydrocarbons containing two or more double bonds and are known as alkadienes , alkatrienes , alkatetraenes , and so on , the suffix denoting the number of double bonds ) . The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably ( see nomenclature section below ) . Acyclic alkenes , with only one double bond and no other functional groups , known as mono-enes , form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n . Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane ( with the same number of carbon atoms ) . The simplest alkene , ethylene ( C2H4 ) , with the IUPAC name ethene , is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially . Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes , but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes .",
  "/wiki/Benzene": "Benzene is an organic chemical compound with the molecular formula C6H6 . The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each . As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms , benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon . Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil and is one of the elementary petrochemicals . Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms , benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon , the second [ n ] -annulene ( -annulene ) . It is sometimes abbreviated PhH . Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell , and is responsible for the aroma around petrol ( gasoline ) stations . It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure , such as ethylbenzene and cumene , of which billions of kilograms are produced annually . As benzene has a high octane number , aromatic derivatives like toluene and xylene typically comprise up to 25 % of gasoline ( petrol ) . Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1 % in gasoline because it is a known human carcinogen . Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason .",
  "/wiki/1,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane": "1,2-Bis ( diphenylphosphino ) ethane ( dppe ) is an organophosphorus compound with the formula ( Ph2PCH2 ) 2 ( Ph = phenyl ) . It is a commonly used bidentate ligand in coordination chemistry . It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents .",

  "/wiki/Crown_ether": "Crown ethers are cyclic chemical compounds that consist of a ring containing several ether groups . The most common crown ethers are cyclic oligomers of ethylene oxide , the repeating unit being ethyleneoxy , i.e. , -CH2CH2O- . Important members of this series are the tetramer ( n = 4 ) , the pentamer ( n = 5 ) , and the hexamer ( n = 6 ) . The term crown refers to the resemblance between the structure of a crown ether bound to a cation , and a crown sitting on a person 's head . The first number in a crown ether 's name refers to the number of atoms in the cycle , and the second number refers to the number of those atoms that are oxygen . Crown ethers are much broader than the oligomers of ethylene oxide ; an important group are derived from catechol . Crown ethers strongly bind certain cations , forming complexes . The oxygen atoms are well situated to coordinate with a cation located at the interior of the ring , whereas the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic . The resulting cations often form salts that are soluble in nonpolar solvents , and for this reason crown ethers are useful in phase transfer catalysis . The denticity of the polyether influences the affinity of the crown ether for various cations . For example , 18-crown-6 has high affinity for potassium cation , 15-crown-5 for sodium cation , and 12-crown-4 for lithium cation . The high affinity of 18-crown-6 for potassium ions contributes to its toxicity .",
  "/wiki/Cryptate": "Cryptands are a family of synthetic bicyclic and polycyclic multidentate ligands for a variety of cations . The Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1987 was given to Donald J. Cram , Jean-Marie Lehn , and Charles J. Pedersen for their efforts in discovering and determining uses of cryptands and crown ethers , thus launching the now flourishing field of supramolecular chemistry . The term cryptand implies that this ligand binds substrates in a crypt , interring the guest as in a burial . These molecules are three-dimensional analogues of crown ethers but are more selective and strong as complexes for the guest ions . The resulting complexes are lipophilic .",
  "/wiki/Cyclopentadienyl_complex": "A cyclopentadienyl complex is a metal complex with one or more cyclopentadienyl groups ( C5H\u22125 , abbreviated as Cp\u2212 ) . Cyclopentadienyl ligands almost invariable bind to metals as pentahapto ( \u03b75- ) bonding mode . The metal-cyclopentadienyl interaction is typically drawn as a single line from the metal center to the center of the Cp ring .",

Its coordination complexes are of theoretical interest as models for enzymes and as catalysts . Many related ligands can be prepared from other diketones , e.g . benzil .",
  "/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid": "Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , also known by several other names , is a chemical used for both industrial and medical purposes . It was synthesized for the first time in 1935 by Ferdinand M\u00fcnz . It is an aminopolycarboxylic acid and a colorless , water-soluble solid . Its conjugate base is ethylenediaminetetraacetate . It is widely used to dissolve limescale . Its usefulness arises because of its role as a hexadentate ( six-toothed ) ligand and chelating agent , i.e. , its ability to sequester metal ions such as Ca2+ and Fe3+ . After being bound by EDTA into a metal complex , metal ions remain in solution but exhibit diminished reactivity . EDTA is produced as several salts , notably disodium EDTA , calcium disodium EDTA , and tetrasodium EDTA ( typically as the hydrate ) .",
  "/wiki/EGTA_(chemical)": "EGTA ( ethylene glycol-bis ( \u03b2-aminoethyl ether ) -N , N , N\u2032 , N\u2032-tetraacetic acid ) , also known as egtazic acid ( INN , USAN ) , is an aminopolycarboxylic acid , a chelating agent . It is a colourless solid that is related to the better known EDTA . Compared to EDTA , it has a lower affinity for magnesium , making it more selective for calcium ions . It is useful in buffer solutions that resemble the environment in living cells where calcium ions are usually at least a thousandfold less concentrated than magnesium . The pKa for binding of calcium ions by tetrabasic EGTA is 11.00 , but the protonated forms do not significantly contribute to binding , so at pH 7 , the apparent pKa becomes 6.91 . See Qin et al . for an example of a pKa calculation . EGTA has also been used experimentally for the treatment of animals with cerium poisoning and for the separation of thorium from the mineral monazite . EGTA is used as a compound in elution buffer in the protein purification technique known as tandem affinity purification , in which recombinant fusion proteins are bound to calmodulin beads and eluted out by adding EGTA . EGTA is often employed in dentistry and endodontics for the removal of the smear layer ."
