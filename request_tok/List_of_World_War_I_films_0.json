The eldest grandchild of Queen Victoria , Wilhelm 's first cousins included King George V of the United Kingdom and many princesses who , along with Wilhelm 's sister Sophia , became European consorts . For most of his life before becoming emperor , he was second in line to succeed his grandfather Wilhelm I on the German and Prussian thrones after his father , Crown Prince Frederick . His grandfather and father both died in 1888 , the Year of Three Emperors , making Wilhelm emperor and king . He dismissed the country 's longtime chancellor , Otto von Bismarck , in 1890 . Upon consolidating power as emperor , Wilhelm launched Germany on a bellicose New Course to cement its status as a respected world power . However , he frequently undermined this aim by making tactless , alarming public statements without consulting his ministers . He also did much to alienate his country from the other Great Powers by initiating a massive build-up of the German Navy , challenging French control over Morocco , and backing the Austrian annexation of Bosnia in 1908 . His turbulent reign ultimately culminated in his guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the crisis of July 1914 , resulting in the outbreak of World War I . A lax wartime leader , he left virtually all decision-making regarding military strategy and organisation of the war effort in the hands of the German General Staff . This broad delegation of authority gave rise to a de facto military dictatorship whose belligerent foreign policy led to the United States ' entry into the war on 6 April 1917",
