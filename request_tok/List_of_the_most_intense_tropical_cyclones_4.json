  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales , according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin ( s ) they are located in . Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones , but some alternative scales also exist , such as accumulated cyclone energy , the Power Dissipation Index , the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index , and the Hurricane Severity Index . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales . Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms . Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane , then it will be classified on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale , which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period . In the Western Pacific , the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin , which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period . The India Meteorological Department 's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean , and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales , which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds : The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin . The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories , including New Caledonia and French Polynesia . The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m ( 33 ft ) . However , the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period , at 10 m ( 33 ft ) above the surface . The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period , and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval .",

The season was fairly active , lasting from October to May . There were nine named storms that attained gale-force winds , or at least 65 km/h ( 40 mph ) . Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status , which have 10 minute sustained winds of at least 120 km/h ( 75 mph ) . The first storm was Tropical Cyclone Alex , which was named by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) . this was due to the boundary of the basin at the time , which incorporated the Indian Ocean south of the equator and extended from the east coast of Africa to 80\u00b0 E ; the eastern extent was later moved to 90\u00b0 E. Two other storms - Armelle and Damia - also originated in the Australian basin . The latter was the strongest cyclone on record in the basin at the time by barometric pressure , estimated at 898 mbar ( 26.5 inHg ) . The first storm to affect Madagascar was Benedicte in December , and was followed by tropical storms Frida and Electre in February and Justine in March . The final storm of the season was Cyclone Karla , which remained in the eastern periphery of the basin while reaching winds of 170 km/h ( 105 mph ) .",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Geralda": "Cyclone Geralda ( also known as Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda ) was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994 , among the strongest to hit the country . It originated from an area of low pressure over the Indian Ocean on January 25 . Over the following few days , the depression underwent gradual intensification , reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200 km/h ( 125 mph ) on January 31 . Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina , Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity . Within hours of moving onshore , the system had substantially weakened , and by February 5 , Geralda had degenerated into a land depression , and it became extratropical three days later . Geralda was the second cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar , after Daisy in January . Geralda produced wind gusts as strong as 350 km/h ( 220 mph ) , which were the highest worldwide for several decades . The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding , particularly in valleys . About 80% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed , including most schools , homes , and churches . The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines , which later disrupted relief efforts . In the capital Antananarivo , Geralda killed 43 people after flooding many houses .

The first named storm was Albertine , which formed on November 23 in the northeastern portion of the basin and became one of three intense tropical cyclones . The last storm was Marlene , which was also an intense tropical cyclone and dissipated on April 11 . Most of the storms originated from the intertropical convergence zone . In late December into early January , tropical storms Bentha and Christelle persisted to the east of Madagascar , undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with each other . Later in January , Dorina became the second of three intense tropical cyclones , but weakened before passing near Rodrigues . Tropical Depression Eliceca and Tropical Storm Fodah both formed in the Mozambique Channel toward the end of January , bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the region . In February , Gail produced gusty winds on Rodrigues , and Tropical Storm Heida entered the basin from Australian region . Later in the month , Ingrid brought strong winds to Mauritius .

Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone , Bonita bypassed Mauritius and R\u00e9union to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10 . There , the storm affected up to 150,000 people , flooded wide tracts of croplands , and killed 25 people . In the aftermath , disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community , as well as non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) ; the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $ 450,000 in monetary donations . Bonita emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a significantly diminished storm , though it quickly regained some of its previous intensity . Three days after its initial landfall , the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique . Throughout northern parts of the country , Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals . Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges , isolating some locations . A meteorological rarity , Bonita continued inland for several days , persisting as a distinct tropical low ; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean .

The first storm , Intense Tropical Cyclone Agnielle , formed in the adjacent Australian basin on November 16 and later reached peak winds in the south-west Indian Ocean . The next named storm after Agnielle was Bonita , which formed in early January and killed 42 people . The basin was most active in February , with two tropical cyclones , or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , as well as a severe tropical storm . The first of these three was Doloresse , which killed 67 people due to a shipwreck in the Comoros . The next storm was Cyclone Edwige , which caused heavy crop damage on Mauritius before looping along the east coast of Madagascar . In March , both Cyclone Flossy and Tropical Storm Guylianne passed near the Mascarene Islands , producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds . Tropical activity continued through April and May , with two tropical cyclones in the former month . In early April , Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues , dropping more rainfall in 24 hours than the average monthly total . Later , Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone , but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island . The final storm of the season , Jenna , formed in the Australian region , briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean , and proceeded to exit the basin on May 4 to end the season .",

It was the last in a series of three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year . Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March 22 , within the Australian region cyclone basin . Moving westward as the result of a strong subtropical ridge to its south , the storm quickly intensified , and reached Category 2 cyclone intensity on March 25 before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin . For various reasons that remain unknown , the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in R\u00e9union . Nonetheless , M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France ( MFR ) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone . An eye formed , and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on March 27 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia . On April 1 , the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone , estimating peak 10 minute winds of 225 km/h ( 140 mph ) . By contrast , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated 1 minute winds of 235 km/h ( 145 mph ) . Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha , Madagascar on April 2 . It weakened greatly over land , but re-attained tropical cyclone status on April 5 after moving over the Mozambique Channel . Hudah reached 10 minute winds of 160 km/h ( 100 mph ) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane , Mozambique , on April 8 , and dissipated by the next day .",

By January 17 , the system had developed enough organized convection as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression . Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter , with the system attaining winds in excess of 120 km/h ( 75 mph ) on January 18 . Dina achieved its peak intensity on January 20 as an intense tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h ( 130 mph ) . Hours after reaching hits strength , the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about 150 km ( 93 mi ) to its north . On January 21 , the storm brushed Mauritius and R\u00e9union as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward . Once on a southward course , steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January 25 . The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were last noted on January 28 before being absorbed into a polar trough . Across Mauritius and R\u00e9union , torrential rains and destructive winds from the cyclone resulted in extensive to catastrophic damage .

With favorable conditions , Hary quickly intensified on March 7 , developing an eye and well-defined outflow . After reaching an initial peak , the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle , by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar . Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220 km/h ( 140 mph ) on March 10 just offshore eastern Madagascar , which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000 . After peaking , Hary weakened due to land interaction , and it struck Madagascar southeast of Antalaha . It was turning south over land , and as a result it quickly moved offshore . There were three deaths in the country , one of which from electrocution . There was locally heavy crop damage , and four bridges were destroyed . However , the damage was considered minimal , given the intensity of the storm . After affecting Madagascar , Hary accelerated to the southeast , and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over R\u00e9union .

In this basin which officially runs from 30 to 90E and is to the south of the equator , the main warning center is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on La Reunion Island ; however they delegate the naming of Cyclones to the Meteorological services of Mauritius and Madagascar . It was predicted by the Mauritius Meteorological service that there would be between nine and eleven named storms in the South West Indian Ocean during the season . Their further assessment that there was a good probability of a named storm forming in November was justified when Tropical Cyclone Anja formed on November 14 .",

The season officially began on July 1 , 2013 , though the first tropical system designated by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France was a short-lived tropical disturbance that developed on July 8 . However , the first named storm was Cyclone Amara in December . Bruce was the first very intense tropical cyclone since Edzani in 2010 , which originated from the Australian region . The strongest system of the cyclone season was Hellen , also one of the most intense tropical cyclones over the Mozambique Channel .

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Hellen": "Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hellen of March 2014 was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones in the Mozambique Channel on record , as well as the most intense of the 2013-14 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season . Hellen formed on March 26 in the northern portion of the channel , and the storm brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique while in its formative stages . While moving southeastward , it developed an organized area of convection over the center of circulation . Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros , with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms . The cyclone attained peak intensity March 30 , with maximum sustained winds estimated 230 km/h ( 145 mph ) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center , M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in La R\u00e9union . Subsequently , Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and land interaction with Madagascar , and the storm 's eye dissipated . On March 31 , the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone , despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water . By April 1 , Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated . The remnants turned to the west , moving over Mozambique without redeveloping , later dissipating on April 5 . Early in its existence , Hellen 's rainfall in Mozambique destroyed hundreds of houses and a bridge . Flooding killed four people in the country , three of whom due to a home collapsing . Later , the cyclone passed south of the Comoros islands , causing flooding due to high storm surge and waves that killed one person ."
