  "/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number": "The International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique . [ a ] [ b ] Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency . An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation ( except reprintings ) of a publication . For example , an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN . The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 , and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007 . The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries , often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country . The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 , based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966 . The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 ( the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit ' 0 ' ) . Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN . The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative . Another identifier , the International Standard Serial Number ( ISSN ) , identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers . The International Standard Music Number ( ISMN ) covers musical scores .",
