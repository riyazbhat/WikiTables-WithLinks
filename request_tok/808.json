  "/wiki/Season_(sports)": "In an organized sports league , a typical season is the portion of one year in which regulated games of the sport are in session : for example , in Major League Baseball the season lasts approximately from the last week of March to the last week of September . In other team sports , like association football or basketball , it is generally from August or September to May although in some countries - such as Northern Europe or East Asia - the season starts in the spring and finishes in autumn , mainly due to weather conditions encountered during the winter . A year can often be broken up into several distinct sections ( sometimes themselves called seasons ) . These are : a preseason , a series of exhibition games played for training purposes ; a regular season , the main period of the league 's competition ; the postseason , a playoff tournament played against the league 's top teams to determine the league 's champion ; and the offseason , the time when there is no official competition .",

  "/wiki/Campbell_Conference": "The Western Conference ( French : Conf\u00e9rence de l'Ouest ) is one of two conferences in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) used to divide teams . Its counterpart is the Eastern Conference . Previously known as the Clarence Campbell Conference ( or Campbell Conference for short ) , it was created in 1974 when the NHL realigned its teams into two conferences and four divisions . Because the new conferences and divisions had little to do with North American geography , geographical references were removed . The conferences and divisions were re-aligned in 1981 to better reflect the geographical locations of the teams , but the existing names were retained with the Campbell Conference becoming the conference for the NHL 's westernmost teams . The names of conferences and divisions were changed in 1993 to reflect their geographic locations . Then-new NHL commissioner Gary Bettman made the change to help non-hockey fans better understand the game , as the National Basketball Association , National Football League , and Major League Baseball all use geographic-based names for their conferences and divisions . However , the trophy awarded to the conference champion , the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl , retains some connection to the heritage of the league . In 2005 , following the lockout , the league changed the Western Conference logo ( along with the Eastern Conference and NHL logos ) to its current form .",

Only two players , Mario Lemieux and Teemu Selanne , reached the 100-point plateau during the regular season ( compared with 12 who reached the plateau in 1995-96 ) . Many factors , including fewer power plays , more calls of the skate-in-the-crease rule , fewer shots on goal and more injuries to star players than the season before , contributed to the reduction in scoring and skyrocketing in shutouts . Paradoxically , teams averaged more even-strength goals scored ( 174 ) than in 1995-96 ( 172 ) . This was the first time in 30 years - and in the entire expansion era - that the Boston Bruins had a losing record and missed the playoffs , ending a still-unsurpassed North American professional sports streak of 29-straight seasons in the playoffs .",
