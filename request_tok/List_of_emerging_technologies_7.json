  "/wiki/Airborne_wind_turbine": "An airborne wind turbine is a design concept for a wind turbine with a rotor supported in the air without a tower , thus benefiting from more mechanical and aerodynamic options , the higher velocity and persistence of wind at high altitudes , while avoiding the expense of tower construction , or the need for slip rings or yaw mechanism . An electrical generator may be on the ground or airborne . Challenges include safely suspending and maintaining turbines hundreds of meters off the ground in high winds and storms , transferring the harvested and/or generated power back to earth , and interference with aviation . Airborne wind turbines may operate in low or high altitudes ; they are part of a wider class of Airborne Wind Energy Systems ( AWES ) addressed by high-altitude wind power and crosswind kite power . When the generator is on the ground , then the tethered aircraft need not carry the generator mass or have a conductive tether . When the generator is aloft , then a conductive tether would be used to transmit energy to the ground or used aloft or beamed to receivers using microwave or laser . Kites and helicopters come down when there is insufficient wind ; kytoons and blimps may resolve the matter with other disadvantages . Also , bad weather such as lightning or thunderstorms , could temporarily suspend use of the machines , probably requiring them to be brought back down to the ground and covered . Some schemes require a long power cable and , if the turbine is high enough , a prohibited airspace zone . As of July 2015 , no commercial airborne wind turbines are in regular operation .",
  "/wiki/Americium": "Americium is a synthetic radioactive chemical element with the symbol Am and atomic number 95 . It is a transuranic member of the actinide series , in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium , and thus by analogy was named after the Americas . Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley , California , at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago , a part of the Manhattan Project . Although it is the third element in the transuranic series , it was discovered fourth , after the heavier curium . The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945 . Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors - one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100 grams of americium . It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors , as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges . Several unusual applications , such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion , have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm , but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer . Americium is a relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance . Its common isotopes are 241Am and 243Am . In chemical compounds , americium usually assumes the oxidation state +3 , especially in solutions . Several other oxidation states are known , ranging from +2 to +7 , and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra .",
  "/wiki/Artificial_photosynthesis": "Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that biomimics the natural process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight , water , and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen . The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel ( a solar fuel ) . Photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis . Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied that replicates natural carbon fixation . Research of this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels , photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells , and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight .",
  "/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power": "Concentrated solar power ( CSP , also known as concentrating solar power , concentrated solar thermal ) systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a receiver . Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat ( solar thermal energy ) , which drives a heat engine ( usually a steam turbine ) connected to an electrical power generator or powers a thermochemical reaction . CSP had a global total installed capacity of 5,500 MW in 2018 , up from 354 MW in 2005 . Spain accounted for almost half of the world 's capacity , at 2,300 MW , despite no new capacity entering commercial operation in the country since 2013 . The United States follows with 1,740 MW . Interest is also notable in North Africa and the Middle East , as well as India and China . The global market was initially dominated by parabolic-trough plants , which accounted for 90% of CSP plants at one point . Since about 2010 , central power tower CSP has been favored in new plants due to its higher temperature operation ( up to 565 C ) than trough ( up to 400 C ) , which promises greater efficiency . Among the larger CSP projects are the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility ( 392 MW ) in the United States which uses solar power tower technology without thermal energy storage . In the MENA region , the Ouarzazate Solar Power Station came online in Morocco in 2017 It combines trough and tower in three sections for a total of 510 MW with several hours of energy storage . Morocco began its second large CSP project at Midelt as of mid 2019 , at 800 MW , with 5 hours of thermal energy storage daily , and combining trough CSP and PV It was bid in mid-2019 at just $ 70/MWh the lowest price CSP to date . The DEWA project in Dubai , under construction in 2019 , held the world record for lowest CSP price in 2017 at $ 73 per MWh for its 700 MW combined trough and tower project ; 600 MW of trough , 100 MW of tower with 15 hours of thermal energy storage daily .",
  "/wiki/Deep_Cryogenic_Treatment": "A cryogenic treatment is the process of treating workpieces to cryogenic temperatures ( i.e . below \u2212190 \u00b0C ( \u2212310 \u00b0F ) ) in order to remove residual stresses and improve wear resistance on steels and even composites . In addition to seeking enhanced stress relief and stabilization , or wear resistance , cryogenic treatment is also sought for its ability to improve corrosion resistance by precipitating micro-fine eta carbides , which can be measured before and after in a part using a quantimet . The process has a wide range of applications from industrial tooling to the improvement of musical signal transmission . Some of the benefits of cryogenic treatment include longer part life , less failure due to cracking , improved thermal properties , better electrical properties including less electrical resistance , reduced coefficient of friction , less creep and walk , improved flatness , and easier machining .",
  "/wiki/Blowout_preventers": "A blowout preventer ( BOP ) is a specialized valve or similar mechanical device , used to seal , control and monitor oil and gas wells to prevent blowouts , the uncontrolled release of crude oil or natural gas from a well . They are usually installed in stacks of other valves . Blowout preventers were developed to cope with extreme erratic pressures and uncontrolled flow ( formation kick ) emanating from a well reservoir during drilling . Kicks can lead to a potentially catastrophic event known as a blowout . In addition to controlling the downhole ( occurring in the drilled hole ) pressure and the flow of oil and gas , blowout preventers are intended to prevent tubing ( e.g . drill pipe and well casing ) , tools and drilling fluid from being blown out of the wellbore ( also known as bore hole , the hole leading to the reservoir ) when a blowout threatens . Blowout preventers are critical to the safety of crew , rig ( the equipment system used to drill a wellbore ) and environment , and to the monitoring and maintenance of well integrity ; thus blowout preventers are intended to provide fail-safety to the systems that include them . The term BOP ( pronounced B-O-P , not bop ) [ citation needed ] is used in oilfield vernacular to refer to blowout preventers . The abbreviated term preventer , usually prefaced by a type ( e.g . ram preventer ) , is used to refer to a single blowout preventer unit . A blowout preventer may also simply be referred to by its type ( e.g . ram ) .",
  "/wiki/Electric_double-layer_capacitor": "A supercapacitor ( SC ) , also called an ultracapacitor , is a high-capacity capacitor with a capacitance value much higher than other capacitors , but with lower voltage limits , that bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries . It typically stores 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors , can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries , and tolerates many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries . Supercapacitors are used in applications requiring many rapid charge/discharge cycles , rather than long term compact energy storage - in automobiles , buses , trains , cranes and elevators , where they are used for regenerative braking , short-term energy storage , or burst-mode power delivery . Smaller units are used as power backup for static random-access memory ( SRAM ) . Unlike ordinary capacitors , supercapacitors do not use the conventional solid dielectric , but rather , they use electrostatic double-layer capacitance and electrochemical pseudocapacitance , both of which contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor , with a few differences :",
  "/wiki/Regenerative_braking": "Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that slows down a moving vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy into a form that can be either used immediately or stored until needed . In this mechanism , the electric traction motor uses the vehicle 's momentum to recover energy that would otherwise be lost to the brake discs as heat . This contrasts with conventional braking systems , where the excess kinetic energy is converted to unwanted and wasted heat due to friction in the brakes , or with dynamic brakes , where the energy is recovered by using electric motors as generators but is immediately dissipated as heat in resistors . In addition to improving the overall efficiency of the vehicle , regeneration can significantly extend the life of the braking system as the mechanical parts will not wear out very quickly .",
  "/wiki/Energy_harvesting": "Energy harvesting ( also known as power harvesting or energy scavenging or ambient power ) is the process by which energy is derived from external sources ( e.g. , solar power , thermal energy , wind energy , salinity gradients , and kinetic energy , also known as ambient energy ) , captured , and stored for small , wireless autonomous devices , like those used in wearable electronics and wireless sensor networks . Energy harvesters provide a very small amount of power for low-energy electronics . While the input fuel to some large-scale generation costs resources ( oil , coal , etc . ) , the energy source for energy harvesters is present as ambient background . For example , temperature gradients exist from the operation of a combustion engine and in urban areas , there is a large amount of electromagnetic energy in the environment because of radio and television broadcasting . One of the earliest applications of ambient power collected from ambient electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) is the crystal radio . The principles of energy harvesting from ambient EMR can be demonstrated with basic components .",
  "/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage": "Flywheel energy storage ( FES ) works by accelerating a rotor ( flywheel ) to a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as rotational energy . When energy is extracted from the system , the flywheel 's rotational speed is reduced as a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy ; adding energy to the system correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel . Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel , but devices that directly use mechanical energy are being developed . Advanced FES systems have rotors made of high strength carbon-fiber composites , suspended by magnetic bearings , and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure . Such flywheels can come up to speed in a matter of minutes - reaching their energy capacity much more quickly than some other forms of storage .",
  "/wiki/Fusion_power": "Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions . In a fusion process , two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus , while releasing energy . Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion reactors . Fusion processes require fuel and a confined environment with sufficient temperature , pressure , and confinement time to create a plasma in which fusion can occur . The combination of these figures that results in a power-producing system is known as the Lawson criterion . In stars , the most common fuel is hydrogen , and gravity provides extremely long confinement times that reach the conditions needed for fusion energy production . Proposed fusion reactors generally use hydrogen isotopes such as deuterium and tritium , which react more easily than hydrogen to allow them to reach the Lawson criterion requirements with less extreme conditions . Most designs aim to heat their fuel to tens of millions of degrees , which presents a major challenge in producing a successful design . As a source of power , nuclear fusion is expected to have several advantages over fission . These include reduced radioactivity in operation and little high-level nuclear waste , ample fuel supplies , and increased safety . However , the necessary combination of temperature , pressure , and duration has proven to be difficult to produce in a practical and economical manner . Research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s , but to date , no design has produced more fusion power output than the electrical power input , defeating the purpose .",

  "/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor": "Generation IV reactors ( Gen IV ) are a set of nuclear reactor designs currently being researched for commercial applications by the Generation IV International Forum , with technology readiness levels varying between the level requiring a demonstration , to economical competitive implementation . They are motivated by a variety of goals including improved safety , sustainability , efficiency , and cost . The most developed Gen IV reactor design , the sodium fast reactor , has received the greatest share of funding over the years with a number of demonstration facilities operated . The principal Gen IV aspect of the design relates to the development of a sustainable closed fuel cycle for the reactor . The molten-salt reactor , a less developed technology , is considered as potentially having the greatest inherent safety of the six models . The very-high-temperature reactor designs operate at much higher temperatures . This allows for high temperature electrolysis for the efficient production of hydrogen and the synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels . The majority of the 6 designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction until 2020-30 . Currently the majority of reactors in operation around the world are considered second generation reactor systems , as the vast majority of the first generation systems were retired some time ago , and there are only few Generation III reactors in operation as of 2014 . Generation V reactors refer to reactors that are purely theoretical and are therefore not yet considered feasible in the short term , resulting in limited R & D funding .",
  "/wiki/Gravity_battery": "A gravity battery is an energy storage device that stores gravitational potential energy . Electricity is employed , typically at off-peak times , to raise a mass , which is later released to generate electrical energy via a generator , typically at times of peak demand . Such devices have been considered as part of sustainability/renewable energy drives , addressing the problem of energy storage of electricity . Such devices could be considered an extension of the idea behind the pendulum clock . At a small scale are designs like GravityLight , designed to power a single light bulb , especially in low income countries . Heavy trains run uphill can release that potential by using regenerative braking going downhill . For grid scale storage , weights suspended by cables may generate power as they drop to the bottom of the sea , or - as with Energy Vault - from a crane . Relative costings of gravity storage installations that would use 2000-tonne weights suspended from winches in disused mineshafts , compared with lithium ion batteries , indicate that although the up front cost is high the 25-year lifespan of such equipment - with no degradation of capacity during use - makes a compelling proposition for large-scale grid balancing purposes .",
  "/wiki/Grid_energy_storage": "Grid energy storage ( also called large-scale energy storage ) is a collection of methods used for energy storage on a large scale within an electrical power grid . Electrical energy is stored during times when electricity is plentiful and inexpensive ( especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power , tidal power , solar power ) or when demand is low , and later returned to the grid when demand is high , and electricity prices tend to be higher . As of 2017 [ update ] , the largest form of grid energy storage is dammed hydroelectricity , with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage hydroelectricity . Developments in battery storage have enabled commercially viable projects to store energy during peak production and release during peak demand , and for use when production unexpectedly falls giving time for slower responding resources to be bought online . Two alternatives to grid storage are the use of peaking power plants to fill in supply gaps and demand response to shift load to other times .",

  "/wiki/Lithium-air_battery": "The lithium-air battery ( Li-air ) is a metal-air electrochemical cell or battery chemistry that uses oxidation of lithium at the anode and reduction of oxygen at the cathode to induce a current flow . Pairing lithium and ambient oxygen can theoretically lead to electrochemical cells with the highest possible specific energy . Indeed , the theoretical specific energy of a non-aqueous Li-air battery , in the charged state with Li2O2 product and excluding the oxygen mass , is ~40.1 MJ/kg . This is comparable to the theoretical specific energy of gasoline , ~46.8 MJ/kg . In practice , Li-air batteries with a specific energy of ~6.12 MJ/kg at the cell level have been demonstrated . This is about 5 times greater than that of a commercial lithium-ion battery , and is sufficient to run a 2,000 kg EV for ~500 km ( 310 miles ) on one charge using 60 kg of batteries . However , the practical power and life-cycle of Li-air batteries need significant improvements before they can find a market niche . Significant electrolyte advances are needed to develop a commercial implementation . Four approaches are active : aprotic , aqueous , solid state and mixed aqueous-aprotic . Metal-air batteries , specifically zinc-air , have received attention due to potentially high energy densities .

  "/wiki/Electric_car": "An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors , using energy stored in rechargeable batteries . The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s . Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century , until advances in internal combustion engines , electric starters in particular , and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles . From 2008 , a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries , and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban air quality . Several national and local governments have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles , tax credits , subsidies , and other incentives to promote the introduction and adoption in the mass market of new electric vehicles , often depending on battery size , their electric range and purchase price . The current maximum tax credit allowed by the US Government is US $ 7,500 per car . Compared with internal combustion engine cars , electric cars are quieter , and have no tailpipe emissions and lower emissions in general . In January 2019 and updated in April , a Reuters analysis of 29 global automakers concluded that automakers are planning on spending $ 300 billion over the next 5 to 10 years on electric cars , with 45% of that investment projected to occur in China . Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations , these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas . The Tesla Model 3 was the world 's best selling EV from 2018 to 2019 and had a maximum electric range of 500 km ( 310 miles ) according to the EPA . As of December 2018 [ update ] , there were about 5.3 million light-duty all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in use around the world .

  "/wiki/Lithium\u2013sulfur_battery": "The lithium-sulfur battery ( Li-S battery ) is a type of rechargeable battery , notable for its high specific energy . The low atomic weight of lithium and moderate atomic weight of sulfur means that Li-S batteries are relatively light ( about the density of water ) . They were used on the longest and highest-altitude unmanned solar-powered aeroplane flight ( at the time ) by Zephyr 6 in August 2008 . Lithium-sulfur batteries may succeed lithium-ion cells because of their higher energy density and reduced cost due to the use of sulfur . Currently the best Li-S batteries offer specific energies on the order of 500 W\u00b7h/kg , significantly better than most lithium-ion batteries , which are in the range of 150-250 W\u00b7h/kg . Li-S batteries with up to 1,500 charge and discharge cycles have been demonstrated , but cycle life tests at commercial scale and with lean electrolyte are still needed . As of early 2014 , none were commercially available . The key issue of Li-S battery is the polysulfide shuttle effect that is responsible for the progressive leakage of active material from the cathode resulting in low life cycle of the battery . Moreover , the extremely low electrical conductivity of sulfur cathode requires an extra mass for a conducting agent in order to exploit the whole contribution of active mass to the capacity . Large volume expansion of sulfur cathode from S to Li2S and the large amount of electrolyte needed are also issues to address .",

  "/wiki/Magnonics": "Magnonics is an emerging field of modern magnetism , which can be considered a sub-field of modern solid state physics . Magnonics combines the study of waves and magnetism . Its main aim is to investigate the behaviour of spin waves in nano-structure elements . In essence , spin waves are a propagating re-ordering of the magnetisation in a material and arise from the precession of magnetic moments . Magnetic moments arise from the orbital and spin moments of the electron , most often it is this spin moment that contributes to the net magnetic moment . Following the success of the modern hard disk , there is much current interest in future magnetic data storage and using spin waves for things such as 'magnonic ' logic and data storage . Similarly , spintronics looks to utilize the inherent spin degree of freedom to complement the already successful charge property of the electron used in contemporary electronics . Modern magnetism is concerned with furthering the understanding of the behaviour of the magnetisation on very small ( sub-micrometre ) length scales and very fast ( sub-nanosecond ) timescales and how this can be applied to improving existing or generating new technologies and computing concepts . A magnon torque device was invented and later perfected at the National University of Singapore 's Electrical & Computer Engineering department , which is based on such potential uses , with results published on November 29 , 2019 , in Science . A magnonic crystal is a magnetic metamaterial with alternating magnetic properties . Like conventional metamaterials , their properties arise from geometrical structuring , rather than their bandstructure or composition directly . Small spatial inhomogeneities create an effective macroscopic behaviour , leading to properties not readily found in nature .",
