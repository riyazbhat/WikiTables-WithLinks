It is bordered by Mozambique to its northeast and South Africa to its north , west , and south . At no more than 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) north to south and 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) east to west , Eswatini is one of the smallest countries in Africa ; despite this , its climate and topography are diverse , ranging from a cool and mountainous highveld to a hot and dry lowveld . The population is composed primarily of ethnic Swazis . The language is Swazi ( siSwati in native form ) . The Swazis established their kingdom in the mid-18th century under the leadership of Ngwane III . The country and the Swazi take their names from Mswati II , the 19th-century king under whose rule Swazi territory was expanded and unified ; the present boundaries were drawn up in 1881 in the midst of the Scramble for Africa . After the Second Boer War , the kingdom , under the name of Swaziland , was a British protectorate from 1903 until it regained its independence on 6 September 1968 . In April 2018 , the official name was changed from Kingdom of Swaziland to Kingdom of Eswatini , mirroring the name commonly used in Swazi . The government is an absolute monarchy , ruled by King Mswati III since 1986 . Elections are held every five years to determine the House of Assembly and the Senate majority . The current constitution was adopted in 2005 .",

An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BCE , which was succeeded in the third century CE by the Sasanian Empire , a leading world power for the next four centuries . Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century CE , and the subsequent Islamization of Iran led to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion .

By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s .
