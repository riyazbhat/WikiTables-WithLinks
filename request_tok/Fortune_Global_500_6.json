The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender , body type , social , and geographic considerations . Clothing serves many purposes : it can serve as protection from the elements , rough surfaces , rash-causing plants , insect bites , splinters , thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment . Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions , and they can provide a hygienic barrier , keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body . Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation . Wearing clothes is also a social norm , and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing .

Some references add that chemical substance can not be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods , i.e. , without breaking chemical bonds . Chemical substances can be simple substances , chemical compounds , or alloys . Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition , depending on expert viewpoint . Chemical substances are often called 'pure ' to set them apart from mixtures . A common example of a chemical substance is pure water ; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory . Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond ( carbon ) , gold , table salt ( sodium chloride ) and refined sugar ( sucrose ) . However , in practice , no substance is entirely pure , and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical . Chemical substances exist as solids , liquids , gases , or plasma , and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure . Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions . Forms of energy , such as light and heat , are not matter , and are thus not substances in this regard .",

  "/wiki/Energy": "In physics , energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on , or to heat , the object . [ note 1 ] Energy is a conserved quantity ; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form , but not created or destroyed . The SI unit of energy is the joule , which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton . Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . Mass and energy are closely related . Due to mass-energy equivalence , any object that has mass when stationary ( called rest mass ) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy , and any additional energy ( of any form ) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object 's total mass just as it increases its total energy . For example , after heating an object , its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass , with a sensitive enough scale . Living organisms require energy to stay alive , such as the energy humans get from food . Human civilization requires energy to function , which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels , nuclear fuel , or renewable energy . The processes of Earth 's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth .",

  "/wiki/Telecommunications": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) .",

  "/wiki/U.S._Postal_Service": "The United States Postal Service ( USPS ; also known as the Post Office , U.S. Mail , or Postal Service ) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for providing postal service in the United States , including its insular areas and associated states . It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution . The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress , when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general . The Post Office Department was created in 1792 with the passage of the Postal Service Act . It was elevated to a cabinet-level department in 1872 , and was transformed by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 into the United States Postal Service as an independent agency . The USPS , as of 2018 , has 497,157 career employees and 137,290 non-career employees . The Postal Service is legally obligated to serve all Americans , regardless of geography , at uniform price and quality . The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked U.S. Mail and personal letterboxes in the United States , but now has to compete against private package delivery services , such as United Parcel Service , FedEx , and Amazon . Since the early 1980s , many of the direct tax subsidies to the Post Office , with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters , have been reduced or eliminated , in addition to the advantages associated with a government-enforced monopoly on the delivery of first-class mail . Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume , after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act which mandated that $ 5.5 billion per year be paid to fully prefund employee retirement health benefits , revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced declining mail volume , prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit .",

The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District . Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018 [ update ] , making it the 20th most populous city in the United States .

While wholesalers of most products usually operate from independent premises , wholesale marketing for foodstuffs can take place at specific wholesale markets where all traders are congregated . Traditionally , wholesalers were closer to the markets they supplied than the source from which they got the products . However , with the advent of the internet and e-procurement there are an increasing number of wholesalers located nearer to the manufacturers in China , Taiwan , and Southeast Asia . In the banking industry wholesale usually refers to wholesale banking , providing tailored services to large customers , in contrast with retail banking , providing standardized services to large numbers of smaller customers .",
