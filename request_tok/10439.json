  "/wiki/Alphaville_(film)": "Alphaville : une \u00e9trange aventure de Lemmy Caution ( Alphaville : A Strange Adventure of Lemmy Caution ) is a 1965 French New Wave science-fiction neo-noir film directed by Jean-Luc Godard . It stars Eddie Constantine , Anna Karina , Howard Vernon and Akim Tamiroff . The film won the Golden Bear award of the 15th Berlin International Film Festival in 1965 . Alphaville combines the genres of dystopian science fiction and film noir . There are no special props or futuristic sets ; instead , the film was shot in real locations in Paris , the night-time streets of the capital becoming the streets of Alphaville , while modernist glass and concrete buildings ( that in 1965 were new and strange architectural designs ) represent the city 's interiors . The film is set in the future but the characters also refer to twentieth-century events ; for example , the hero describes himself as a Guadalcanal veteran . Expatriate American actor Eddie Constantine plays Lemmy Caution , a trenchcoat-wearing secret agent . Constantine had already played this or similar roles in dozens of previous films ; the character was originally created by British pulp novelist Peter Cheyney . However , in Alphaville , director Jean-Luc Godard moves Caution away from his usual twentieth-century setting and places him in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia , the technocratic dictatorship of Alphaville .",

  "/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)": "The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . Widely regarded to be one of the greatest films in cinema history , it is the most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baum 's 1900 children 's fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Directed primarily by Victor Fleming ( who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind ) , the film stars Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale alongside Ray Bolger , Jack Haley , and Bert Lahr . Characterized by its use of Technicolor , fantasy storytelling , musical score , and memorable characters , the film has become an American pop culture icon . It was nominated for six Academy Awards , including Best Picture , but lost to Gone with the Wind , also directed by Fleming . It did win in two other categories : Best Original Song for Over the Rainbow and Best Original Score by Herbert Stothart .

  "/wiki/Land_of_Oz": "The Land of Oz is a magical country first introduced in the 1900 children 's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Oz consists of four vast quadrants , the Gillikin Country in the north , Quadling Country in the south , Munchkin Country in the east and Winkie Country in the west . Each province has its own ruler , but the realm itself has always been ruled by a single monarch . After The Marvelous Land of Oz , this monarch is Princess Ozma . Originally , Baum did not intend for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to have any sequels , but it achieved a greater popularity than any of the other fairylands he created , including the land of Merryland in Baum 's children 's novel Dot and Tot in Merryland , written a year later . Due to Oz 's worldwide success , Baum decided to return to it four years after The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published . For the next two decades , he described and expanded upon the land in the Oz Books , a series which introduced many fictional characters and creatures . Baum intended to end the series with the sixth Oz book The Emerald City of Oz ( 1910 ) , in which Oz is forever sealed off and made invisible to the outside world , but this did not sit well with fans , and he quickly abandoned the idea , writing eight more successful Oz books , and even naming himself the Royal Historian of Oz . In all , Baum wrote fourteen best-selling children 's books about Oz and its enchanted inhabitants , as well as a spin off-series of six early readers . After his death in 1919 , author Ruth Plumly Thompson , illustrator John R. Neill ( who had previously collaborated with Baum on his Oz books ) and several other writers and artists continued the series . There are now over 50 novels based upon Baum 's original Oz saga . Baum characterized Oz as a real place , unlike MGM 's 1939 musical movie adaptation , which presents it as a dream of lead character Dorothy Gale .",

  "/wiki/Dystopia": "A dystopia ( from Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3- bad and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 place ; alternatively , cacotopia , kakotopia , or simply anti-utopia ) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening . It is translated as bad place and is an antonym of utopia , a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work , published 1516 , a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime , violence and poverty . Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization , tyrannical governments , environmental disaster , or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society . Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations particularly in stories set in the future . Some of the most famous examples are George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World and Ray Bradbury 's Fahrenheit 451 . Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society , environment , politics , economics , religion , psychology , ethics , science or technology . Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies , many of which are or have been totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse . Some scholars , such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent , make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias . For example , Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes , whereas anti-utopias function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia . In his Dystopia : A Natural History ( Oxford University Press , 2017 ) Claeys offers a more nuanced and historical approach to these definitions . Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution . Its commonly anti-collectivist character is stressed , and the addition of other themes ( the dangers of science and technology , of social inequality , of corporate dictatorship , of nuclear war ) are also traced .",
  "/wiki/Alternate_history": "Alternate history or alternative history ( Commonwealth English ) ( AH ) is a genre of speculative fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently . These stories usually contain what if scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record . The stories are conjectural but are sometimes based on fact . Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of literary fiction , science fiction , or historical fiction ; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres . Another term occasionally used for the genre is allohistory ( literally other history ) . Since the 1950s , this type of fiction has , to a large extent , merged with science fiction tropes involving time travel between alternate histories , psychic awareness of the existence of one universe by the people in another , or time travel that results in history splitting into two or more timelines . Cross-time , time-splitting , and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another . In Spanish , French , German , Portuguese , Italian , Catalan and Galician , the genre of alternate history is called uchronie / ucronia / ucron\u00eda / Uchronie , which has given rise to the term Uchronia in English . This neologism is based on the prefix \u03bf\u03c5- ( which in Ancient Greek means not/not any/no ) and the Greek \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( chronos ) , meaning time .

The term is first recorded as Latinized Greek oxym\u014drum , in Maurus Servius Honoratus ( c. AD 400 ) ; it is derived from the Greek \u1f40\u03be\u03cd\u03c2 oks\u00fas sharp , keen , pointed and \u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 m\u014dros dull , stupid , foolish ; as it were , sharp-dull , keenly stupid , or pointedly foolish .

The franchise is owned by Warner Bros. , which distributed the films along with Village Roadshow Pictures .

Every now and then , some of the prisoners manage to break free from the system and , considered a threat , become pursued by the artificial intelligence both inside and outside of it . The films focus on the plight of Neo ( Keanu Reeves ) , Trinity ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) , and Morpheus ( Laurence Fishburne ) trying to free humanity from the system while pursued by its guardians , such as Agent Smith ( Hugo Weaving ) . The story incorporates references to numerous philosophical , religious , or spiritual ideas , among others the dilemma of choice vs. control , the brain in a vat thought experiment , messianism , and the concepts of inter-dependency and love . Influences include the principles of mythology , anime , and Hong Kong action films ( particularly heroic bloodshed and martial arts movies ) . The film series is notable for its use of heavily choreographed action sequences and bullet time slow motion effects , which revolutionized action films to come .

When computer programmer Thomas Anderson , under the hacker alias Neo , uncovers the truth , he is drawn into a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix . The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction . The Wachowskis ' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films , and the film 's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions . The film is known for popularizing a visual effect known as bullet time , where the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed , allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally . While some critics have praised the film for its handling of difficult subjects , others have said the deeper themes are largely overshadowed by its action scenes . The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31 , 1999 , and grossed over $ 460 million worldwide . It was well-received by many critics and won four Academy Awards , as well as other accolades , including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards .
