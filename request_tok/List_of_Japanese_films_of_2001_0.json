  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Science_fiction_film": "Science fiction film ( or sci-fi film ) is a genre that uses speculative , fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science , such as extraterrestrial lifeforms , alien worlds , extrasensory perception and time travel , along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft , robots , cyborgs , interstellar travel or other technologies . Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues , and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition . In many cases , tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held . The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema , when Georges Melies ' A Trip to the Moon ( 1902 ) employed trick photography effects . The next major example in the genre was the film Metropolis ( 1927 ) . From the 1930s to the 1950s , the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies . After Stanley Kubrick 's landmark 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously . In the late 1970s , big-budget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of Star Wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades .",

  "/wiki/Tokusatsu": "Tokusatsu has origins in early Japanese theater , specifically in kabuki ( with its action- and fight-scenes ) and in bunraku , which utilized some of the earliest forms of special effects , specifically puppetry . Modern tokusatsu , however , did not begin to take shape until the early 1950s , [ citation needed ] with the conceptual and creative birth of Godzilla , one of the most famous monsters ( kaiju ) of all time . The special-effects artist Eiji Tsuburaya and the director Ishir\u014d Honda became the driving forces behind 1954 's Godzilla . Tsuburaya , inspired by the American film King Kong , formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the genre , such as so-called suitmation - the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster - combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets . Godzilla forever changed the landscape of Japanese science fiction , fantasy , and cinema by creating a uniquely Japanese vision in a genre typically dominated by American cinema . In 1954 , Godzilla kickstarted the kaiju genre in Japan called the Monster Boom , which remained extremely popular for several decades , with characters such as the aforementioned Godzilla , Gamera and King Ghidorah leading the market . However , in 1957 Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character Super Giant , signaling a shift in popularity that favored masked heroes over giant monsters called the Henshin Boom started by Kamen Rider . Along with the anime Astro Boy , the Super Giant serials had a profound effect on the world of tokusatsu . The following year , Moonlight Mask premiered , the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up one of the most popular tokusatsu subgenres . Created by K\u014dhan Kawauchi , he followed-up its success with the tokusatsu superhero shows Seven Color Mask ( 1959 ) and Messenger of Allah ( 1960 ) , both starring a young Sonny Chiba . These original productions preceded the first color-television tokusatsu series , Ambassador Magma and Ultraman , which heralded the Kyodai Hero genre , wherein a regular-sized protagonist grows to larger proportions to fight equally large monsters . Popular tokusatsu superhero shows in the 1970s included Kamen Rider ( 1971 ) , Warrior of Love Rainbowman ( 1972 ) , Super Sentai ( 1975 ) and Spider-Man ( 1978 ) .",

The word anime is the Japanese term for animation , which means all forms of animated media . Outside Japan , anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics , vibrant characters and fantastical themes . The culturally abstract approach to the word 's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan . Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product . Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism . The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience . Anime is distributed theatrically , by way of television broadcasts , directly to home media , and over the Internet . It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences . Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies . It combines graphic art , characterization , cinematography , and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques ."
