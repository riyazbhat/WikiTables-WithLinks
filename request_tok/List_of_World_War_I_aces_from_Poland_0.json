  "/wiki/Manfred_von_Richthofen": "Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen ( 2 May 1892 - 21 April 1918 ) , known in English as Baron von Richthofen , and most famously as the Red Baron , was a fighter pilot with the German Air Force during World War I . He is considered the ace-of-aces of the war , being officially credited with 80 air combat victories . Originally a cavalryman , Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915 , becoming one of the first members of fighter squadron Jagdstaffel 2 in 1916 . He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot , and during 1917 became leader of Jasta 11 and then the larger fighter wing unit Jagdgeschwader 1 , better known as The Flying Circus or Richthofen 's Circus because of the bright colours of its aircraft , and perhaps also because of the way the unit was transferred from one area of allied air activity to another - moving like a travelling circus , and frequently setting up in tents on improvised airfields . By 1918 , Richthofen was regarded as a national hero in Germany , and respected by his enemies . Richthofen was shot down and killed near Vaux-sur-Somme on 21 April 1918 . There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career , especially the circumstances of his death . He remains one of the most widely known fighter pilots of all time , and has been the subject of many books , films and other media",

  "/wiki/Pour_le_M\u00e9rite": "The Pour le M\u00e9rite ( [ pu\u0281 l\u0259 me.\u0281it ] , French , literally For Merit ) is an order of merit ( German : Verdienstorden ) established in 1740 by King Frederick II of Prussia . The Pour le M\u00e9rite was awarded as both a military and civil honour and ranked , along with the Order of the Black Eagle , the Order of the Red Eagle and the House Order of Hohenzollern , among the highest orders of merit in the Kingdom of Prussia . After 1871 , when the various German kingdoms , grand duchies , duchies , principalities and Hanseatic city states had come together under Prussian leadership to form the federally structured German Empire , the Prussian honours gradually assumed , at least in public perception , the status of honours of Imperial Germany , even though many honours of the various German states continued to be awarded . The Pour le M\u00e9rite was an honour conferred both for military ( 1740-1918 ) and civil ( 1740-1810 , after 1842 as a separate class ) services . It was awarded strictly as a recognition of extraordinary personal achievement , rather than as a general marker of social status or a courtesy-honour , although certain restrictions of social class and military rank were applied . The order was secular , and membership endured for the remaining lifetime of the recipient , unless renounced or revoked . New awards of the military class ( known during the First World War informally as the Blue Max [ German : Blauer Max ] ) ceased with the end of the Prussian monarchy in November 1918 . ( The colloquial name Blue Max was given in honor of Max Immelmann , the first recipient of the Pour le M\u00e9rite during WWI . Immelmann was also the first aviator ever to win the award . ) The civil class was revived as an independent organization in 1923 ( Pour le M\u00e9rite f\u00fcr Wissenschaften und K\u00fcnste ) . Instead of the King of Prussia , the President of Germany acted as head of the order . After the Second World War , the civil class was re-established in 1952",

Vladimir Lenin saw Poland as the bridge the Red Army had to cross to assist other Communist movements and bring about more European revolutions . By 1919 , Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine , emerging victorious from the Polish-Ukrainian War . The West Ukrainian People 's Republic , led by Yevhen Petrushevych , had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim . In the Russian part of Ukraine Symon Petliura tried to defend and strengthen the Ukrainian People 's Republic but as the Bolsheviks began to win the Russian Civil War , they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories , causing Petliura 's forces to retreat to Podolia . By the end of 1919 , a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Pi\u0142sudski . Border skirmishes escalated following Pi\u0142sudski 's Kiev Offensive in April 1920 . The Polish offensive was met by a successful Red Army counter-attack . The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital , Warsaw , while the Directorate of Ukraine fled to Western Europe . Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers increased the interest of Western powers in the war"
