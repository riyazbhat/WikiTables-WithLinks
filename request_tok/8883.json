  "/wiki/Captain_Marvel,_Jr.": "Captain Marvel Jr. , also known as Shazam Jr. ( Frederick Freddy Freeman ) , is a fictional superhero originally published by Fawcett Comics and currently published by DC Comics . A member of the Marvel/Shazam Family team of superheroes associated with Shazam/Captain Marvel , he was created by Ed Herron and Mac Raboy , and first appeared in Whiz Comics # 25 in December 1941 . In the original Fawcett and DC continuity , Captain Marvel Jr. 's alter-ego was Freddy Freeman , a disabled newsboy saved by Captain Marvel from the villainous Captain Nazi . To save the dying boy 's life , Captain Marvel shares his powers with Freddy . By saying the name Captain Marvel , Freddy is transformed into Captain Marvel Jr. , a blue costumed version of himself possessing powers of superhuman strength , speed , wisdom , and more . Junior derived his powers from Captain Marvel himself , while the other Marvels derived their powers from the wizard Shazam . Unlike Captain Marvel and the modern-era version of Mary Marvel , Junior remained a teenager in his transformed state . A Trials of Shazam ! maxi-series published from 2006 to 2008 featured Freddy Freeman undergoing six trials to prove himself worthy of succeeding Captain Marvel , who takes over the wizard Shazam 's post on the Rock of Eternity . Upon completion of the Trials , Freddy assumed the superhero name Shazam . Following DC 's New 52 reboot in 2011 , Freddy Freeman - now a blond instead of the traditional dark-haired youth - appears in current DC Comics publications as one of Billy Batson 's foster siblings , and at Billy 's whim can share the Shazam powers and become an adult superhero . Freddy Freeman made his cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film Shazam ! , portrayed by Jack Dylan Grazer and Adam Brody as a teenager and adult respectively .",

After the Batman R.I.P . storyline , Alfred Pennyworth acts on Batman 's instructions to reassemble the team once more , recruiting new members and more of the team 's original lineup . Another version of the team with a familiar lineup briefly featured in Batman Incorporated in 2011 as the black ops section of Batman 's organisation . Following DC 's 2011 reboot , a new version of the Outsiders is introduced in the pages of Green Arrow as a secret society represented by seven weapon-themed clans .
