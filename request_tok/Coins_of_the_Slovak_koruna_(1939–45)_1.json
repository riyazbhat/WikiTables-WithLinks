  "/wiki/Kroje": "Kroje ( pronounced kro-yeh ) ( singular : kroj ) are folk costumes worn by Czechs and Slovaks . Gothic influence is seen in tying shawls and kerchiefs on the head . Fine pleats and gathered lace collars typify the Renaissance era . From Baroque bell-shaped skirts to delicate Slavic patterns , these folk costumes show the complex growth of Czech and Slovak traditions . Kroje had many regional variants with typical decorations and/or colours . There are three basic types of kroje : Kroje are not worn by people in Czech and Slovak republics anymore , only during feasts people use them as a living tradition . Kroje started being replaced by town clothing during 19th century : it started in bigger cities and towns and villages followed . It was quicker in Bohemia and industrial regions and of course for male clothing , so on the old photos you can see a father in a suit , but a mother ( and possibly children ) in a local costume ( kroj ) . The last regions where kroje were worn on everyday or almost everyday basis were regions near the border between Moravia and Slovakia - Slov\u00e1cko , Hor\u0148\u00e1cko , Vala\u0161sko - where you could meet esp . old women wearing kroje even in the second half of 20th century .",
  "/wiki/Orava_Castle": "Orava Castle ( , , ) , is situated on a high rock above Orava river in the village of Oravsk\u00fd Podz\u00e1mok , Slovakia . It is considered to be one of the most beautiful castles in Slovakia . The castle was built in the Kingdom of Hungary in the thirteenth century . Many scenes of the 1922 film Nosferatu were filmed here , the castle representing Count Orlok 's Transylvanian castle . Orava Castle stands on the site of an old wooden fortification , built after the Mongol invasion of Hungary of 1241 . Its history follows a familiar pattern of construction , destruction , reconstruction , fire , various ownerships and territorial squabbles . The original design was in Romanesque and Gothic style ; it was later reconstructed as a Renaissance and Neo-Gothic structure , hugging the shape of the 520-metre spur on which it perches . The mining magnate Thurzo family , who took charge in the mid 16th century , were responsible for a great deal of rebuilding work , although its present form was not finalised until 1611 . It burned down again in 1800 , after which it was no longer used as a residence . And then , after a period of dilapidation and World War II , the castle became a national monument .",
  "/wiki/Pribina": "Pribina ( c. 800861 ) was a Slavic prince whose adventurous career , recorded in the Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians ( a historical work written in 870 ) , illustrates the political volatility of the Franco-Slavic frontiers of his time . Pribina was the first ruler of Slavic origin to build a Christian church on Slavic territory in Nitra , and also the first to accept baptism . He was attacked and expelled from his homeland by Mojmir I , duke of Moravia . Pribina first fled to Ratpot , one of the border lords in East Francia . Thereafter he was wandering in Central and Southeastern Europe for several years . Finally , in the late 830s , Louis the German , king of East Francia granted Pribina lands near Lake Balaton ( now in Hungary ) where he set up his own principality under the king 's suzerainty . He died fighting against the Moravians .",
  "/wiki/Highwayman": "A highwayman was a robber who stole from travellers . This type of thief usually travelled and robbed by horse as compared to a footpad who travelled and robbed on foot ; mounted highwaymen were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads . Such criminals operated in Great Britain from the Elizabethan era until the early 19th century . In many other countries , they persisted for a few decades longer , until the mid or late 19th century . Highwaywomen , such as Katherine Ferrers were said to also exist , often dressing as men , especially in fiction . The first attestation of the word highwayman is from 1617 . Euphemisms such as knights of the road and gentlemen of the road were sometimes used by people interested in romanticizing ( with a Robin Hood-esque slant ) what was often an especially violent form of stealing . In the 19th-century American West , highwaymen were sometimes known as road agents . In Australia , they were known as bushrangers .",
  "/wiki/Juraj_J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk": "Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk ( first name also Juro or Jurko , ; baptised January 25 , 1688 , died March 17 , 1713 ) was a Slovak highwayman . J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk has been the main character of many Slovak novels , poems and films . According to the legend , he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor , a deed often attributed to the famous Robin Hood . The legend is also known in neighbouring Poland ( under the name Jerzy Janoszik or Janiczek / Janicek ) and the Czech Republic . The actual robber had little to do with the modern legend , whose content partly reflects the ubiquitous folk myths of a hero taking from the rich and giving to the poor . However , the legend was also shaped in important ways by the activists and writers in the 19th century when J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk became the key highwayman character in stories that spread in the north counties of the Kingdom of Hungary ( much in present Slovakia ) and among the local Gorals tourists in the Podhale region north of the Tatras . The image of J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk as a symbol of resistance to oppression was reinforced when poems about him became part of the Slovak and Czech middle and high school literature curriculum , and then again with the numerous films that propagated his modern legend in the 20th century . During the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising , one of the partisan groups bore his name .",
  "/wiki/Tatra_Mountains": "The Tatra Mountains , Tatras , or Tatra ( Tatry either in Slovak ( pronounced [ \u02c8tatri ] ) or in Polish ( pronounced [ \u02c8tatr\u0268 ] ) - plurale tantum ) , is a mountain range that forms a natural border between Slovakia and Poland . They are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains . The Tatras should not be confused with the Low Tatras ( Slovak : N\u00edzke Tatry ) , which are located south of the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia . The Tatra Mountains occupy an area of 785 square kilometres ( 303 sq mi ) , of which about 610 square kilometres ( 236 sq mi ) ( 77.7% ) lie within Slovakia and about 175 square kilometres ( 68 sq mi ) ( 22.3% ) within Poland . The highest peak , called Gerlach , at 2,655 m ( 8710 ft ) , is located north of Poprad , entirely in Slovakia . The highest point in Poland , Rysy , at 2,499 m ( 8200 ft ) , is located south of Zakopane , on the border with Slovakia . The Tatras ' length , measured from the eastern foothills of the Kobyl\u00ed vrch ( 1109 m ) to the southwestern foot of Ostr\u00fd vrch ( 1128 m ) , in a straight line , is 57 km ( 35 mi ) ( or 53 km ( 33 mi ) according to some ) , and strictly along the main ridge , 80 km ( 50 mi ) .

Svatopluk 's career started in the 860s , when he governed a principality within Moravia , the location of which is still a matter of debate among historians , under the suzerainty of his uncle , Rastislav . In 870 Svatopluk dethroned Rastislav , who was a vassal of Louis the German , and betrayed him to the Franks . Within a year , however , the Franks also imprisoned Svatopluk . After the Moravians rebelled against the Franks , Svatopluk was released and led the rebels to victory over the invaders . Although he was obliged to pay tribute to East Francia under the peace treaty concluded at Forchheim ( Germany ) in 874 , he was able to expand his territories outside the Franks ' sphere of interest in the following years . His forces even invaded the March of Pannonia within East Francia in 882 . Svatopluk established a good relationship with the popes , and he and his people were formally taken under the protection of the Holy See in 880 . Pope Stephen V even addressed him as King in a letter written in 885 . Svatopluk seems to have wanted to appease the German clergy who opposed the conducting of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic , and he expelled the disciples of Methodius from Moravia in 886 , after their teacher 's death . Svatopluk 's state was a loose assemblage of principalities and also included conquered territories . Not long after his death Svatopluk 's realm of Great Moravia collapsed in the midst of a power struggle between his sons and the intensifying Hungarian raids .",
  "/wiki/Great_Moravia": "Great Moravia ( ; , Megh\u00e1l\u012b Morav\u00eda ; ; ; ) , the Great Moravian Empire , or simply Moravia , was the first major state that was predominantly West Slavic to emerge in the area of Central Europe , chiefly on what is now the territory of Czechia , Slovakia , Poland ( including Silesia ) , Hungary , and perhaps Serbia ( Vojvodina ) . The only formation preceding it in these territories was Samo 's Empire known from between 631 and 658 AD . Great Moravia was thus the first joint state of the Slavic tribes that became later known as Czechs and Slovaks and that later formed Czecho-Slovakia . Its core territory is the region now called Moravia in the eastern part of Czechia alongside the Morava River , which gave its name to the kingdom . The kingdom saw the rise of the first ever Slavic literary culture in the Old Church Slavonic language as well as the expansion of Christianity after the arrival of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in 863 and the creation of the Glagolitic alphabet , the first alphabet dedicated to a Slavic language . Glagolitic was subsequently replaced by a simpler Cyrillic . The Cyrillo-Methodian cultural mission had significant impact on most Slavic languages and stood at the beginning of the modern Cyrillic alphabet . Moravia reached its largest territorial extent under the king Sv\u00e4topluk I , ( Svatopluk in Czech ) , who ruled from 870 to 894 . Although the borders of his empire can not be exactly determined , he controlled the core territories of Moravia as well as other neighbouring regions , including Bohemia , most of Slovakia and parts of Slovenia , Hungary , Poland and Ukraine , for some periods of his reign . Separatism and internal conflicts emerging after Sv\u00e4topluk 's death contributed to the fall of Great Moravia , which was overrun by the Hungarians who then included the territory of the now Slovakia in their domains . The exact date of Moravia 's collapse is unknown , but it occurred between 902 and 907 . Moravia experienced significant cultural development under King Rastislav , with the arrival in 863 of the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius .",

In modern scholarship , the creation of the early medieval state known as Great Moravia is attributed either to his or to his successors ' expansionist policy . He was deposed in 846 by Louis the German , king of East Francia ."
