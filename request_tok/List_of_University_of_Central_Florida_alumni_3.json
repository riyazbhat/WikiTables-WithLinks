  "/wiki/Entomologist": "Entomology ( from Ancient Greek \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd ( entomon ) , meaning 'insect ' , and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 ( -logia ) , meaning 'study of ' ) is the scientific study of insects , a branch of zoology . In the past the term insect was vaguer , and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla , such as arachnids , myriapods , earthworms , land snails , and slugs . This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use . Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology , entomology is a taxon-based category ; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is , by definition , entomology . Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics , behavior , biomechanics , biochemistry , systematics , physiology , developmental biology , ecology , morphology , and paleontology . At some 1.3 million described species , insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms , date back some 400 million years , and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth .",

To further these outdoor activities , the BSA has four high-adventure bases : Northern Tier ( Minnesota , Manitoba , and Ontario ) , Philmont Scout Ranch ( New Mexico ) , Sea Base ( Florida , US Virgin Islands , and Bahamas ) , and Summit Bechtel Reserve ( West Virginia ) , as well as nearly one hundred separate camps and reservations specifically dedicated to scouts . The traditional Scouting divisions are Cub Scouting for ages 5 to 11 years , Scouts BSA for ages 11 to 18 , Venturing for ages 14 through 21 , and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21 .

The capture and beheading of Steven Sotloff , and of fellow journalist James Foley a month prior , initiated broad public awareness of ISIL/ISIS after the beheadings were shown on the Internet and then on international television . Sotloff 's legacy is , in part , that he broke the Benghazi story to CNN , that there was no protest , and that he foresaw the massive Syrian Refugee Crisis as he reported on the everyday people 's suffering in Syria , thus earning him the reputation as The Voice for the Voiceless .",
