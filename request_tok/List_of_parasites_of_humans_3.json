Ancylostomiasis is also known as miner 's anaemia , tunnel disease , brickmaker 's anaemia and Egyptian chlorosis . Helminthiasis may also refer to ancylostomiasis , but this term also refers to all other parasitic worm diseases as well . In the United Kingdom , if acquired in the context of working in a mine , the condition is eligible for Industrial Injuries Disability Benefit . It is a prescribed disease ( B4 ) under the relevant legislation.\u00a7 Ancylostomiasis is caused when hookworms , present in large numbers , produce an iron deficiency anemia by sucking blood from the host 's intestinal walls .",

They are a diverse animal phylum inhabiting a broad range of environments . Taxonomically , they are classified along with insects and other moulting animals in the clade Ecdysozoa , and unlike flatworms , have tubular digestive systems with openings at both ends . Like tardigrades they have a reduced number of Hox genes , but as their sister phylum Nematomorpha has kept the ancestral protostome Hox genotype , it shows that the reduction has occurred within the nematode phylum . Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another . Consequently , estimates of the number of nematode species described to date vary by author and may change rapidly over time . A 2013 survey of animal biodiversity published in the mega journal Zootaxa puts this figure at over 25,000 . Estimates of the total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation . A widely referenced article published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode , a claim which has since been repeated in numerous publications , without additional investigation , in an attempt to accentuate the importance and ubiquity of nematodes in the global ecosystem ( rather than as a sign of agreement with the estimated taxonomic figure ) . Many other publications have since vigorously refuted this claim on the grounds that it is unsupported by fact , and is the result of speculation and sensationalism . More recent , fact-based estimates have placed the true figure closer to 40,000 species worldwide . Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecosystem : from marine ( salt ) to fresh water , soils , from the polar regions to the tropics , as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations .",

The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family , having a body length of 40 to 70 cm ( 16 to 28 in ) and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg ( 11 to 57 lb ) . Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather . Three of the raccoon 's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws , its facial mask , and its ringed tail , which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas . Raccoons are noted for their intelligence , with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years . They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous , eating about 40% invertebrates , 33% plants , and 27% vertebrates . The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests , but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas , coastal marshes , and urban areas , where some homeowners consider them to be pests . As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century , raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe , Caucasus , and Japan . Though previously thought to be generally solitary , there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific social behavior . Related females often share a common area , while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season , and other potential invaders . Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares ( 7.4 acres ) for females in cities to 5,000 hectares ( 12,000 acres ) for males in prairies . After a gestation period of about 65 days , two to five young , known as kits , are born in spring .",

Arthropods form the phylum Euarthropoda , which includes insects , arachnids , myriapods , and crustaceans . The term Arthropoda as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum Onychophora . Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin , often mineralised with calcium carbonate . The arthropod body plan consists of segments , each with a pair of appendages . The rigid cuticle inhibits growth , so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting . Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an external skeleton . Some species have wings . Their versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments . They have over a million described species , making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species , some of which , unlike most other animals , are very successful in dry environments . Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean Stygotantulus up to the Japanese spider crab .

  "/wiki/Anus": "The anus ( from Latin anus meaning ring , circle ) is an opening at the opposite end of an animal 's digestive tract from the mouth . Its function is to control the expulsion of feces , unwanted semi-solid matter produced during digestion , which , depending on the type of animal , may include : matter which the animal can not digest , such as bones ; food material after all the nutrients have been extracted , for example cellulose or lignin ; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract ; and dead or excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts . Amphibians , reptiles , and birds use the same orifice ( known as the cloaca ) for excreting liquid and solid wastes , for copulation and egg-laying . Monotreme mammals also have a cloaca , which is thought to be a feature inherited from the earliest amniotes via the therapsids . Marsupials have a single orifice for excreting both solids and liquids and , in females , a separate vagina for reproduction . Female placental mammals have completely separate orifices for defecation , urination , and reproduction ; males have one opening for defecation and another for both urination and reproduction , although the channels flowing to that orifice are almost completely separate . The development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of multicellular animals . It appears to have happened at least twice , following different paths in protostomes and deuterostomes . This accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments : the bilaterian body plan , the coelom , and metamerism , in which the body was built of repeated modules which could later specialize , such as the heads of most arthropods , which are composed of fused , specialized segments .",

The larval nematode is acquired by eating raw or undercooked fish and meat . G. spinigerum has a multi-host life history . The eggs hatch in fresh water and the larvae are eaten by water fleas of the genus Cyclops . The water fleas are in turn eaten by small fish . Eventually , the larvae end up in the stomachs of carnivores , usually cats and dogs . The larva bores through the stomach wall and migrates around in the host 's body for about three months before returning to the stomach and attaching itself in the gastric mucosa . It then takes another six months to mature . The eggs are carried in the host 's feces , and if they reach fresh water the cycle begins again .

  "/wiki/River_blindness": "Onchocerciasis , also known as river blindness , is a disease caused by infection with the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus . Symptoms include severe itching , bumps under the skin , and blindness . It is the second-most common cause of blindness due to infection , after trachoma . The parasite worm is spread by the bites of a black fly of the Simulium type . Usually , many bites are required before infection occurs . These flies live near rivers , hence the common name of the disease . Once inside a person , the worms create larvae that make their way out to the skin , where they can infect the next black fly that bites the person . There are a number of ways to make the diagnosis , including : placing a biopsy of the skin in normal saline and watching for the larva to come out , looking in the eye for larvae , and looking within the bumps under the skin for adult worms . A vaccine against the disease does not exist . Prevention is by avoiding being bitten by flies . This may include the use of insect repellent and proper clothing . Other efforts include those to decrease the fly population by spraying insecticides .",

It is one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases listed by the World Health Organization , with elimination from certain countries expected by 2020 . John ONeill , an Irish surgeon , first described Onchocerca volvulus in 1874 , when he found it to be the causative agent of craw-craw , a skin disease found in West Africa . A Guatemalan doctor , Rodolfo Robles , first linked it to visual impairment in 1917 . O. volvulus is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa , and humans are the only known definitive host . It is spread from person to person via female biting blackflies of the genus Simulium .",
  "/wiki/Simulium": "Simulium is a genus of black flies , which may transmit diseases such as onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) . It is a large genus with several hundred species , and 41 subgenera . The flies are pool feeders . Their saliva , which contains anticoagulants , a number of enzymes and histamine , is mixed with the blood , preventing clotting until it is ingested by the fly . These bites cause localized tissue damage , and if the number of feeding flies is sufficient , their feeding may produce a blood-loss anaemia . The host 's reaction to fly attacks may include systemic illness , allergic reactions or even death , presumably mediated by histamine . In humans , this systemic reaction is known as black fly fever and is characterized by headaches , fever , nausea , adenitis , generalized dermatitis , and allergic asthma .",
  "/wiki/Black_fly": "A black fly or blackfly ( sometimes called a buffalo gnat , turkey gnat , or white socks ) is any member of the family Simuliidae of the Culicomorpha infraorder . They are related to the Ceratopogonidae , Chironomidae , and Thaumaleidae . Over 2,200 species of black flies have been formally named , of which 15 are extinct . They are divided into two subfamilies : Parasimuliinae contains only one genus and four species ; Simuliinae contains all the rest . Over 1,800 of the species belong to the genus Simulium . Most black flies gain nourishment by feeding on the blood of mammals , including humans , although the males feed mainly on nectar . They are usually small , black or gray , with short legs , and antennae . They are a common nuisance for humans , and many U.S. states have programs to suppress the black fly population .

It belongs to a group of nematodes called roundworms . This intestinal worm can cause a number of symptoms in people , principally skin symptoms , abdominal pain , diarrhea and weight loss , among many other specific and vague symptoms in disseminated disease , and severe life threatening conditions through hyperinfection . In some people , particularly those who require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication , Strongyloides can cause a hyperinfection syndrome that can lead to death if untreated . The diagnosis is made by blood and stool tests . The medication ivermectin is widely used to treat strongyloidiasis . Strongyloidiasis is a type of soil-transmitted helminthiasis . Low estimates postulate it to affect 30-100 million people worldwide , mainly in tropical and subtropical countries , while higher estimates conservatively extrapolate that infection is upwards to or above 370 million people .

It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa . Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres ( 17,212,000 sq mi ) , about 30% of Earth 's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth 's total surface area . The continent , which has long been home to the majority of the human population , was the site of many of the first civilizations . Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population , but also dense and large settlements , as well as vast barely populated regions . Its 4.5 billion people ( as of June 2019 [ update ] ) constitute roughly 60% of the world 's population , more than all other continents combined . In general terms , Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean , on the south by the Indian Ocean , and on the north by the Arctic Ocean . The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them . It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity . The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East-West cultural , linguistic , and ethnic differences , some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line . The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa ; and to the east of the Turkish Straits , the Ural Mountains and Ural River , and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas , separating it from Europe . China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",
  "/wiki/Toxocariasis": "Toxocariasis is an illness of humans caused by larvae ( immature worms ) of either the dog roundworm ( Toxocara canis ) , the cat roundworm ( Toxocara cati ) or the fox roundworm ( Toxocara canis ) . Toxocariasis is often called visceral larva migrans ( VLM ) . Depending on geographic location , degree of eosinophilia , eye and/or pulmonary signs , the terms ocular larva migrans ( OLM ) , Weingarten 's disease , Frimodt-M\u00f8ller 's syndrome , and eosinophilic pseudoleukemia are applied to toxocariasis . Other terms sometimes or rarely used include nematode ophthalmitis , toxocaral disease , toxocarose , and covert toxocariasis . This zoonotic , helminthic infection is a rare cause of blindness and may provoke rheumatic , neurologic , or asthmatic symptoms . Humans normally become infected by ingestion of embryonated eggs ( each containing a fully developed second stage larva , L2 ) from contaminated sources ( soil , undercooked meat , fresh or unwashed vegetables . ) Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati are perhaps the most ubiquitous gastrointestinal worms ( helminths ) of domestic dogs , cats , and foxes . There are many 'accidental ' or paratenic hosts including humans , birds , pigs , rodents , goats , monkeys , and rabbits . In paratenic hosts , the larvae never mature and remain at the L2 stage . There are three main syndromes : visceral larva migrans ( VLM ) , which encompasses diseases associated with major organs ; covert toxocariasis , which is a milder version of VLM ; and ocular larva migrans ( OLM ) , in which pathological effects on the host are restricted to the eye and the optic nerve .",
  "/wiki/Toxocara_canis": "Toxocara canis ( also known as dog roundworm ) is a worldwide-distributed helminth parasite of dogs and other canids . The name is derived from the Greek word toxon , meaning bow or quiver , and the Latin word caro , meaning flesh . They live in the small intestine of the definitive host . In adult dogs , the infection is usually asymptomatic but may be characterized by diarrhea . By contrast , massive infection with Toxocara canis can be fatal in puppies , causing diarrhea , vomiting , an enlarged abdomen , flatulence , and poor growth rate . As paratenic hosts , a number of vertebrates , including humans , and some invertebrates can become infected . Humans are infected , like other paratenic hosts , by ingestion of embryonated T. canis eggs . The disease ( toxocariasis ) caused by migrating T. canis larvae results in two syndromes : visceral larva migrans and ocular larva migrans . Owing to transmission of the infection from the mother to her puppies , preventive anthelmintic treatment of newborn puppies is strongly recommended . Several anthelmintic drugs are effective against adult worms , for example pyrantel , fenbendazole , and selamectin .",
  "/wiki/Toxocara_cati": "Toxocara cati , also known as the feline roundworm , is a parasite of cats and other felids . It is one of the most common nematodes of cats , infecting both wild and domestic felids worldwide . Adult worms are localised in the gut of the host . In adult cats , the infection - which is called toxocariasis - is usually asymptomatic . However , massive infection in juvenile cats can be fatal . Feline roundworms are brownish-yellow to cream-colored to pink and may be up to 10 cm in length . Adults have short , wide cervical alae giving their anterior ends the distinct appearance of an arrow ( hence their name , toxo , meaning arrow , and cara , meaning head ) . Eggs are pitted ovals with a width of 65 \u03bcm and a length of about 75 \u03bcm making them invisible to the human eye .

  "/wiki/Visceral_larva_migrans": "Visceral larva migrans ( VLM ) is a condition in humans caused by the migratory larvae of certain nematodes , humans being a dead-end host , and was first reported in 1952 . Nematodes causing such zoonotic infections are Baylisascaris procyonis , Toxocara canis , Toxocara cati , and Ascaris suum . These nematodes can infect but not mature in humans and after migrating through the intestinal wall , travel with the blood stream to various organs where they cause inflammation and damage . Affected organs can include the liver , heart ( causing myocarditis ) and the CNS ( causing dysfunction , seizures , and coma ) . A special variant is ocular larva migrans where usually T. canis larvae travel to the eye . Only a few roundworm eggs are necessary to cause larva migrans in the human child or adult . However , visceral larva migrans seems to affect children aged 1-4 more often while ocular larva migrans more frequently affects children aged 7-8 . Between 4.6% and 23% of U.S. children have been infected with the dog roundworm egg . This number is much higher in other parts of the world , such as Colombia , where up to 81% of children have been infected .

According to DSM-V ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition ) criteria , for these actions to be considered pica , they must persist for more than one month at an age where eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate , not part of culturally sanctioned practice , and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention . It can lead to intoxication in children , which can result in an impairment of both physical and mental development . In addition , it can also lead to surgical emergencies due to an intestinal obstruction as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies and parasitosis . Pica has been linked to other mental and emotional disorders . Stressors such as emotional trauma , maternal deprivation , family issues , parental neglect , pregnancy , and a disorganized family structure [ failed verification ] are strongly linked to pica as a form of comfort . Pica is most commonly seen in pregnant women , small children , and persons with developmental disabilities such as autism . Children eating painted plaster containing lead may suffer brain damage from lead poisoning . There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before the phase-out of tetraethyllead or that were sprayed with oil ( to settle dust ) contaminated by toxic PCBs or dioxin . In addition to poisoning , there is also a much greater risk of gastro-intestinal obstruction or tearing in the stomach . Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying parasites . Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs and cats .",

During the initial infection , invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea , abdominal pain , and vomiting . Migration of larvae to muscle , which occurs about a week after being infected , can cause swelling of the face , inflammation of the whites of the eyes , fever , muscle pains , and a rash . Minor infection may be without symptoms . Complications may include inflammation of heart muscle , central nervous system involvement , and inflammation of the lungs . Trichinosis is mainly spread when undercooked meat containing Trichinella cysts is eaten . Most often this is pork , but infection can also occur from bear and dog meat . Several species of Trichinella can cause disease , with T. spiralis being the most common . After being eaten , the larvae are released from their cysts in the stomach . They then invade the wall of the small intestine , where they develop into adult worms . After one week , the females release new larvae that migrate to voluntarily controlled muscles , where they form cysts . The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and confirmed by finding specific antibodies in the blood , or larvae on tissue biopsy .",

Currently , eight species of Trichinella are known , only three of which cause trichinellosis , and Trichinella britovi is one of them . Numerous mammal species , as well as birds and crocodiles , can harbor the parasite worldwide , but the sylvatic cycle is mainly maintained by wild carnivores . Humans represent only a possible host and the parasite is exclusively transmitted through consumption of raw or rare meat . In Europe , pork and wild boar meat are the main sources for human infection . Because of mandatory veterinary controls in slaughterhouses , large trichinellosis outbreaks due to horse-meat consumption are rare , but cases in hunters and their families after raw or rare wild boar meat consumption are regularly reported , with over 100 cases since 1975 . T. britovi in wild boar is relatively resistant to freezing . In France , meat from naturally infected wild boar meat frozen for three weeks at \u221220 \u00b0C ( \u22124 \u00b0F ) remained infectious , whereas the parasites were not viable after four weeks . In the 1960s , trichinella infection was documented in Senegal , West Africa . A survey of 160 wild animals from that region produced plausible evidence that European strains may have originated in Africa . It has also been proposed that strains of T. britovi are isolated to both African and European populations .",
