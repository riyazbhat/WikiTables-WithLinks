In 2000 , Bell Atlantic acquired GTE , which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic 's footprint . Bell Atlantic , the surviving entity , changed its name to Verizon , a portmanteau of veritas ( Latin for truth ) and horizon . In 2015 , Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL , and two years later it acquired Yahoo ! . AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc. ( currently known as Verizon Media ) ."
