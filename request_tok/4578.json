  "/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Hawaii": "The Attorney General of Hawaii ( Hawaiian : Loio Kuhina ) is the chief legal officer and chief law enforcement officer of Hawaii . In present-day statehood within the United States , the Attorney General is appointed by the elected governor with the approval of the state senate and is responsible for a state department charged with advising the various other departments and agencies of state government . The Attorney General is responsible for the prosecution of offenses under state law . The Attorney General can only be removed by an act of the state senate . In rare occasions , the Attorney General serves as acting governor in the absence of both the governor and lieutenant governor from the state for an extended period of time . The office has existed in several forms throughout the history of the Hawaiian Islands . It was created by Kamehameha III and was part of the administration of each successive monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii . The office was kept in the provisional government , after Liliuokalani and the monarchy was overthrown , and became a part of the succeeding administration of the Republic of Hawaii . A regular part of the American model of the executive branch of government , the office of attorney general was part of the Territory of Hawaii under Section 80 of the Hawaiian Organic Act and made an appointed office after statehood was achieved in 1959 . Though a non-partisan office , in territorial days the office of Attorney General has traditionally been appointed from the political party of the sitting President of the United States who appoints the territorial governor . Similarly in statehood , the office of Attorney General has traditionally been appointed from the incumbent governor 's political party , usually Republican or Democrat . The current Attorney General is Clare E. Connors , who was appointed by Governor David Ige on January 3 , 2019 .",

The situation is slightly different in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom . The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales ; in Northern Ireland 's courts , the equivalent position is the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland , and in the courts of Scotland the head of the judiciary of Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session , who is also Lord Justice General of Scotland . These three judges are not , though , part of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , which operates across all three jurisdictions and is headed by the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom . The chief justice can be selected in many ways , but , in many nations , the position is given to the most senior justice of the court , while , in the United States , it is often the President 's most important political nomination , subject to approval by the United States Senate . Although the title of this top American jurist is , by statute , Chief Justice of the United States , the term Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is often used unofficially . In some courts , the chief justice has a different title , e.g . president of the supreme court .

Most decisions of district courts may be appealed to the respective court of appeals of their circuit , with a small number instead being appealable to the Federal Circuit , or directly to the Supreme Court . In contrast to the Supreme Court , which was established by Article III of the Constitution , the district courts were established by Congress . [ note 1 ] There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all . Indeed , after the ratification of the Constitution , some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that , outside jurisdictions under direct federal control , like Washington , D.C. , and the territories , the federal court system be limited to the Supreme Court , which would hear appeals from state courts . This view did not prevail , however , and the first Congress created the district court system that is still in place today . There is at least one judicial district for each state , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico . The territories ( insular areas ) of Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , and the United States Virgin Islands each have one territorial court ; these courts are called district courts and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts , but differ from district courts in that territorial courts are Article IV courts , with judges who serve ten-year terms rather than the lifetime tenure of judges of Article III courts , such as the district court judges .

  "/wiki/Justice": "Justice , in its broadest context , includes both the attainment of that which is just and the philosophical discussion of that which is just . The concept of justice is based on numerous fields , and many differing viewpoints and perspectives including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics , rationality , law , religion , equity and fairness . Often , the general discussion of justice is divided into the realm of social justice as found in philosophy , theology and religion , and , procedural justice as found in the study and application of the law . The concept of justice differs in every culture . Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic , and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics . Throughout history various theories have been established . Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God . In the 1600s , theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law . Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned . In the 1800s , utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is what has the best consequences . Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed , between whom they are to be distributed , and what is the proper distribution .

  "/wiki/University_of_Mississippi": "The University of Mississippi ( colloquially known as Ole Miss ) is a public research university in Oxford , Mississippi . Including the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson , it is the state 's largest university by enrollment and is the states flagship university . The university was chartered by the Mississippi Legislature on February 24 , 1844 , and four years later admitted its first enrollment of 80 students . The university is classified as an R1 : Doctoral University - Very High Research Activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education and has an annual research and development budget of $ 121.6 million .

It is one of the 33 colleges and universities participating in the National Sea Grant Program and a participant in the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program . Ole Miss was a center of activity during the American civil rights movement when a race riot erupted in 1962 following the attempted admission of James Meredith , an African-American , to the segregated campus . While the university was integrated that year , the use of Confederate symbols and motifs has remained a controversial aspect of the school 's identity and culture . In response the university has taken measures to rebrand its image , including effectively banning the display of Confederate flags in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in 1997 , officially abandoning the Colonel Reb mascot in 2003 , and removing Dixie from the Pride of the South marching band 's repertoire in 2016 .

  "/wiki/United_States_District_Court": "The United States district courts are the general trial courts of the United States federal judiciary . Both civil and criminal cases are filed in the district court , which is a court of law , equity , and admiralty . There is a United States bankruptcy court associated with each United States district court . Each federal judicial district has at least one courthouse , and many districts have more than one . Most decisions of district courts may be appealed to the respective court of appeals of their circuit , with a small number instead being appealable to the Federal Circuit , or directly to the Supreme Court . In contrast to the Supreme Court , which was established by Article III of the Constitution , the district courts were established by Congress . [ note 1 ] There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all . Indeed , after the ratification of the Constitution , some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that , outside jurisdictions under direct federal control , like Washington , D.C. , and the territories , the federal court system be limited to the Supreme Court , which would hear appeals from state courts . This view did not prevail , however , and the first Congress created the district court system that is still in place today . There is at least one judicial district for each state , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico . The territories ( insular areas ) of Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , and the United States Virgin Islands each have one territorial court ; these courts are called district courts and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts , but differ from district courts in that territorial courts are Article IV courts , with judges who serve ten-year terms rather than the lifetime tenure of judges of Article III courts , such as the district court judges . American Samoa does not have a district court or a federal territorial court , and so federal matters there are sent to either the District of Columbia or Hawaii .",
