  "/wiki/Pattern_book": "A pattern book , or architectural pattern book , is a book of architectural designs , usually providing enough for non-architects to build structures that are copies or significant derivatives of major architect-designed works . A number of pattern books have been very influential in spreading architectural styles . An early author of pattern books was American architect Minard Lafever . In 1829 he published The Young Builders ' General Instructor , followed by Modern Builders ' Guide in 1833 , The Beauties of Modern Architecture in 1835 and The Architectural Instructor in 1850 . His pattern books were influential in spreading his Greek Revival style , which is known as the first major non-British high architectural style in the United States . The style was popular for being not British , and for association with Greek history , ancient and modern , and was greatly facilitated by the pattern books . Orson Squire Fowler notably made a mark on American architecture when he touted the advantages of octagonal homes over rectangular and square structures in his widely publicized book , The Octagon House : A Home For All , or A New , Cheap , Convenient , and Superior Mode of Building , printed in the year 1848 . It is argued by some that this is incorrectly termed a pattern book , but as a result of this popular and influential publication , a few thousand octagonal houses were in fact erected in the United States . Another was Samuel Skidmore 's Tudor Homes of England , which introduced Tudor and Norman elements , such as turrets , stained-glass windows , and spiral staircases into American architecture . After the American Civil War , Second Empire architecture was considered the perfect style for many to demonstrate their wealth and express their new power in their respective communities . The style diffused by the publications of designs in pattern books and adopted the adaptability and eclecticism that Italianate architecture had when interpreted by more middle-class clients . This caused more modest homes to depart from the ornamentation found in French examples in favor of simpler and more eclectic American ornamentation that had been established in the 1850s .",

It was dissolved in 1956 at the death of its last member , Albert Woolson ( 1850-1956 ) of Duluth , Minnesota . Linking men through their experience of the war , the G.A.R . became among the first organized advocacy groups in American politics , supporting voting rights for black veterans , promoting patriotic education , helping to make Memorial Day a national holiday , lobbying the United States Congress to establish regular veterans ' pensions , and supporting Republican political candidates . Its peak membership , at 410,000 , was in 1890 , a high point of various Civil War commemorative and monument dedication ceremonies .

Hambrecht set aside this part of land for recreation and he later donated the land , then called Wildwood Park , to the city of Le Roy with the stipulation that it be used as a park . The original dam was washed away and the citizens of Le Roy rebuilt it and named the body of water Lake Louise for Hambrecht 's sister . In 1961 local advocates arranged a visit by state park officials , who agreed that Wildwood Park could be expanded into a state park . The land was transferred to the state of Minnesota and in 1963 Lake Louise State Park was created by an act of the Minnesota Legislature . At that time it contained only the lake and 636 acres ( 2.6 km2 ) . The boundaries have been expanded since , but usage remains primarily local .

Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H.

Quartz ( silica ) is the mineral form of silicon dioxide ( SiO2 ) . Chert is often of biological origin ( organic ) but may also occur inorganically as a chemical precipitate or a diagenetic replacement ( e.g. , petrified wood ) . Geologists use chert as a generic name for any type of microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline quartz . Chert is usually of biological origin , being the petrified remains of siliceous ooze , the biogenic sediment that covers large areas of the deep ocean floor , and which contains the silicon skeletal remains of diatoms , silicoflagellates , and radiolarians . Depending on its origin , it can contain either microfossils , small macrofossils , or both . It varies greatly in color ( from white to black ) , but most often manifests as gray , brown , grayish brown and light green to rusty red ( occasionally dark green too ) ; its color is an expression of trace elements present in the rock , and both red and green are most often related to traces of iron ( in its oxidized and reduced forms respectively ) .",

In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis ."
