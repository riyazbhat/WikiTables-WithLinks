  "/wiki/Investigative_journalism": "Investigative journalism is a form of journalism in which reporters deeply investigate a single topic of interest , such as serious crimes , political corruption , or corporate wrongdoing . An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report . Practitioners sometimes use the terms watchdog reporting or accountability reporting . Most investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by newspapers , wire services , and freelance journalists . With the decline in income through advertising , many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism , which is time-consuming and therefore expensive . Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together , even internationally ( as in the case of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers ) , or by organizations such as ProPublica , which have not operated previously as news publishers and which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work . The growth of media conglomerates in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism . A 2002 study concluded that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation 's commercial airwaves . The empirical evidence for this is consistent with the conflicts of interest between the revenue sources for the media conglomerates and the mythology of an unbiased , dispassionate media : advertisers have reduced their spending with media that reported too many unfavorable details . The major media conglomerates have found ways to retain their audience without the risks of offending advertisers inherent in investigative journalism .",

  "/wiki/Fugitive": "A fugitive ( or runaway ) is a person who is fleeing from custody , whether it be from jail , a government arrest , government or non-government questioning , vigilante violence , or outraged private individuals . A fugitive from justice , also known as a wanted person , can be a person who is either convicted or accused of a crime and hiding from law enforcement in the state or taking refuge in a different country in order to avoid arrest . A fugitive from justice alternatively has been defined as a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control of the national or sub-national government or international criminal tribunal with an interest in his or her arrest . This latter definition adopts the perspective of the pursuing government or tribunal , recognizing that the charged ( versus escaped ) individual does not necessarily realize that they are officially a wanted person ( e.g. , due to a case of mistaken identity or reliance on a sealed indictment ) , and therefore may not be fleeing , hiding , or taking refuge to avoid arrest . The fugitive from justice is international ( versus domestic ) if wanted by law enforcement authorities across a national border . Interpol is the international organization with no legal authority to directly pursue or detain fugitives of any kind . Europol is the European authority for the pursuit of fugitives who are on the run within Europe , and coordinates their search , while national authorities in the probable country of their stay coordinate their arrest . In the United States , the U.S . Marshals Service is the primary law enforcement agency that tracks down federal fugitives , though the Federal Bureau of Investigation also tracks fugitives . As a verbal metaphor and psychological concept , one might also be described as a fugitive from oneself . Finally , the literary sense of fugitive includes the meaning of simply fleeing . In many jurisdictions , a fugitive who flees custody while a trial is underway loses the right to appeal any convictions or sentences imposed on him , since the act of fleeing is deemed to flout the court 's authority .",
  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5 % of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",
  "/wiki/Pardon": "A pardon is a government decision to allow a person to be relieved of some or all of the legal consequences resulting from a criminal conviction . A pardon may be granted before or after conviction for the crime , depending on the laws of the jurisdiction . Pardons can be granted in many countries when individuals are deemed to have demonstrated that they have paid their debt to society , or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them . Pardons are sometimes offered to persons who were either wrongfully convicted or who claim that they were wrongfully convicted . In some jurisdictions of some nations , accepting a pardon may implicitly constitute an admission of guilt ; the offer is refused in some cases . Cases of wrongful conviction are in recent times more often dealt with by appeal rather than by pardon ; however , a pardon is sometimes offered when innocence is undisputed in order to avoid the costs that are associated with a retrial . Clemency plays a critical role when capital punishment is applied . Pardons are sometimes seen as a mechanism for combating corruption , allowing a particular authority to circumvent a flawed judicial process to free someone that is seen as wrongly convicted . Pardons can also be a source of controversy . In extreme cases , some pardons may be seen as acts of corruption by officials in the form of granting effective immunity as political favors .",
  "/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_New_York": "The governor of New York is the head of the executive branch of New York 's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state 's National Guard . The governor has a duty to enforce state laws , to convene the New York legislature , the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the legislature , and to grant pardons , except in cases of treason and impeachment . Fifty-six people have served as governor , four of whom served non-consecutive terms ; the official numbering only lists each governor once , so there have officially been fifty-six governors . All of them have been men . New York has never had a female governor . This numbering includes one acting governor : the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after the resignation of the governor , under the 1777 Constitution . The list does not include people who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state , such as Lieutenant Governor Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt 's vice presidential campaign in 1900 , or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein , who acted as governor for 10 days in 1968 while the governor , the lieutenant governor and the senate majority leader were out of the state , attending the Republican National Convention in Miami . Four men have become President of the United States after serving as Governor of New York : Martin Van Buren , Grover Cleveland , Theodore Roosevelt , and Franklin D. Roosevelt , and six were Vice President of the United States . Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt held both offices . Two governors have been Chief Justice of the United States : John Jay held that position when he was elected governor in 1795 , and Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice in 1930 , two decades after leaving the governorship . The longest-serving governor was the first , George Clinton , who first took office on July 30 , 1777 , and served seven terms in two different periods , totaling just under 21 years in office . As 18 of those years were consecutive , Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor .",

A member of the Democratic Party , Clinton was known as a New Democrat , and many of his policies reflected a centrist Third Way political philosophy . He is the husband of former secretary of state and former U.S. senator Hillary Clinton . In 1998 , Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives , becoming the second U.S. president to get impeached following Andrew Johnson . The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky , a 22-year-old White House intern . He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office . Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University , University College , Oxford , and Yale Law School . He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975 . After graduating from law school , Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the attorney general of Arkansas , serving from 1977 to 1979 . He later served as governor of Arkansas . As governor , he overhauled the state 's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association .",

  "/wiki/Law_clerk": "A law clerk or a judicial clerk is an individual - generally an attorney - who provides direct assistance and counsel to a judge in making legal determinations and in writing opinions by researching issues before the court . Judicial clerks often play significant roles in the formation of case law through their influence upon judges ' decisions . Judicial clerks should not be confused with legal clerks ( also called law clerks in Canada ) , court clerks , or courtroom deputies who only provide secretarial and administrative support to attorneys and/or judges . Judicial clerks are generally recent law school graduates who performed at or near the top of their class . Serving as a judicial clerk is considered to be one of the most prestigious positions in legal circles , and tends to open up wide-ranging opportunities in academia , law firm practice , and influential government work . In some countries , judicial clerks are known as judicial associates or judicial assistants . In many nations , clerk duties are performed by permanent staff attorneys or junior apprentice-like judges , such as those that sit on France 's Conseil d'\u00c9tat . In English courts , they are known as judicial assistants . The European Court of Justice uses permanent staff attorneys ( r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaires ) and the stagiaires ( young law graduates ) .

The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case , assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties , and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment . In some jurisdictions , the judge 's powers may be shared with a jury . In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation , a judge might also be an examining magistrate .",

In most jurisdictions , the court system is divided into at least three levels : the trial court , which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case ; at least one intermediate appellate court ; and a supreme court ( or court of last resort ) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts . A jurisdiction 's supreme court is that jurisdiction 's highest appellate court . Appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules . The authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another . In some areas , the appellate court has limited powers of review . Generally , an appellate court 's judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the court 's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified .",

  "/wiki/Amnesiac": "Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease , but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs . The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused . There are two main types of amnesia : retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia . Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date , usually the date of an accident or operation . In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades , while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory . Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store . People with anterograde amnesia can not remember things for long periods of time . These two types are not mutually exclusive ; both can occur simultaneously . Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe . In addition , specific areas of the hippocampus ( the CA1 region ) are involved with memory . Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged , amnesia can occur . Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss .",
  "/wiki/Enron": "Enron Corporation was an American energy , commodities , and services company based in Houston , Texas . It was founded in 1985 as a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth , both relatively small regional companies . Before its bankruptcy on December 3 , 2001 , Enron employed approximately 29,000 staff and was a major electricity , natural gas , communications and pulp and paper company , with claimed revenues of nearly $ 101 billion during 2000 . Fortune named Enron America 's Most Innovative Company for six consecutive years . At the end of 2001 , it was revealed that Enron 's reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized , systematic , and creatively planned accounting fraud , known since as the Enron scandal . Enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate fraud and corruption . The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the United States and was a factor in the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . The scandal also affected the greater business world by causing the dissolution of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm , which had been Enron 's main auditor for years . Enron filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York in late 2001 and selected Weil , Gotshal & Manges as its bankruptcy counsel . It ended its bankruptcy during November 2004 , pursuant to a court-approved plan of reorganization . A new board of directors changed the name of Enron to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. , and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and assets of the pre-bankruptcy Enron . On September 7 , 2006 , Enron sold Prisma Energy International Inc. , its last remaining business , to Ashmore Energy International Ltd. ( now AEI ) .",

Rather , the toilet is available for use by the general public , customers , travellers , employees of a business , school pupils , prisoners etc . Public toilets are commonly separated into male and female facilities , although some are unisex , especially for small or single-occupancy public toilets .

  "/wiki/Probate": "Probate is the judicial process whereby a will is proved in a court of law and accepted as a valid public document that is the true last testament of the deceased , or whereby the estate is settled according to the laws of intestacy in the state of residence [ or real property ] of the deceased at time of death in the absence of a legal will . The granting of probate is the first step in the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased person , resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person 's property under a will . A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator 's ( deceased person 's ) will and grants its approval , also known as granting probate , to the executor . The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary . A probate also officially appoints the executor ( or personal representative ) , generally named in the will , as having legal power to dispose of the testator 's assets in the manner specified in the testator 's will . However , through the probate process , a will may be contested .",
  "/wiki/Cryonics": "Cryonics ( from Greek : \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03c2 kryos meaning 'cold ' ) is the low-temperature freezing ( usually at \u2212196 \u00b0C or \u2212320.8 \u00b0F or 77.1 K ) and storage of a human corpse or severed head , with the speculative hope that resurrection may be possible in the future . Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community . It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience , and its practice has been characterized as quackery . Cryonics procedures can begin only after clinical death , and cryonics patients are legally dead . Cryonics procedures may begin within minutes of death , and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation . It is , however , not possible for a corpse to be reanimated after undergoing vitrification , as this causes damage to the brain including its neural networks . The first corpse to be frozen was that of Dr. James Bedford in 1967 . As of 2014 , about 250 dead bodies had been cryopreserved in the United States , and 1,500 people had made arrangements for cryopreservation of their corpses . Economic reality means it is highly improbable that any cryonics corporation could continue in business long enough to take advantage of the claimed long-term benefits offered . Early attempts of cryonic preservations were performed in the 1960s and early 1970s which ended in failure with companies going out of business , and their stored corpses thawed and disposed of .",

  "/wiki/Latex_and_PVC_fetishism": "Rubber fetishism , or latex fetishism , is the fetishistic attraction to people wearing latex clothing or , in certain cases , to the garments themselves . PVC fetishism is closely related to rubber fetishism , with the former referring to shiny clothes made of the synthetic plastic polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) and the latter referring to clothes made of rubber , which is generally thicker , less shiny , and more matte than latex . PVC is sometimes confused with the similarly shiny patent leather , which is also a fetish material . Latex or rubber fetishists sometimes refer to themselves as rubberists . Gay male rubberists tend to call themselves rubbermen . The terms PVC , vinyl and PU tend to be used interchangeably by retailers for clothing made from shiny plastic-coated fabrics . These fabrics usually consist of a backing woven from polyester fibers with a surface coating of shiny plastic . The plastic layer itself is typically a blend of PVC and polyurethane ( PU ) , with 100 % PVC producing a stiff fabric with a glossy shine and 100 % PU producing a stretchy fabric with a silky shine . A manufacturer 's label may say , for example , 67 % polyester , 33 % polyurethane for a fabric that contains no PVC ; or 80 % polyvinyl chloride , 20 % polyurethane with mention of the polyester backing omitted . The plastic layer is often textured to look like leather ( leatherlook , pleather ) , as opposed to smooth ( wetlook , patent ) .",

Murdoch 's father , Sir Keith Murdoch , was a reporter and editor who became a senior executive of The Herald and Weekly Times publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales . After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered media public company and created his own private company , News Limited . In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun . In 1974 , Murdoch moved to New York City , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain . In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet and , in 1985 , became a naturalized U.S. citizen , giving up his Australian citizenship , to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television network ownership . In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes . His holding company News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox ( 1985 ) , HarperCollins ( 1989 ) , and The Wall Street Journal ( 2007 ) . Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 and , during the 1990s , expanded into Asian networks and South American television . By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion . In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens .

  "/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States": "Lobbying in the United States describes paid activity in which special interests hire well-connected professional advocates , often lawyers , to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies such as the United States Congress . It is a highly controversial phenomenon , often seen in a negative light by journalists and the American public , with some critics describing it as a legal form of bribery or extortion . While lobbying is subject to extensive and often complex rules which , if not followed , can lead to penalties including jail , the activity of lobbying has been interpreted by court rulings as constitutionally protected free speech and a way to petition the government for the redress of grievances , two of the freedoms protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution . Since the 1970s , lobbying activity has grown immensely in the United States in terms of the numbers of lobbyists and the size of lobbying budgets , and has become the focus of much criticism of American governance . Since lobby rules require extensive disclosure , there is a large amount of information in the public sphere about which entities lobby , how , at whom , and for how much . The current pattern suggests much lobbying is done primarily by corporations , although a wide variety of coalitions representing diverse groups also occurs . Lobbying takes place at every level of government , including federal , state , county , municipal , and even local governments . In Washington , D.C. , lobbying usually targets members of Congress , although there have been efforts to influence executive agency officials as well as Supreme Court appointments . Lobbying can have an important influence on the political system ; for example , a study in 2014 suggested that special interest lobbying enhanced the power of elite groups and was a factor shifting the nation 's political structure toward an oligarchy in which average citizens have little or no independent influence . The number of lobbyists in Washington is estimated to be over twelve thousand , but most lobbying ( in terms of expenditures ) , is handled by fewer than 300 firms with low turnover . A report in The Nation in 2014 suggested that while the number of registered lobbyists in 2013 ( 12,281 ) decreased compared to 2002 , lobbying activity was increasing and going underground as lobbyists use increasingly sophisticated strategies to obscure their activity . Analyst James A. Thurber estimated that the actual number of working lobbyists was close to 100,000 and that the industry brings in $ 9 billion annually .",

  "/wiki/Polonium": "Polonium is a chemical element with the symbol Po and atomic number 84 . A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes , polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium , though its metallic character resembles that of its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table : thallium , lead , and bismuth . Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes , its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 ( with a half-life of 138 days ) in uranium ores , as it is the penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238 . Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist , they are much more difficult to produce . Today , polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth . Due to its intense radioactivity , which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating , its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only . Polonium was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie , when it was extracted from the uranium ore pitchblende and identified solely by its strong radioactivity : it was the first element to be so discovered . Polonium was named after Marie Curie 's homeland of Poland . Polonium has few applications , and those are related to its radioactivity : heaters in space probes , antistatic devices , sources of neutrons and alpha particles , and poison . It is a radioactive element and extremely dangerous to humans .",

Rinsing with water or mouthwash after brushing with a fluoride toothpaste can reduce the availability of salivary fluoride . This can lower the anti-cavity re-mineralization and antibacterial effects of fluoride . Fluoridated mouthwash may mitigate this effect or in high concentrations increase available fluoride . A group of experts discussing post brushing rinsing in 2012 found that although there was clear guidance given in many public health advice publications to spit , avoid rinsing with water/excessive rinsing with water they believed there was a limited evidence base for best practice .",
  "/wiki/Antifreeze": "An antifreeze is an additive which lowers the freezing point of a water-based liquid . An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments . Common antifreezes increase the boiling point of the liquid , allowing higher coolant temperature . Because water has good properties as a coolant , water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications , such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters . The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes . Commercially , both the additive ( pure concentrate ) and the mixture ( diluted solution ) are called antifreeze , depending on the context . Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase , which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers .",
  "/wiki/Whistleblower": "A whistleblower ( also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower ) is a person who exposes secretive information or activity that is deemed illegal , unethical , or not correct within a private or public organization . The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways : violation of company policy/rules , law , regulation , or threat to public interest/national security , as well as fraud , and corruption . Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally . Internally , a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor . Externally , a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media , government , law enforcement , or those who are concerned . Whistleblowers , however , take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing . Because of this , a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers . Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers , but that protection can only go so far . Whistleblowers face legal action , criminal charges , social stigma , and termination from any position , office , or job . Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public . The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on : private sector , or public sector . Depending on many factors , both can have varying results .",

  "/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency": "Juvenile delinquency , also known juvenile offending , is the act of participating in unlawful behavior as minors ( juveniles , i.e . individuals younger than the statutory age of majority ) . Most legal systems prescribe specific procedures for dealing with juveniles , such as juvenile detention centers and courts , with it being common that juvenile systems are treated as civil cases instead of criminal , or a hybrid thereof to avoid certain requirements required for criminal cases ( typically the rights to a public trial or to a jury trial ) . A juvenile delinquent in the United States is a person who is typically below 18 ( 17 in Georgia , New York , Michigan , Missouri , North Carolina , New Hampshire , Texas , and Wisconsin ) years of age and commits an act that otherwise would have been charged as a crime if they were an adult . Depending on the type and severity of the offense committed , it is possible for people under 18 to be charged and treated as adults . In recent years [ vague ] a higher proportion of youth have experienced arrests by their early 20s than in the past . Some scholars have concluded that this may reflect more aggressive criminal justice and zero-tolerance policies rather than changes in youth behavior . Juvenile crimes can range from status offenses ( such as underage smoking/ drinking ) , to property crimes and violent crimes . Youth violence rates in the United States have dropped to approximately 12 % of peak rates in 1993 according to official US government statistics , suggesting that most juvenile offending is non-violent . However , juvenile offending can be considered to be normative adolescent behavior . This is because most teens tend to offend by committing non-violent crimes , only once or a few times , and only during adolescence . Repeated and/or violent offending is likely to lead to later and more violent offenses .",

  "/wiki/Prison": "A prison , [ a ] also known as a correctional facility , jail , [ b ] gaol ( dated , British and Australian English [ c ] ) , penitentiary ( American English ) , detention center ( or centre if outside the US ) , correctional center , [ d ] ( American English ) or remand center , is a facility in which inmates ( or prisoners ) are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state . Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system : people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial ; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment . In simplest terms , a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed . Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes . Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes , often without trial or other legal due process ; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice . In times of war , prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps , and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps . In American English , the terms prison and jail have separate definitions , though this is not always followed in casual speech . A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time , such as many years , and is operated by a state or federal government . A jail holds people for shorter periods of time ( e.g . for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and is usually operated by a local government . Outside of North America , prison and jail have the same meaning . Slang terms for a prison include : the pokey , the slammer , the cage , the can , the clink , the joint , the calaboose , the hoosegow , crowbar hotel and the big house .",

  "/wiki/Exile": "To be in exile means to be away from one 's home ( i.e . village , town , city , state , province , territory or even country ) , while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return . In Roman law , exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death . Deportation was forced exile , and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property . Relegation was a milder form of deportation , which preserved the subject 's citizenship and property . The terms diaspora and refugee describe group exile , both voluntary and forced , and government in exile describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country . Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it , to avoid persecution and prosecution ( such as tax or criminal allegations ) , an act of shame or repentance , or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit . Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest , detention or exile .",

Tamils constitute 5.9 % of the population in India ( concentrated mainly in Tamil Nadu ) , 15 % in Sri Lanka , [ note 2 ] 6 % in Mauritius , 7 % in Malaysia and 5 % in Singapore . Tamils , with a population of around 76 million and with a documented history stretching back over 2,000 years , are one of the largest and oldest extant ethnolinguistic groups in the modern world . From the 4th century BC onwards , urbanisation and mercantile activity along the western and eastern coasts of what is today Kerala and Tamil Nadu led to the development of four large Tamil political states , the Cheras , Cholas , Pandyas and Pallavas and a number of smaller states , all of whom were warring amongst themselves for dominance . The Jaffna Kingdom , inhabited by Sri Lankan Tamils , was once one of the strongest kingdoms of Sri Lanka , and controlled much of the north of the island . Tamils were noted for their influence on regional trade throughout the Indian Ocean . Artifacts marking the presence of Roman traders show direct trade was active between Rome and southern India , and the Pandyas were recorded as having sent at least two embassies directly to Emperor Augustus in Rome . The Pandyas and Cholas were historically active in Sri Lanka . The Chola dynasty successfully invaded several areas in southeast Asia , including the powerful Srivijaya and the Malay city-state of Kedah . Medieval Tamil guilds and trading organizations like the Ayyavole and Manigramam played an important role in Southeast Asian trading networks .",

  "/wiki/Hitman": "Contract killing is a form of murder in which one party hires another party ( often called a hitman ) to kill a target individual or group of people . It involves an illegal agreement between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment , monetary or otherwise . Either party may be a person , group , or an organization . Contract killing has been associated with organized crime , government conspiracies , and vendettas . For example , in the United States , the gang Murder , Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s . Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing , making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect said party with the murder . The likelihood that authorities will establish that party 's guilt for the committed crime , especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party , makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party .",

She was the first woman to head a democratic government in a Muslim majority nation . Ideologically a liberal and a secularist , she chaired or co-chaired the Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) from the early 1980s until her assassination in 2007 . Of mixed Sindhi and Kurdish parentage , Bhutto was born in Karachi to a politically important , wealthy aristocratic family . Her father , the PPP 's founder and leader Zulfikar , was elected Prime Minister on a socialist platform in 1973 . Bhutto studied at Harvard University and the University of Oxford , where she was President of the Oxford Union . She returned to Pakistan in 1977 , shortly before her father was ousted in a military coup and executed . Bhutto and her mother Nusrat took control of the PPP and led the country 's Movement for the Restoration of Democracy ; Bhutto was repeatedly imprisoned by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq 's military government and then exiled to Britain in 1984 . She returned in 1986 and - influenced by Thatcherite economics - transformed the PPP 's platform from a socialist to a liberal one , before leading it to victory in the 1988 election . As Prime Minister , her attempts at reform were stifled by conservative and Islamist forces , including President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the powerful military . Her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism , and dismissed by Khan in 1990 . Intelligence services rigged that year 's election to ensure a victory for the conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance ( IJI ) , after which Bhutto served as the Leader of the Opposition .",
