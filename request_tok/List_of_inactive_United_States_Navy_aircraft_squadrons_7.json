  "/wiki/Douglas_A-3_Skywarrior": "The Douglas A-3 Skywarrior was a jet-powered strategic bomber developed and produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company . It was designed by Douglas on behalf of the United States Navy , which sought a carrier-capable strategic bomber . During July 1949 , Douglas was awarded the contract to produce its design , having bested eight other aircraft companies ' submissions . Unlike rival designs , which had aimed for a 100,000 lb ( 45,000 kg ) maximum take-off weight , the Skywarrior was developed for a 68,000 lb ( 31,000 kg ) take-off weight , facilitating its use from the navy 's existing Midway-class aircraft carriers . Large portions of the aircraft were produced by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation , including its early Westinghouse J40 turbojet engines , which failed to meet promises and were replaced by the rival Pratt & Whitney J57 engine by mid-1953 . On 28 October 1952 , the prototype XA3D-1 performed the type 's maiden flight . On 31 March 1956 , the Skywarrior entered squadron service with the Navy . Initially used in the nuclear-armed strategic bomber role , the emergence of effective ballistic missiles led to this mission being deprioritised by the early 1960s . Throughout the majority of its later service life , the Skywarrior was tasked with various secondary missions , which included use as an electronic warfare platform , tactical reconnaissance aircraft , and high capacity aerial refueling tanker . It was among the longest serving carrier-based aircraft in history , having entered service during the mid-1950s and withdrawn from use in 1991 . Throughout its service , the Skywarrior was the heaviest operational aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier , which contributed to its nickname of Whale . The Skywarrior is one of only two U.S. Navy attack aircraft intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service , the other being its predecessor , the North American AJ Savage .",

The aircraft was designed shortly after World War II to carry atomic bombs and this meant that the bomber was the heaviest aircraft thus far designed to operate from an aircraft carrier . It was powered by two piston engines and a turbojet buried in the rear fuselage . The AJ-1 first became operational in 1950 and several were based in South Korea during 1953 as a deterrent against the Communists . Of the 140 built , plus three prototypes , 30 were reconnaissance aircraft . Inflight-refueling equipment was deployed on the Savage in the mid-1950s .

  "/wiki/Grumman_A-6_Intruder": "The Grumman A-6 Intruder is a twinjet all-weather attack aircraft developed and manufactured by American aircraft company Grumman Aerospace . The A-6 was developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s in response to a requirement issued by the United States Navy for an all-weather jet-powered carrier-based attack aircraft . It was designed as a successor for multiple existing medium-sized attack aircraft , such as the piston-engined Douglas A-1 Skyraider . Unlike its predecessors , and even some contemporaries , the A-6 made extensive use of interconnected avionics . Operated by a crew of two in a side-by-side seating configuration , the workload were divided between the pilot and weapons officer . In addition to conventional munitions , the type was also compatible with the Navy 's air-based nuclear weapons , which were deployable via a toss bombing techniques . On 19 April 1960 , the prototype performed the type 's maiden flight . The A-6 was in service with the United States Navy and Marine Corps between 1963 and 1997 , multiple variants of the type being introduced during this time . From the A-6 , a specialized electronic warfare derivative , the EA-6B Prowler , was developed . It was deployed during various overseas conflicts , including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War . The A-6 was intended to be succeeded by the McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II , but this program was ultimately terminated canceled , allegedly due to cost overruns . Thus , when the A-6E was scheduled for retirement , its precision strike mission was taken over by the Grumman F-14 Tomcat equipped with a LANTIRN pod ."
