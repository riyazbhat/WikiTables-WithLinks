One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century .
