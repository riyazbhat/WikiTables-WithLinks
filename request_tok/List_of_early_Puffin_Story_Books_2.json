  "/wiki/Natural_history": "Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms , including animals , fungi and plants , in their natural environment , leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study . A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian . Natural history encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it . It involves the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . So while it dates from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's natural history is a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences ; e.g. , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature .",
  "/wiki/Fairy_Tales": "A fairy tale , fairytale , wonder tale , magic tale , or M\u00e4rchen is an instance of a folklore genre that takes the form of a short story . Such stories typically feature entities such as dwarfs , dragons , elves , fairies , giants , gnomes , goblins , griffins , mermaids , talking animals , trolls , unicorns , or witches , and usually magic or enchantments . In most cultures , there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale ; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies . Fairy tales may be distinguished [ by whom ? ] from other folk narratives such as legends ( which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described ) and explicit moral tales , including beast fables . The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and , at least in recent centuries , mostly relates to children 's literature . In less technical contexts , the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness , as in fairy-tale ending ( a happy ending ) or fairy-tale romance . Colloquially , the term fairy tale or fairy story can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale ; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true , but could not possibly be true . Legends are perceived [ by whom ? ] as real ; fairy tales may merge into legends , where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth . However , unlike legends and epics , fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and to actual places , people , and events ; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times . Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form ; the name fairy tale ( conte de f\u00e9es in French ) was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century .",

The head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a lieutenant governor . Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom . Humans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC . Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century AD , and the Manx language , a branch of the Gaelic languages , emerged . In 627 Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia . In the 9th century , Norsemen established the Kingdom of the Isles , which included the Isle of Man . Magnus III , King of Norway from 1093 to 1103 , reigned also as King of Mann and the Isles between 1099 and 1103 . In 1266 the island became part of Scotland under the Treaty of Perth , after being ruled by Norway . After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England , the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399 . The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765 , but the island never became part of the 18th century kingdom of Great Britain or its successors ( the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the present-day United Kingdom ) .

He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter , contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . His humorous story , The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , was published in 1865 , based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California , where he had spent some time as a miner . The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French . His wit and satire , in prose and in speech , earned praise from critics and peers , and he was a friend to presidents , artists , industrialists , and European royalty . Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures , but he invested in ventures that lost most of it - such as the Paige Compositor , a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision .

  "/wiki/Radium": "Radium is a chemical element with the symbol Ra and atomic number 88 . It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table , also known as the alkaline earth metals . Pure radium is silvery-white , but it readily reacts with nitrogen ( rather than oxygen ) on exposure to air , forming a black surface layer of radium nitride ( Ra3N2 ) . All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive , with the most stable isotope being radium-226 , which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas ( specifically the isotope radon-222 ) . When radium decays , ionizing radiation is a product , which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence . Radium , in the form of radium chloride , was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 . They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later . Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1911 . In nature , radium is found in uranium and ( to a lesser extent ) thorium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite . Radium is not necessary for living organisms , and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity . Currently , other than its use in nuclear medicine , radium has no commercial applications ; formerly , it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers . Today , these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium 's toxicity has become known , and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices .",

  "/wiki/King_Arthur": "King Arthur was a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . The details of Arthur 's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical . The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources , including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur 's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work , Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore , sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn . How much of Geoffrey 's Historia ( completed in 1138 ) was adapted from such earlier sources , rather than invented by Geoffrey himself , is unknown . Although the themes , events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text , and there is no one canonical version , Geoffrey 's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories . Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey 's Historia , including Arthur 's father Uther Pendragon , the magician Merlin , Arthur 's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur 's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon . The 12th-century French writer Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes , who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story , began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature .",
  "/wiki/New_Forest_Pony": "The New Forest pony is one of the recognised mountain and moorland or native pony breeds of the British Isles . Height varies from around 12 to 14.2 hands ( 48 to 58 inches , 122 to 147 cm ) ; ponies of all heights should be strong , workmanlike , and of a good riding type . They are valued for hardiness , strength , and sure-footedness . The breed is indigenous to the New Forest in Hampshire in southern England , where equines have lived since before the last Ice Age ; remains dating back to 500,000 BC have been found within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of the heart of the modern New Forest . DNA studies have shown ancient shared ancestry with the Celtic-type Asturc\u00f3n and Pottok ponies . Many breeds have contributed to the foundation bloodstock of the New Forest pony , but today only ponies whose parents are both registered as purebred in the approved section of the stud book may be registered as purebred . The New Forest pony can be ridden by children and adults , can be driven in harness , and competes successfully against larger horses in horse show competition . All ponies grazing on the New Forest are owned by New Forest commoners - people who have rights of common of pasture over the Forest lands . An annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze . The population of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock . Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945 , but have since risen steadily , and thousands now run loose in semi-feral conditions . The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters , employees of the Verderers of the New Forest .",

This region is bordered by Mexico to the north , Colombia to the southeast , the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south . Central America consists of seven countries : Belize , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , Nicaragua and Panama . The combined population of Central America is estimated at 44.53 million ( 2016 ) . Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot , which extends from northern Guatemala to central Panama . Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc , there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region , such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes , which has resulted in death , injury and property damage . In the Pre-Columbian era , Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east . Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus ' voyages to the Americas , Spain began to colonize the Americas . From 1609 to 1821 , the majority of Central American territories ( except for what would become Belize and Panama , and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas ) were governed by the viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala . On 24 August 1821 , Spanish Viceroy Juan de ODonoj\u00fa signed the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba , which established New Spain 's independence from Spain . On 15 September 1821 , the Act of Independence of Central America was enacted to announce Central America 's separation from the Spanish Empire and provide for the establishment of a new Central American state .

  "/wiki/Little_Women": "Little Women is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott ( 1832-1888 ) which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869 . Alcott wrote the book over several months at the request of her publisher . The story follows the lives of the four March sisters - Meg , Jo , Beth , and Amy - and details their passage from childhood to womanhood . It is loosely based on the lives of the author and her three sisters . :202 Scholars classify it as an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical novel . :12 Little Women was an immediate commercial and critical success , with readers demanding to know more about the characters . Alcott quickly completed a second volume ( titled Good Wives in the United Kingdom , although this name originated from the publisher and not from Alcott ) , and it was also successful . The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled Little Women . Alcott wrote two sequels to her popular work , both of which also featured the March sisters : Little Men ( 1871 ) and Jo 's Boys ( 1886 ) . The novel addresses three major themes : domesticity , work , and true love , all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine 's individual identity . :200 According to Sarah Elbert , Alcott created a new form of literature , one that took elements from Romantic children 's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels , resulting in a totally new format . Elbert argues that within Little Women can be found the first vision of the All-American girl and that her various aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters .",
