  "/wiki/FHM's_100_Sexiest_Women_(UK)": "FHM 's 100 Sexiest Women is an annual listing compiled by the monthly British men 's lifestyle magazine FHM , based on which women they believe to be the sexiest . As of 2017 [ update ] , each year 's list is first announced through a section on FHM 's official website , FHM.com . The first listing was published in 1995 and was voted for by a panel of 250 judges ; the inaugural winner was the German supermodel Claudia Schiffer . From 1996 to 2015 , the poll was instead voted for by the general public , with , at its height , several million votes being cast each year . Subsequent winners included the British singer Cheryl , the American actress Halle Berry , and Jennifer Lopez . [ nb 1 ] At 36 years old , Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the listing , while Lopez was the first to top it more than once . By the time FHM ceased publication of its print edition in January 2016 , the 100 Sexiest Women list had been compiled 21 times . The current holder of the Sexiest Woman title is the Israeli actress Gal Gadot . Alongside the 100 Sexiest Women list , FHM has also twice published a Most Eligible Bachelorettes list , in 2006 and 2007 , to celebrate qualities such as talent , star quality and cash . These lists were topped by the American actress Mischa Barton and the American socialite Kimberly Stewart , respectively . To commemorate the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the 100 Sexiest Women list , two one-off charts were compiled in April 2004 and May 2014 , to recognise the sexiest women up to those points . The winner of the 2004 list was the English singer Louise Redknapp , who had placed on every 100 Sexiest list since 1996 , while the 2014 chart topper was the English singer Rachel Stevens , who had peaked at number two in 2001 , 2002 , and 2004",
