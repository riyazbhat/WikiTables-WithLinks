It is close to the A2 , which follows an ancient British trackway which was used by the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons , and known as Watling Street . The Faversham name is of Latin via Old English origin , meaning the metal-worker 's village . There has been a settlement at Faversham since pre-Roman times , next to the ancient sea port on Faversham Creek . It was inhabited by the Saxons and mentioned in the Domesday book as Favreshant . The town was favoured by King Stephen who established Faversham Abbey , which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 . Subsequently , the town became an important seaport and established itself as a centre for brewing , and the Shepherd Neame Brewery , founded in 1698 , remains a significant major employer . The town was also the centre of the explosives industry between the 17th and early 20th century , before a decline following an accident in 1916 which killed over 100 workers . This coincided with a revival of the shipping industry in the town . Faversham has a number of landmarks , with several historic churches including St Mary of Charity , Faversham Parish Church , the Maison Dieu and Faversham Recreation Ground . Faversham Market has been established for over 900 years and is still based in the town centre",

New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008",

It was originally created by naval architect and industrialist Lewis Nixon in 1915 , upon the outbreak of World War I , to supply some of the warring nations of Europe with gunpowder and other war materials . When the war ended its facilities were put to broader uses , involving other explosive materials . The company manufactured cellulose nitrate ( also known as pyroxylin-plastic ) , the first plastic . Because of its use of nitrate , the material is highly flammable . At the works , cellulose nitrate was maintained in 50-by-20-inch ( 127 by 51 cm ) sheets that had been piled in the surrounding buildings . Within the Works , Nixon leased to the Ammonite Company a storage house located 300 feet ( 91 m ) from its buildings . Ammonite was using the facility to salvage the contents of artillery shells for use as agricultural fertilizer . That salvage occurred after trinitrotoluene ( better known as TNT ) was extracted from the shells at the nearby Raritan Arsenal by Columbia Storage Company , owned by aeronautic pioneer Charles A. Levine . The Ammonite building reportedly contained 1 million US gallons ( 3,800 m3 ) of ammonium nitrate in storage and fifteen tank cars , each holding 90,000 US gallons ( 340,000 L ) of ammonium nitrate in the process of crystallization",

Depending on the amount of nitrogen dioxide present , fuming nitric acid is further characterized as red fuming nitric acid at concentrations above 86 % , or white fuming nitric acid at concentrations above 95 % . Nitric acid is the primary reagent used for nitration - the addition of a nitro group , typically to an organic molecule .
