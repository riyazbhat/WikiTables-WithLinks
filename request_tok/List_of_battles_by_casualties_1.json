  "/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(717\u2013718)": "The Second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717-718 was a combined land and sea offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against the capital city of the Byzantine Empire , Constantinople . The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands , while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil . In 716 , after years of preparations , the Arabs , led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik , invaded Byzantine Asia Minor . The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian , who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III . Leo , however , tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself . After wintering in the western coastlands of Asia Minor , the Arab army crossed into Thrace in early summer 717 and built siege lines to blockade the city , which was protected by the massive Theodosian Walls . The Arab fleet , which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city 's blockade by sea , was neutralized soon after its arrival by the Byzantine navy through the use of Greek fire . This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied by sea , while the Arab army was crippled by famine and disease during the unusually hard winter that followed . In spring 718 , two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected , and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated . Coupled with attacks by the Bulgars on their rear , the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718 . On its return journey , the Arab fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural disasters and Byzantine attacks . The siege 's failure had wide-ranging repercussions .",
  "/wiki/Arab\u2013Byzantine_wars": "The Arab-Byzantine wars were a series of wars between the mostly Arab Muslims and the Byzantine Empire between the 7th and 11th centuries AD , started during the initial Muslim conquests under the expansionist Rashidun and Umayyad caliphs in the 7th century and continued by their successors until the mid-11th century . The emergence of Muslim Arabs from Arabia in the 630s resulted in the rapid loss of Byzantium 's southern provinces ( Syria and Egypt ) to the Arab Caliphate . Over the next fifty years , under the Umayyad caliphs , the Arabs would launch repeated raids into still-Byzantine Asia Minor , twice besiege the Byzantine capital of Constantinople , and conquer the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa . The situation did not stabilize until after the failure of the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 718 , when the Taurus Mountains on the eastern rim of Asia Minor became established as the mutual , heavily fortified and largely depopulated frontier . Under the Abbasid Empire , relations became more normal , with embassies exchanged and even periods of truce , but conflict remained the norm , with almost annual raids and counter-raids , sponsored either by the Abbasid government or by local rulers , well into the 10th century . During the first centuries , the Byzantines were usually on the defensive , and avoided open field battles , preferring to retreat to their fortified strongholds . Only after 740 did they begin to launch their raids in an attempt to combat the Arabs and take the lands they had lost , but still the Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of Asia Minor . With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty , the tide gradually turned . Over a period of fifty years from ca . 920 to 976 , the Byzantines finally broke through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia . The last century of the Arab-Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria , but the border remained stable until the appearance of a new people , the Seljuk Turks , after 1060 . The Arabs also took to the sea , and from the 650s on , the entire Mediterranean Sea became a battleground , with raids and counter-raids being launched against islands and the coastal settlements .",
  "/wiki/Fall_of_Tenochtitlan": "The Fall of Tenochtitlan , the capital of the Aztec Empire , was a decisive event in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire . It occurred in 1521 following extensive manipulation of local factions and exploitation of preexisting divisions by Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s , who was aided by the support of his indigenous allies and his interpreter and companion La Malinche . Although numerous battles were fought between the Aztec Empire and the Spanish-led coalition , which was itself composed primarily of indigenous ( mostly Tlaxcaltec ) personnel , it was the siege of Tenochtitlan - its outcome probably largely determined by the effects of a smallpox epidemic ( which devastated the Aztec population and dealt a severe blow to the Aztec leadership while leaving an immune Spanish leadership intact ) - that directly led to the downfall of the Aztec civilization and marked the end of the first phase of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire . The conquest of Mexico was a critical stage in the Spanish colonization of the Americas . Ultimately , Spain conquered Mexico and thereby gained substantial access to the Pacific Ocean , which meant that the Spanish Empire could finally achieve its original oceanic goal of reaching the Asian markets .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire": "The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , also known as the Spanish-Mexican War ( 1519-21 ) , was one of the primary events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas . There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquerors , their indigenous allies , and the defeated Aztecs . It was not solely a contest between a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs , and most especially the Aztecs ' indigenous enemies and rivals . They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period . For the Spanish , the expedition to Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean . Following an earlier expedition led by Juan de Grijalva to Yucat\u00e1n in 1518 , Spanish settler , Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s , led an expedition ( entrada ) to Mexico . Two years later , in 1519 , Cort\u00e9s and his retinue set sail for Mexico . The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521 , when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cort\u00e9s and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtemoc and Tenochtitlan , the capital of the Aztec Empire . The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico , and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan . Cort\u00e9s made alliances with tributary city-states ( altepetl ) of the Aztec Empire as well as their political rivals , particularly the Tlaxcalteca and Texcocans , a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance . Other city-states also joined , including Cempoala and Huexotzinco and polities bordering Lake Texcoco , the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico . Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual ( Nahuatl , a Maya dialect , and Spanish ) indigenous slave woman , known to the Spanish conquistadors as Do\u00f1a Marina , and generally as La Malinche .",

  "/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe": "The Ottoman wars in Europe were a series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states dating from the Late Middle Ages up through the early 20th century . The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine-Ottoman wars , waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid 14th century , followed by the Bulgarian-Ottoman wars and the Serbian-Ottoman wars waged beginning in the mid 14th century . Much of this period was characterized by Ottoman expansion into the Balkans . The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries , culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe . The Ottoman-Venetian Wars spanned four centuries , starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718 . This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470 , the fall of Famagusta ( Cyprus ) in 1571 , the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 ( at that time the largest naval battle in history ) , the fall of Candia ( Crete ) in 1669 , the Venetian reconquest of Morea ( Peloponnese ) in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715 . The island of Corfu under Venetian rule remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans . In the late seventeenth century , European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the Holy League , reversing a number of Ottoman land gains during the Great Turkish War of 1683-99 . Nevertheless , Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals until the second half of the eighteenth century . In the nineteenth century the Ottomans were confronted with insurrection from their Serbian ( 1804-1817 ) and Greek ( 1821-1832 ) subjects . This occurred in tandem with the Russo-Turkish wars , which further destabilized the empire . The final retreat of Ottoman rule came with the First Balkan War ( 1912-1913 ) , followed by the signing of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres at the close of World War I .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Ostend": "The Siege of Ostend was a three-year siege of the city of Ostend during the Eighty Years ' War and the Anglo-Spanish War . A Spanish force under Archduke Albrecht besieged the fortress being held initially by a Dutch force which was reinforced by English troops under Francis Vere who became the town 's governor . It was said the Spanish assailed the unassailable ; the Dutch defended the indefensible . The commitment of both sides in the dispute over the only Dutch ruled area in the province of Flanders , made the campaign continue for more than any other during the war . This resulted in one of the longest and bloodiest sieges in world history : more than 100,000 people were killed , wounded or succumbed to disease during the siege . Ostend was resupplied via the sea and as a result held out for three years . A garrison did a tour of duty before being replaced by fresh troops , normally 3,000 at a time keeping casualties and disease to a minimum . The siege consisted of a number of assaults by the Spanish , including a massive unsuccessful assault by 10,000 Spanish infantry in January 1602 when governed by Vere . After suffering heavy losses the Spanish had replaced the Archduke with Ambrosio Spinola and the siege settled down to one of attrition with the strong points gradually being taken one at a time . Ostend was eventually captured by the Spanish on 20 September 1604 , but the city was completely destroyed and the overall strategy had changed since the siege had started . The loss of Ostend was a severe blow to the Republic but the Spanish propaganda and strategic objectives were frustrated by the Dutch and English conquest of Sluis a few weeks before the surrender of the city . In addition , the economic cost of such a long campaign and the enormous number of casualties sustained turned the result into a Spanish pyrrhic victory and effectively the siege contributed largely to Spanish bankruptcy three years later which was followed by the Twelve Years ' Truce .",
  "/wiki/Eighty_Years'_War": "The Eighty Years ' War ( Dutch : Tachtigjarige Oorlog ; Spanish : Guerra de los Ochenta A\u00f1os ) or Dutch War of Independence ( 1568-1648 ) was a revolt of the Seventeen Provinces of what are today the Netherlands , Belgium , and Luxembourg against Philip II of Spain , the sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands . After the initial stages , Philip II deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebelling provinces . Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent , the northern provinces continued their resistance . They eventually were able to oust the Habsburg armies , and in 1581 they established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands . The war continued in other areas , although the heartland of the republic was no longer threatened . This included the origins of the Dutch colonial empire , which began with Dutch attacks on Portugal 's overseas territories , which at the time was conceived as carrying overseas the war with Spain due to Portugal being in a dynastic union with Spain . The Dutch Republic was recognized by Spain and the major European powers in 1609 at the start of the Twelve Years ' Truce . Hostilities broke out again around 1619 , as part of the broader Thirty Years ' War . An end was reached in 1648 with the Peace of M\u00fcnster ( a treaty part of the Peace of Westphalia ) , when the Dutch Republic was definitively recognised as an independent country no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire . The Peace of M\u00fcnster is sometimes considered the beginning of the Dutch Golden Age .",

  "/wiki/Peninsular_War": "The Peninsular War [ d ] ( 1807-1814 ) was a military conflict fought by Bourbon Spain and Portugal , assisted by the United Kingdom , against the invading and occupying forces of the First French Empire for control of the Iberian Peninsula during the Napoleonic Wars . The war began when the French and Spanish armies invaded and occupied Portugal in 1807 , and escalated in 1808 after Napoleonic France took over Spain , previously its ally , and installed Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne . The war on the peninsula lasted until the Sixth Coalition defeated Napoleon in 1814 , and is regarded as one of the first wars of national liberation , significant for the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare . The Peninsular War overlaps with what the Spanish-speaking world calls the Guerra de la Independencia Espa\u00f1ola ( Spanish War of Independence ) , which began with the Dos de Mayo Uprising on 2 May 1808 and ended on 17 April 1814 . The French occupation destroyed the Spanish administration , which fragmented into quarrelling provincial juntas . The episode remains as the bloodiest event in Spain 's modern history , doubling in relative terms the Spanish Civil War . A reconstituted national government , the Cortes of C\u00e1diz - in effect a government-in-exile - fortified itself in C\u00e1diz in 1810 , but could not raise effective armies because it was besieged by 70,000 French troops . British and Portuguese forces eventually secured Portugal , using it as a safe position from which to launch campaigns against the French army and provide whatever supplies they could get to the Spanish , while the Spanish armies and guerrillas tied down vast numbers of Napoleon 's troops . [ e ] These combined regular and irregular allied forces , by restricting French control of territory , prevented Napoleon 's marshals from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces , and the war continued through years of stalemate . The British Army , under then Lt. Gen. Sir Arthur Wellesley , later the 1st Duke of Wellington , guarded Portugal and campaigned against the French in Spain alongside the reformed Portuguese army . The demoralised Portuguese army was reorganised and refitted under the command of Gen. William Beresford , who had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Portuguese forces by the exiled Portuguese royal family , and fought as part of the combined Anglo-Portuguese Army under Wellesley . In 1812 , when Napoleon set out with a massive army on what proved to be a disastrous French invasion of Russia , a combined allied army under Wellesley pushed into Spain , defeating the French at Salamanca and taking Madrid .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854\u20131855)": "The siege of Sevastopol ( at the time called in English the siege of Sebastopol ) lasted from October 1854 until September 1855 , during the Crimean War . The allies ( French , Ottoman , and British ) landed at Eupatoria on 14 September 1854 , intending to make a triumphal march to Sevastopol , the capital of the Crimea , with 50,000 men . The 56-kilometre ( 35 mi ) traverse took a year of fighting against the Russians . Major battles along the way were Alma ( September 1854 ) , Balaklava ( October 1854 ) , Inkerman ( November 1854 ) , Tchernaya ( August 1855 ) , Redan ( September 1855 ) , and , finally , Malakoff ( September 1855 ) . During the siege , the allied navy undertook six bombardments of the capital , on 17 October 1854 ; and on 9 April , 6 June , 17 June , 17 August , and 5 September 1855 . Sevastopol is one of the classic sieges of all time . The city of Sevastopol was the home of the Tsar 's Black Sea Fleet , which threatened the Mediterranean . The Russian field army withdrew before the allies could encircle it . The siege was the culminating struggle for the strategic Russian port in 1854-55 and was the final episode in the Crimean War . During the Victorian Era , these battles were repeatedly memorialized . The siege of Sevastopol was the subject of Crimean soldier Leo Tolstoy 's Sebastopol Sketches and the subject of the first Russian feature film , Defence of Sevastopol . The Battle of Balaklava was made famous by Alfred , Lord Tennyson 's poem The Charge of the Light Brigade and Robert Gibb 's painting The Thin Red Line .",

'Eastern War ' ; Turkish : K\u0131r\u0131m Sava\u015f\u0131 ; Italian : Guerra di Crimea ) was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance made up of the Ottoman Empire , France , Britain and Sardinia . The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was a part of the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire 's expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a greater confusion of purpose , yet they led to a war noted for its notoriously incompetent international butchery . While the churches worked out their differences and came to an agreement , Nicholas I of Russia and the French Emperor Napoleon III refused to back down . Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection . Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to . When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement , Nicholas recanted and prepared for war . Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain , the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853 . The war started in the Balkans in July 1853 , when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities ( now part of Romania ) , which were under Ottoman suzerainty , then began to cross the Danube .",
  "/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Nanking": "The Third Battle of Nanking was the last major engagement of the Taiping Rebellion , occurring in 1864 after the death of the king of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom , Hong Xiuquan . There were probably more than a million troops in the battle . Zeng Guofan claimed that the Taiping army sustained 100,000 dead ( and many more wounded ) in the three-day clash , although its most likely an exaggeration . Following the defeat of the Taiping army the Imperial troops , commanded by Zeng Guofan , slaughtered much of the few city 's few remaining population as almost all of the civilian populace had already left northwards to receive food and amnesty from the Xiang army refugee camps due to food shortages . Nanking had been the capital of the Heavenly Kingdom and was known by the Taipings as Tianjing ( Heavenly Capital - the name should not be confused with the coastal city of Tianjin ) . This battle was the effective end of the Taiping army and Nanking was the last major Taiping city to fall back under Imperial control .",
  "/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion": "The Taiping Rebellion , which is also known as the Taiping Civil War or the Taiping Revolution , was a massive rebellion or civil war that was waged in China from 1850 to 1864 between the established Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the Hakka-led Taiping Heavenly Kingdom . Led by Hong Xiuquan , the self-proclaimed brother of Jesus Christ , the goals of the Taipings were religious , nationalist , and political in nature ; they sought the conversion of the Chinese people to the Taiping 's syncretic version of Christianity , the overthrow of the ruling Manchus , and a wholesale transformation and reformation of the state . Rather than simply supplanting the ruling class , the Taipings sought to upend the moral and social order of China . To that end , they established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as an oppositional state based in Tianjing ( present-day Nanjing ) and gained control of a significant part of southern China , eventually expanding to command a population base of nearly 30 million people . For over a decade , the Taiping occupied and fought across much of the mid and lower Yangtze valley . Ultimately devolving into total war , the conflict between the Taiping and the Qing was the largest in China since the Qing conquest in 1644 and it involved every province of China proper except Gansu . It ranks as one of the bloodiest wars in human history , the bloodiest civil war , and the largest conflict of the 19th century . Estimates of the war dead range from 10-30 million . 30 million people fled the conquered regions to foreign settlements or other parts of China . Severely weakened by an attempted coup and unable to capture the Qing capital of Beijing , the Taipings were ultimately defeated by decentralized , irregular armies such as the Xiang Army commanded by Zeng Guofan . Having already moved down the Yangtze River and recaptured the key city of Anqing , Zeng 's Xiang Army began besieging Nanjing in May 1862 . Two years later , on June 1 , 1864 , Hong Xiuquan died and Nanjing fell barely a month later .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg": "The Richmond-Petersburg campaign was a series of battles around Petersburg , Virginia , fought from June 15 , 1864 , to April 2 , 1865 , during the American Civil War . Although it is more popularly known as the siege of Petersburg , it was not a classic military siege , in which a city is usually surrounded and all supply lines are cut off , nor was it strictly limited to actions against Petersburg . The campaign consisted of nine months of trench warfare in which Union forces commanded by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Petersburg unsuccessfully and then constructed trench lines that eventually extended over 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the eastern outskirts of Richmond , Virginia , to around the eastern and southern outskirts of Petersburg . Petersburg was crucial to the supply of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's army and the Confederate capital of Richmond . Numerous raids were conducted and battles fought in attempts to cut off the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad . Many of these battles caused the lengthening of the trench lines . Lee finally gave in to the pressure and abandoned both cities in April 1865 , leading to his retreat and surrender at Appomattox Court House . The Siege of Petersburg foreshadowed the trench warfare that was common in World War I , earning it a prominent position in military history . It also featured the war 's largest concentration of African-American troops , who suffered heavy casualties at such engagements as the Battle of the Crater and Chaffin 's Farm .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south . On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled . The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .",

Port Arthur had been widely regarded as one of the most strongly fortified positions in the world . However , during the First Sino-Japanese War , General Nogi Maresuke had taken the city from the forces of Qing China in only a few days . The ease of his victory during the previous conflict , and overconfidence by the Japanese General Staff in its ability to overcome improved Russian fortifications , led to a much longer campaign and far greater losses than expected . The Siege of Port Arthur saw the introduction of much technology used in subsequent wars of the 20th century ( particularly in World War I ) including massive 28 cm howitzers capable of hurling 217-kilogram ( 478-pound ) shells over 8 kilometers ( 5.0 miles ) , as well as rapid-firing light howitzers , Maxim machine guns , bolt-action magazine rifles , barbed wire entanglements , electric fences , arc lamp searchlights , tactical radio signalling ( and , in response , the first military use of radio jamming ) , hand grenades , extensive trench warfare , and the use of modified naval mines as land weapons .",

The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea , Japan and the Yellow Sea . Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and for maritime trade . Vladivostok was operational only during the summer , whereas Port Arthur , a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by China , was operational all year . Since the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 , Japan feared Russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in Korea and Manchuria . Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in the Siberian Far East from the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century . Seeing Russia as a rival , Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence . Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan . The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into Asia and chose to go to war . After negotiations broke down in 1904 , the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur , China , in a surprise attack . Russia suffered multiple defeats by Japan , but Tsar Nicholas II was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war ; at first , to await the outcomes of certain naval battles , and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a humiliating peace .

The loss of Edirne delivered the final decisive blow on the Ottoman army and brought to a close the First Balkan War . A treaty was signed in London on 30 May . The city was re-occupied and kept by Turkey in the Second Balkan War . The victorious end of the siege was considered an enormous military success because the defenses of city were carefully developed by leading German siege experts and were dubbed 'undefeatable ' . The Bulgarian army , after 5 months of siege and two bold night attacks , took the Ottoman stronghold . The victors were under the overall command of General Nikola Ivanov , and the commander of the Bulgarian forces on the Eastern sector of the fortress was General Georgi Vazov , brother of the famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov and General Vladimir Vazov . One early use of an airplane for bombing took place during the siege : the Bulgarians dropped special hand grenades from one or more airplanes in an effort to cause panic among Turkish soldiers . Many young Bulgarian officers and professionals who took part in this decisive battle of the First Balkan War , later played important roles in the politics , culture , commerce and industry of Bulgaria .

The combined armies of the Balkan states overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success . The war was a comprehensive and unmitigated disaster for the Ottomans , who lost 83% of their territories in Europe and 69% of their European population . As a result of the war , the League captured and partitioned almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire . Ensuing events also led to the creation of an independent Albania which angered the Serbs . However , Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in Macedonia , which provoked the start of the Second Balkan War .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Taiyuan": "The Japanese offensive called \u592a\u539f\u4f5c\u6226 or the Battle of Taiyuan ( Chinese : \u592a\u539f\u6703\u6230 ; pinyin : T\u00e0iyu\u00e1n Hu\u00eczh\u00e0n ; Wade-Giles : T'ai-y\u00fcan Hui-tsan ) was a major battle fought between China and Japan named for Taiyuan ( the capital of Shanxi province ) , which lay in the 2nd Military Region . This battle concluded in loss for the NRA , including part of Suiyuan , most of Shanxi and their most modern arsenal at Taiyuan and effectively ended large-scale regular resistance in the North China area . With these territories occupied , the Japanese obtained the coal supply in nearby Datong , but it also exposed them to attacks by the guerrilla forces of the Nationalist army including the Eighth Route Army , tying down many Japanese troops which could have been diverted to other campaigns .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Shanghai": "The Battle of Shanghai was the first of the twenty-two major engagements fought between the National Revolutionary Army ( NRA ) of the Republic of China ( ROC ) and the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) of the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War . It was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war , later described as Stalingrad on the Yangtze . Since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 followed by the Japanese attack of Shanghai in 1932 , there had been ongoing armed conflicts between China and Japan without an official declaration of war . These conflicts finally escalated in July 1937 , when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the full advance from Japan . Dogged Chinese resistance at Shanghai was aimed at stalling Japanese advance , giving much needed time for the Chinese government to move vital industries to the interior , while at the same time attempting to bring sympathetic Western powers to China 's side . During the fierce three-month battle , Chinese and Japanese troops fought in downtown Shanghai , in the outlying towns , and on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay , where the Japanese had made amphibious landings . The Chinese soldiers had to rely primarily on small-caliber weapons in their defense of Shanghai , against an overwhelming Japanese onslaught of air , naval , and armored striking power . In the end , Shanghai fell , and China lost a significant portion of its best troops , while also failing to elicit any international intervention . The resistance of Chinese forces , however , shocked the Japanese , [ clarification needed ] who had been indoctrinated with notions of cultural and martial superiority , and dramatically demoralized the Imperial Japanese Army . As the battle lasted 3 months , 1 week , and 6 days , it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months . The battle can be divided into three stages , and eventually involved nearly one million troops . The first stage lasted from August 13 to August 22 , 1937 , during which the NRA attempted to eradicate Japanese troop presence in downtown Shanghai .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Wuhan": "The Battle of Wuhan , popularly known to the Chinese as the Defense of Wuhan , and to the Japanese as the Capture of Wuhan , was a large-scale battle of the Second Sino-Japanese War . Engagements took place across vast areas of Anhui , Henan , Jiangxi , Zhejiang , and Hubei provinces over a period of four and a half months . This battle was the longest , largest and arguably the most significant battle in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War . More than one million National Revolutionary Army troops from the Fifth and Ninth War Zone were put under the direct command of Chiang Kai-shek , defending Wuhan from the Central China Area Army of the Imperial Japanese Army led by Shunroku Hata . Chinese forces were also supported by the Soviet Volunteer Group , a group of volunteer pilots from the Soviet Air Forces . Although the battle ended with the eventual capture of Wuhan by the Japanese forces , it resulted in heavy casualties on both sides , as high as 1.2 million combined by some estimates . With the Japanese suffering their heaviest losses of the war , they decided to divert their attention to the north , prolonging the war until the attack on Pearl Harbor . The end of the battle signaled the beginning of a strategic stalemate in the war , shifting from large pitched battles to localised struggles .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk": "The Battle of Dunkirk ( French : Bataille de Dunkerque ) was fought in Dunkirk ( Dunkerque ) , France , during the Second World War , between the Allies and Nazi Germany . As the Allies were losing the Battle of France on the Western Front , the Battle of Dunkirk was the defence and evacuation to Britain of British and other Allied forces in Europe from 26 May to 4 June 1940 . After the Phoney War , the Battle of France began in earnest on 10 May 1940 . To the east , the German Army Group B invaded the Netherlands and advanced westward . In response , the Supreme Allied Commander - French General Maurice Gamelin - initiated Plan D and entered Belgium to engage the Germans in the Netherlands . The plan relied heavily on the Maginot Line fortifications along the German-French border , but German forces had already crossed through most of the Netherlands before the French forces arrived . Gamelin instead committed the forces under his command , three mechanised armies , the French First and Seventh Armies and the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) , to the River Dyle . On 14 May , German Army Group A burst through the Ardennes and advanced rapidly to the west toward Sedan , then turned northward to the English Channel , using Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein 's plan Sichelschnitt under the German strategy Fall Gelb , effectively flanking the Allied forces . A series of Allied counter-attacks - including the Battle of Arras - failed to sever the German spearhead , which reached the coast on 20 May , separating the BEF near Armenti\u00e8res , the French First Army , and the Belgian Army further to the north from the majority of French troops south of the German penetration . After reaching the Channel , the German forces swung north along the coast , threatening to capture the ports and trap the British and French before they could evacuate to Britain . In one of the most debated decisions of the war , the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk . Contrary to popular belief , what became known as the Halt Order did not originate with Adolf Hitler .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_South_Shanxi": "The Battle of South Shanxi , also known as the Battle of Jinnan and Zhongtiao Mountains campaign by the Chinese and as the Chungyuan Operation by the Japanese , was one of the 22 major engagements between the National Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) . At the onset of the battle , KMT-CPC relations were at a low point following the still recent New Fourth Army incident in early 1941 . As a result , the nearby 8th Route Army refused to commit more than a token force to assist the surrounded Nationalists . South Shanxi would later be remembered in China as one of the worst defeats of the entire war .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Odessa_(1941)": "The Siege of Odessa , known to the Soviets as the Defence of Odessa , lasted from 8 August until 16 October 1941 , during the early phase of Operation Barbarossa , the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II . Odessa was a port on the Black Sea in the Ukrainian SSR . On 22 June 1941 , the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union . In August , Odessa became a target of the Romanian 4th Army and elements of the German 11th Army . Due to the heavy resistance of the Soviet 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army , supported by the Black Sea Fleet , it took the Axis forces 73 days of siege and four assaults to take the city . Romanian forces suffered 93,000 casualties , against Red Army casualties estimated to be between 41,000 and 60,000 ."
