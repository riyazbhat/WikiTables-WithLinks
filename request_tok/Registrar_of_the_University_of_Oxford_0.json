  "/wiki/Mary_I_of_England": "Mary I ( 18 February 1516 - 17 November 1558 ) , also known as Mary Tudor , was the queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death . She is best known for her vigorous attempt to reverse the English Reformation , which had begun during the reign of her father , Henry VIII . She restored to the Church some of the property taken from it in the previous two reigns . She was not able to legislate to force those who , at that time , held property which had been plundered from the Catholic Church and the monasteries . During her five-year reign , Mary had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions , which led to her denunciation as Bloody Mary by her Protestant opponents . Mary was the only child of Henry VIII by his first wife , Catherine of Aragon , to survive to adulthood . Her younger half-brother Edward VI ( son of Henry and Jane Seymour ) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine . When Edward became mortally ill in 1553 , he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed , correctly , that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had begun during his reign . Upon his death , leading politicians proclaimed Lady Jane Grey as queen . Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane , who was ultimately beheaded .

Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , the Roman Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels . In 1558 upon Mary 's death , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor .

Edward 's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion . An expensive war with Scotland , at first successful , ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace . The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward , who took great interest in religious matters . Although his father , Henry VIII , had severed the link between the Church and Rome , Henry VIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony . It was during Edward 's reign that Protestantism was established for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass , and the imposition of compulsory services in English .

Along with Thomas Cromwell , he supported the principle of Royal Supremacy , in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm . During Cranmer 's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury , he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed Church of England . Under Henry 's rule , Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church , due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers . However , he succeeded in publishing the first officially authorised vernacular service , the Exhortation and Litany . When Edward came to the throne , Cranmer was able to promote major reforms . He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer , a complete liturgy for the English Church . With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge , he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the Eucharist , clerical celibacy , the role of images in places of worship , and the veneration of saints . Cranmer promulgated the new doctrines through the Prayer Book , the Homilies and other publications .

  "/wiki/Master_in_Chancery": "The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness ( or inequity ) of the common law . The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity , including trusts , land law , the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants . Its initial role was somewhat different : as an extension of the Lord Chancellor 's role as Keeper of the King 's Conscience , the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law . Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts , whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence , and was far more flexible . Until the 19th century , the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than common law courts , such as specific performance and injunctions , and had some power to grant damages in special circumstances . With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841 , the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system . Academics estimate that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century , at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff , the Chancery . Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties , the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century , particularly under the House of York , which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body . From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace , large backlogs , and high costs . Those problems persisted until its dissolution , despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms , particularly during the 19th century . Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s , and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts , which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice , with the Chancery Division - one of three divisions of the High Court - succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body .

  "/wiki/List_of_founding_Fellows,_Scholars_and_Commissioners_of_Jesus_College,_Oxford": "Jesus College , Oxford , the first Protestant college at the University of Oxford , was founded by Elizabeth I in 1571 at the instigation of a Welsh clergyman , Hugh Price . The royal charter issued by Elizabeth appointed a Principal and various Fellows , Scholars and Commissioners : the Fellows to educate the Scholars and to run the college , under the overall direction of the Principal ; and the Commissioners to draw up statutes for the governance of the college , its officers and servants , and the management of the college property . The college was founded to help with the increased numbers of Welsh students at Oxford , and the founding Fellows included a number of individuals with links to Wales . The Commissioners included prominent individuals such as William Cecil , Lord Burghley , the Principal Secretary of State . The charter also gave land and buildings in Oxford to the new college . Whilst the foundation process of the college started in 1571 , it took more than fifty years and a further two charters , one in 1589 from Elizabeth and one in 1622 from her successor , James I , to complete the process . These further charters were necessary because neither the Commissioners appointed by the 1571 charter nor those appointed by the 1589 charter fulfilled their allotted task of drawing up statutes . During this time , Griffith Powell ( one of the Fellows who was pressing for statutes to be drawn up ) concluded that successive Principals were loath to have statutes , since these would limit the Principal 's powers . One Principal lost a draft copy of the statutes ; the next kept the next draft in his study for several years without taking steps to have them confirmed by the Commissioners . It was not until after the 1622 charter that statutes were approved by the Commissioners and the college was fully constituted . Despite the intention on the foundation of the college , none of the charters made special provision for Welsh students , although the students were predominantly Welsh from the outset",
  "/wiki/James_I_of_England": "James VI and I ( James Charles Stuart ; 19 June 1566 - 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625 . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciaries , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union . James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died childless . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , returning to Scotland only once , in 1617 , and styled himself King of Great Britain and Ireland . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonisation of the Americas began . At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament",

During the English Civil War , Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King 's Oxford Parliament . The main site of the college incorporates four medieval halls : Bedel Hall , St Mary Hall , St Martin Hall and Tackley 's Inn , the last being the earliest property acquired by the college and the oldest standing medieval hall in Oxford .

The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the education of clergy , though students now study a broad range of secular subjects .

Little happened at the college during the 18th century , and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards .
