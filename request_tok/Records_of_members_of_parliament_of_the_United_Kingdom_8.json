  "/wiki/Peasants'_Revolt": "The Peasants ' Revolt , also named Wat Tyler 's Rebellion or the Great Rising , was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381 . The revolt had various causes , including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s , the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years ' War , and instability within the local leadership of London . The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official , John Bampton , in Essex on 30 May 1381 . His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation , which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country . A wide spectrum of rural society , including many local artisans and village officials , rose up in protest , burning court records and opening the local gaols . The rebels sought a reduction in taxation , an end to the system of unfree labour known as serfdom , and the removal of the King 's senior officials and law courts . Inspired by the sermons of the radical cleric John Ball and led by Wat Tyler , a contingent of Kentish rebels advanced on London . They were met at Blackheath by representatives of the royal government , who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home . King Richard II , then aged 14 , retreated to the safety of the Tower of London , but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England . On 13 June , the rebels entered London and , joined by many local townsfolk , attacked the gaols , destroyed the Savoy Palace , set fire to law books and buildings in the Temple , and killed anyone associated with the royal government .
