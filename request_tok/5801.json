  "/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)": "The centre ( or center in the United States ) in ice hockey is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play is the middle of the ice , away from the sideboards . Centres have more flexibility in their positioning and are expected to cover more ice surface than any other player . Centres are ideally stronger , faster skaters who can back-check quickly from deep in the opposing zone . Generally , centres are expected to be gifted passers more than goal scorers , although there are exceptions . They are also expected to have exceptional ice vision , intelligence , and creativity . They also generally are the most defensively oriented forwards on the ice . Centres usually play as part of a line of players that are substituted frequently to keep fresh and keep the game moving .",

  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",
  "/wiki/Findlay_Oilers_men's_ice_hockey": "The Findlay Oilers Men 's Ice Hockey is a defunct NCAA 's Division I ice hockey team . The Oilers joined the Division I ranks in 1999 as a founding member of the College Hockey America ( CHA ) conference , along with six other schools , after only three years in existence as a Division II program . Findlay spent five years in the CHA , never finishing higher than fourth in the standings , and only winning a single game in the conference tournament . After a change to the administration of Findlay in the summer of 2003 , the University announced on January 6 , 2004 that the ice hockey program would revert to club and intramural status . The change did not come as a shock to many familiar with Findlay 's situation as head coach Craig Barnett had already resigned to take a position with Lake Forest Academy prep school . The MAAC refused to allow any of its teams to play the Oilers for the 2000-01 season because of conference by-laws prohibiting member teams from playing provisional Division I schools . When the CHA applied for its automatic tournament bid in 2002 , the NCAA had reservations about Findlay 's full Division I status as it had moved the University 's athletic program to Division II status only four years earlier . Because NCAA rules mandate that automatic bid conferences must contain at least six member schools the CHA scrambled to resolve the waiver that would allow Findlay to play in the conference despite the 9-year moratorium mandated by the NCAA on teams playing above their level . The CHA was able to receive the bid for the 2003 season after a waiver was granted retroactively .",

  "/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)": "In ice hockey , a forward is a player position on the ice whose primary responsibility is to score and assist goals . Generally , the forwards try to stay in three different lanes , also known as thirds , of the ice going from goal to goal . It is not mandatory , however , to stay in a lane . Staying in a lane aids in forming the common offensive strategy known as a triangle . One forward obtains the puck and then the forwards pass it between themselves making the goalie move side to side . This strategy opens up the net for scoring opportunities . This strategy allows for a constant flow of the play , attempting to maintain the control of play by one team in the offensive zone . The forwards can pass to the defence players playing at the blue line , thus freeing up the play and allowing either a shot from the point ( blue line position where the defence stands ) or a pass back to the offence . This then begins the triangle again . Each team has three forwards in each line :",

  "/wiki/Defenceman": "Defence ( defense in the United States ) in ice hockey is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . They are often referred to as defencemen , D , D-men or blueliners ( the latter a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which represents the boundary of the offensive zone ; defencemen generally position themselves along the line to keep the puck in the zone ) . They were once called cover-point . A good defenceman is both strong in defensive and offensive play and for defenceman pairing also need to be good at defending and attacking . In regular play , two defencemen complement three forwards and a goaltender on the ice . Exceptions include overtime during the regular season and when a team is shorthanded ( i.e . has been assessed a penalty ) , in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender ; in National Hockey League play in overtime effective with the 2015-16 season the teams have only three position players and a goaltender on the ice and may use either two forwards and one defenceman ( typically ) , or conversely , two defencemen and one forward .",
