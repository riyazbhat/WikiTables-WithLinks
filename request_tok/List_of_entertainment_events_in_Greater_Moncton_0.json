  "/wiki/Sporting_event": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",
  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",
  "/wiki/Figure_Skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions .",

Major McLeod ran the CIAU from his office at RMC as the first CIAU Secretary-Treasurer . In the 1960s the CIAU functioned as a voluntary , autonomous , educational sport organization which represented by the various universities from coast to coast . In 1978 , the Canadian Women 's Interuniversity Athletic Union ( CWIAU ) , which had formed in 1970 , merged with the CIAU ; the expanded CIAU reinforced its university focus by adjusting its name to the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union .",

  "/wiki/Curling": "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet toward the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones , with each player throwing two . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends . The player can induce a curved path , described as curl , by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides . The path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms or brushes , who accompany it as it slides down the sheet and sweep the ice in front of the stone . Sweeping a rock decreases the friction , which makes the stone travel a straighter path ( with less curl ) and a longer distance . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result . This gives curling its nickname of chess on ice .",

He was elected pope by the second papal conclave of 1978 , which was called after Pope John Paul I , who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI , died after 33 days . Cardinal Wojty\u0142a was elected on the third day of the conclave and adopted the name of his predecessor in tribute to him . John Paul II is recognised as helping to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe . John Paul II significantly improved the Catholic Church 's relations with Judaism , Islam , and the Eastern Orthodox Church . He upheld the Church 's teachings on such matters as the right to life , artificial contraception , the ordination of women , and a celibate clergy , and although he supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council , he was seen as generally conservative in their interpretation . He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history , visiting 129 countries during his pontificate . As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness , he beatified 1,340 and canonised 483 people , more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries . By the time of his death , he had named most of the College of Cardinals , consecrated or co-consecrated a large number of the world 's bishops , and ordained many priests . John Paul II was the second longest-serving pope in modern history after Pope Pius IX . Born in Poland , John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the 16th-century Pope Adrian VI .

  "/wiki/Classic_rock": "Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock ( AOR ) format in the early 1980s . In the United States , the classic rock format features rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s to the 1980s , primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format . The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s . Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners , music associated with this format received more exposure with younger generations of listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading . Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station 's sound , or by heritage acts that are still active and producing new music . Conceptually , classic rock has been analyzed by academics as an effort by critics , media , and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy . The music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere , expressing values of Romanticism , self-aggrandizement , and politically undemanding ideologies .",
  "/wiki/Beach_Boys": "The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne , California in 1961 . The group 's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson , their cousin Mike Love , and their friend Al Jardine . Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs , they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era . The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R & B to create their unique sound , and with Brian as composer , arranger , producer , and de facto leader , they often incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways . The Beach Boys began as a garage band led by Brian and managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry . In 1963 , the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance , dubbed the California Sound . From 1965 , they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and Good Vibrations single raised the group 's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . After scrapping the album Smile in 1967 , Brian 's contributions diminished due to his mental health issues . The group 's commercial momentum faltered , and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound , they were dismissed by early rock critics as the archetypal pop music cop-outs . Carl took over as the band 's musical leader until the late 1970s , during which they rebounded with successful worldwide concert tours . Personal struggles , creative disagreements , and the overshadowing success of the band 's greatest hits albums precipitated their transition into an oldies act .",

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants ."
