K\u0151v\u00e1g\u00f3 already moved from there - he also officially reported his new address earlier - thus according to the controller 's own admission he made an appointment with him on the phone and he stated K\u0151v\u00e1g\u00f3 had not wanted to meet with him and had refused to give a sample . On the contrary K\u0151v\u00e1g\u00f3 could be able to prove with call registry that that period the controller did not made any attempt to search for him . The standpoint of the Hungarian Anti-Doping Committee was that the athlete is innocent and the charge does not hold and together with the Hungarian Olympic Committee and the Hungarian Athletics Association they dispensed the athlete after their investigation . The IAAF did not accept this , thus the Hungarian Athletics Association appealed to the CAS ( International Sport Court ) and fully supported the athlete arguing all the evidence contradicts the controller 's word .
