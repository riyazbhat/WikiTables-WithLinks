  "/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857": "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major , but ultimately unsuccessful , uprising in India in 1857-58 against the rule of the British East India Company , which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown . The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company 's army in the garrison town of Meerut , 40 mi ( 64 km ) northeast of Delhi ( now Old Delhi ) . It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India , [ a ] [ b ] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east . [ c ] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region , [ d ] and was contained only with the rebels ' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858 . On 1 November 1858 , the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder , though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859 . Its name is contested , variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny , the Indian Mutiny , the Great Rebellion , the Revolt of 1857 , the Indian Insurrection , and the First War of Independence . [ e ] The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions , including invasive British-style social reforms , harsh land taxes , summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes , as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule . [ f ] Many Indians rose against the British ; however , many also fought for the British , and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule . [ g ] Violence , which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty , was inflicted on both sides , on British officers , and civilians , including women and children , by the rebels , and on the rebels , and their supporters , including sometimes entire villages , by British reprisals ; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation . [ h ] After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut , the rebels quickly reached Delhi , whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah Zafar , was declared the Emperor of Hindustan . Soon , the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh ( Oudh ) . The East India Company 's response came rapidly as well .",

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

The two main gateways on the North West Frontier are the Khyber and Bolan Passes . Since ancient times , the Indian subcontinent has been repeatedly invaded through these northwestern routes . With the expansion of the Russian Empire into Central Asia in the twentieth century , stability of the Frontier and control of Afghanistan became cornerstones of defensive strategy for British India . Much of the Frontier was occupied by Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century , and then taken over by the East India Company when it annexed the Punjab in 1849 . Between 1849 and 1947 the military history of the frontier was a succession of punitive expeditions against offending Pashtun ( or Pathan ) tribes , punctuated by three wars against Afghanistan . Many British officers who went on to distinguished command in the First and Second World Wars learnt their soldiering on the North-West Frontier , which they called the Grim .",

The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries .

The government of the de facto state of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to the former British Somaliland protectorate , which , in the form of the briefly independent State of Somaliland , united as scheduled on 1 July 1960 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland ( the former Italian Somaliland ) to form the Somali Republic . Somaliland lies in northwestern Somalia , on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden . It is bordered by the remainder of Somalia ( per international recognition ) to the east , Djibouti to the northwest , and Ethiopia to the south and west . Its claimed territory has an area of 176,120 square kilometres ( 68,000 sq mi ) , with approximately 4 million residents . The capital and the largest city is Hargeisa , with the population of around 1,500,000 residents . In 1988 , the Siad Barre government began a crackdown against the Hargeisa-based Somali National Movement ( SNM ) and other militant groups , which were among the events that led to the Somali Civil War . The conflict left the country 's economic and military infrastructure severely damaged . Following the collapse of Barre 's government in early 1991 , local authorities , led by the SNM , unilaterally declared independence from Somalia on 18 May of the same year and reinstated the borders of the former short-lived independent State of Somaliland .

  "/wiki/British_expedition_to_Tibet": "The British expedition to Tibet , also known as the British invasion of Tibet or the Younghusband expedition to Tibet began in December 1903 and lasted until September 1904 . The expedition was effectively a temporary invasion by British Indian forces under the auspices of the Tibet Frontier Commission , whose purported mission was to establish diplomatic relations and resolve the dispute over the border between Tibet and Sikkim . In the nineteenth century , the British conquered Burma and Sikkim , occupying the whole southern flank of Tibet . The Tibetan Ganden Phodrang regime , which was then under administrative rule of the Qing dynasty , remained the only Himalayan state free of British influence . The expedition was intended to counter Russia 's perceived ambitions in the East and was initiated largely by Lord Curzon , the head of the British India government . Curzon had long obsessed over Russia 's advance into Central Asia and now feared a Russian invasion of British India . In April 1903 , the British received clear assurances from the Russian government that it had no interest in Tibet . In spite , however , of the Russian assurances , Lord Curzon continued to press for the dispatch of a mission to Tibet , a high level British political officer noted . The expedition fought its way to Gyantse and eventually reached Lhasa , the capital of Tibet , in August 1904 . The Dalai Lama had fled to safety , first in Mongolia and later in China , but thousands of Tibetans armed with antiquated muzzle-loaders and swords had been mown down by modern rifles and Maxim machine guns while attempting to block the British advance . At Lhasa , the Commission forced remaining Tibetan officials to sign the Treaty of Lhasa ( 1904 ) , before withdrawing to Sikkim in September , with the understanding the Chinese government would not permit any other country to interfere with the administration of Tibet . The mission was recognized as a military expedition by the British Indian government , which issued a campaign medal , the Tibet Medal , to all those who took part .",

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa , Tamang , Qiang , Sherpa , and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people . Tibet is the highest region on Earth , with an average elevation of 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain , rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level . The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

  "/wiki/Italy": "Italy ( Italian : Italia [ i\u02c8ta\u02d0lja ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Italian Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Italiana [ re\u02c8pubblika ita\u02c8lja\u02d0na ] ) , is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands . Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",
