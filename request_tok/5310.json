  "/wiki/Trofeo_Alcudia": "The Challenge Vuelta Ciclista a Mallorca ( English : Tour of Majorca , Catalan : Challenge Volta Ciclista a Mallorca ) is a series of four ( five until 2012 ) professional one day road bicycle races held on the Spanish island of Mallorca in late January or early February . The event is used as an early season preparatory event by many of the top teams in readiness for the bigger races later in the season . The five races are ranked 1.1 on the UCI Europe Tour . Although the race styles itself as the Tour of Majorca it has never been allowed to be classed as a multi day stage race by the sports governing body the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) because the race rules allows riders not to participate on certain days if they dont want to . However , there is an unofficial overall classification winner taken on total time over five days . This laid back attitude by the race organisers makes the race popular with team managers who can bring a large squad ( sometimes as many as 20 riders ) and interchange them over the five days . Apart from the overall classification on time there are the usual Mountains , Points and Sprints competitions associated with any stage race . There is also a competition for the top Majorcan based rider , in the past this has been won by Vicente Reyn\u00e8s , Antonio Col\u00f3m and Antonio Tauler . The first day of racing is the Trofeo Mallorca which is a criterium ( circuit race ) around the streets of Palma . The second day is the Trofeo Cala Millor , sometimes called the Trofeo Alc\u00fadia . These two opening days are run over a fairly flat course and result in a sprint finish . The Trofeo Pollen\u00e7a ( day three ) and Trofeo S\u00f3ller ( day four ) are contested over a more hilly course using the climbs of the Col de S\u00f3ller ( 501 metres ) and the Col de Puig Major ( 850 metres ) amongst others on the route .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) .

Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

The event is nicknamed The Race to the Sun , as it runs in the first half of March , typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the C\u00f4te dAzur .

The most successful rider is Ireland 's Sean Kelly , who claimed seven consecutive victories in the 1980s . During the 2003 edition , Kazakh rider Andrey Kivilev died as a result of a head injury sustained in a crash . His death prompted UCI to mandate the use of helmets in all competitions of cycling , except for the last part of a race with an uphill finish . The rule was later changed to require helmets at all times .",
