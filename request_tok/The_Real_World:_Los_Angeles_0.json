As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations , Washington is an important world political capital . The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast .

  "/wiki/In_Living_Color": "In Living Color is an American sketch comedy television series that originally ran on Fox from April 15 , 1990 to May 19 , 1994 . Keenen Ivory Wayans created , wrote and starred in the program . The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood , California . The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented in living color during the 1960s , prior to mainstream color television . It also refers to the fact that most of the show 's cast was black , unlike other sketch comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live , whose casts are mostly white . It was controversial due to the Wayans ' decision to portray black humor from the ghetto in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as The Cosby Show , causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans . Other members of the Wayans family - Damon , Kim , Shawn , and Marlon - had regular roles , while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra . The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors , including Jamie Foxx , Jim Carrey , Tommy Davidson , David Alan Grier , and T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h .

The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety , Music or Comedy Series in 1990 . The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live , special episode as a counterprogram for the halftime show of U.S. leader CBS 's live telecast of Super Bowl XXVI , prompting the National Football League to book A-list acts for future game entertainment , starting with Michael Jackson the following year .",

They are often bound together by shared social characteristics such as ethnicity and socioeconomic status . Examples of common or stereotypical adolescent cliques include athletes , nerds , and outsiders . Typically , people in a clique will not have a completely open friend group , and can therefore ban members if they do something considered unacceptable , such as talking to someone disliked .

  "/wiki/Nicotine": "Nicotine is a stimulant and potent parasympathomimetic alkaloid that is naturally produced in the nightshade family of plants . It is used for the treatment of tobacco use disorders as a smoking cessation aid and nicotine dependence for the relief of withdrawal symptoms . Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) , except at two nicotinic receptor subunits ( nAChR\u03b19 and nAChR\u03b110 ) where it acts as a receptor antagonist . Nicotine constitutes approximately 0.6-3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco . Usually consistent concentrations of nicotine varying from 2-7 \u00b5g/kg ( 20-70 millionths of a percent wet weight ) are found in the edible family Solanaceae , such as potatoes , tomatoes , and eggplant . Some research indicates that the contribution of nicotine obtained from food is substantial in comparison to inhalation of second-hand smoke . Others consider nicotine obtained from food to be trivial unless exceedingly high amounts of certain vegetables are eaten . It functions as an antiherbivore chemical ; consequently , nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past , and neonicotinoids , such as imidacloprid , are widely used . Nicotine is highly addictive . It is one of the most commonly abused drugs . An average cigarette yields about 2 mg of absorbed nicotine ; high amounts can be more harmful . Nicotine addiction involves drug-reinforced behavior , compulsive use , and relapse following abstinence .",

  "/wiki/R&B": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",

  "/wiki/Buddhism": "Buddhism ( /\u02c8b\u028ad\u026az\u0259m/ , US : /\u02c8bu\u02d0d-/ ) is the world 's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers , or over 7% of the global population , known as Buddhists . [ web 1 ] Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies . It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE , spreading through much of Asia . Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars : Theravada ( Pali : The School of the Elders ) and Mahayana ( Sanskrit : The Great Vehicle ) . Most Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth , either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood . Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation , the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts , and their specific teachings and practices . Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangha , observance of moral precepts , monasticism , meditation , and the cultivation of the Paramitas ( perfections , or virtues ) . Theravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Thailand . Mahayana , which includes the traditions of Pure Land , Zen , Nichiren Buddhism , Shingon and Tiantai ( Tendai ) , is found throughout East Asia . Vajrayana , a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts , may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism . Tibetan Buddhism , which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India , is practised in the countries of the Himalayan region , Mongolia , and Kalmykia .",

  "/wiki/Abortion": "Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus . [ note 1 ] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion . When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy , it is called an induced abortion , or less frequently induced miscarriage . The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion . A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a late termination of pregnancy or less accurately as a late term abortion . When properly done , abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine , but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death , especially in the developing world . Making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths . It is safer than childbirth , which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States . Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions . The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy . The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device . Birth control , such as the pill or intrauterine devices , can be used immediately following abortion .",

  "/wiki/Alternative_rock": "Alternative rock ( also called alternative music , alt-rock , alt-pop or simply alternative ) is a term used to categorize rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1980s . In this instance , the word alternative refers to the genre 's distinction from mainstream , or commercial rock or pop music . The term 's original meaning was broader , referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent , DIY ethos of punk rock , which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music . In September of 1988 , Billboard magazine introduced Alternative Songs into their charting system rather than continue incorporating these artists into the existing rock and pop charts . By then alternative had become a catch-all description for both successful artists ( e.g . U2 and R.E.M . ) , as well as music from underground , independent , or non-commercial rock artists that received some level of mainstream recognition . Although the genre evolved in the late 1970s and 1980s , music anticipating the sound of the genre can be found as early as the 1960s , with bands such as the Velvet Underground and artists such as Syd Barrett . Since the early 1990s the term has often been misused to market an artist 's image or music toward consumers seeking to distinguish their tastes from mainstream pop or rock music . Traditionally , alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound , social context and regional roots . Throughout the 1980s , magazines and zines , college radio airplay , and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock , helping to define a number of distinct styles ( and music scenes ) such as noise pop , indie rock , grunge , and shoegaze . Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands , such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and R.E.M. , were signed to major labels .",

  "/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous": "Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) is an international mutual aid fellowship with the stated purpose of enabling its members to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety . AA is nonprofessional , self-supporting , and apolitical . Its only membership requirement is a desire to stop drinking . The AA program of recovery is set forth in the Twelve Steps . AA was founded in Akron , Ohio when in 1935 one alcoholic , Bill Wilson , talked to another alcoholic , Bob Smith , about the nature of alcoholism and a possible solution . With the help of other early members , the book Alcoholics Anonymous : The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism was written in 1939 . Its title became the name of the organization and is now usually referred to as The Big Book . AA 's initial Twelve Traditions were introduced in 1946 to help the fellowship be stable and unified while disengaged from outside issues and influences . The Traditions recommend that members remain anonymous in public media , altruistically help other alcoholics , and that AA groups avoid official affiliations with other organizations . They also advise against dogma and coercive hierarchies . Subsequent fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous have adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes . AA membership has since spread internationally across diverse cultures holding different beliefs and values , including geopolitical areas resistant to grassroots movements ."
