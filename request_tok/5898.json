  "/wiki/Concordat_of_London": "The Investiture Controversy or Investiture Contest was a conflict between church and state in medieval Europe over the ability to install high church officials through investiture . By undercutting imperial power , the controversy led to nearly 50 years of civil war in Germany . According to historian Norman Cantor , the Investiture Controversy was the turning-point in medieval civilization , marking the end of the Early Middle Ages with the Germanic peoples ' final and decisive acceptance of Christianity . More importantly , it set the stage for the religious and political system of the High Middle Ages . It began as a power struggle between Pope Gregory VII and Emperor Henry IV in 1076 . There was also a brief but significant investiture struggle between Pope Paschal II and King Henry I of England from 1103 to 1107 . The conflict ended in 1122 , when Pope Callixtus II and Emperor Henry V agreed on the Concordat of Worms , which differentiated between the royal and spiritual powers and gave the emperors a limited role in selecting bishops . The outcome was largely a papal victory , but the Emperor still retained considerable power .",
  "/wiki/Henry_I_of_England": "Henry I ( c. 1068 - 1 December 1135 ) , also known as Henry Beauclerc , was King of England from 1100 to his death in 1135 . He was the fourth son of William the Conqueror and was educated in Latin and the liberal arts . On William 's death in 1087 , Henry 's elder brothers Robert Curthose and William Rufus inherited Normandy and England , respectively , but Henry was left landless . He purchased the County of Cotentin in western Normandy from Robert , but his brothers deposed him in 1091 . He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert . Present at the place where his brother William died in a hunting accident in 1100 , Henry seized the English throne , promising at his coronation to correct many of William 's less popular policies . He married Matilda of Scotland and they had two surviving children , William Adelin and Empress Matilda ; he also had many illegitimate children by his many mistresses . Robert , who invaded in 1101 , disputed Henry 's control of England ; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king . The peace was short-lived , and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106 , finally defeating Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray . Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life . Henry 's control of Normandy was challenged by Louis VI of France , Baldwin VII of Flanders and Fulk V of Anjou , who promoted the rival claims of Robert 's son , William Clito , and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119 . Following Henry 's victory at the Battle of Br\u00e9mule , a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120 .",
  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England .

In Emperor Henry IV 's conflicts with the imperial princes and the struggle against the reform papacy , young Henry V allied himself with the opponents of his father . He forced Henry IV to abdicate on 31 December 1105 and ruled for five years in compliance with the imperial princes . He tried , unsuccessfully , to withdraw the regalia from the bishops and in order to at least preserve the previous right to invest he captured Pope Paschal II and forced him to perform his imperial coronation in 1111 . Once crowned emperor , Henry departed from joint rule with the princes and resorted to earlier Salian autocratic rule . After he had failed to increase control over the church , the princes in Saxony and on the Middle and Lower Rhine , in 1121 the imperial princes forced Henry V to consent with the papacy .

Pope Innocent was one of the most powerful and influential of the medieval popes . He exerted a wide influence over the Christian states of Europe , claiming supremacy over all of Europe 's kings . He was central in supporting the Catholic Church 's reforms of ecclesiastical affairs through his decretals and the Fourth Lateran Council . This resulted in a considerable refinement of Western canon law . He is furthermore notable for using interdict and other censures to compel princes to obey his decisions , although these measures were not uniformly successful . Innocent greatly extended the scope of the crusades , directing crusades against Muslim Spain and the Holy Land as well as the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in southern France . He organized the Fourth Crusade of 1202-1204 , which ended in the disastrous sack of Constantinople . Although the attack on Constantinople went against his explicit orders , and the Crusaders were subsequently excommunicated , Innocent reluctantly accepted this result , seeing it as the will of God to reunite the Latin and Orthodox Churches . In the event , the sack of Constantinople and the subsequent period of Frankokratia heightened the hostility between the Latin and Greek churches .

The term derives from the name given by the Orthodox Greeks to the Western European Latin Church Catholics : rule of the Franks or Latins . The span of the Frankokratia period differs by region : the political situation proved highly volatile , as the Frankish states fragmented and changed hands , and the Greek successor states re-conquered many areas . With the exception of the Ionian Islands , Crete and some islands or forts which remained in Venetian hands until the turn of the 19th century , the final end of the Frankokratia in most of Greek lands came with the Ottoman conquest , chiefly in the 14th to 16th centuries , which ushered in the period known as Tourkokratia ( rule of the Turks ; see Ottoman Greece ) .",

  "/wiki/Concordats_of_Constance": "The Concordats of Constance were five agreements between the Catholic Church and the nations of England ( including Scotland ) , France , Germany ( including Scandinavia and eastern Europe ) , Italy ( Imperial Italy , the Papal States , Naples , Sicily , and the Venetian Republic ) and Spain ( Aragon , Castile , Navarre and Portugal ) in the aftermath of the Council of Constance ( 1414-18 ) that ended the Western Schism . The French and German concordats were signed on 15 April 1418 , the Spanish on 13 May and the English on 12 July . The Italian agreement is lost . The delegates to the council had sat as five nations - England , France , Germany , Italy and Spain - each with one vote . On 21 March 1418 , the concordats were approved in advance by the council as conforming to and fulfilling the decrees of 30 October 1417 . The issues dealt with in the concordats were of relatively minor importance and were unconnected to the reform movement in the church . Their chief importance lies in the fact that , together with the seven reform statutes of Pope Martin V , they settled all outstanding issues and brought the papal schism to an end . While the English concordat was perpetual , the French and German concordats had a term of five years ( that is , they expired in 1423 ) , since the French and Germans agreed to remit annates to the papacy only until it was firmly established and could live off its own revenues The English concordat limited the granting of papal dispensations for holding a plurality of benefices to men of noble birth or high scholarship . No such grants would be issued as favours for the courtiers of secular or ecclesiastical lords . Dispensations allowing clerics to live away from their benefices or allowing laymen to hold benefices for grace periods before taking holy orders were revoked . The appropriation of benefices for the use of monasteries , collegiate churches or cathedral chapters was prohibited without the approval of the local bishop . For a long time , it was thought that concordats had been signed with the Spanish and Italian nations , but that the texts had been lost .",

In the midst of the Hundred Years ' War , Charles VII inherited the throne of France under desperate circumstances . Forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France , including Paris , the most populous city , and Reims , the city in which the French kings were traditionally crowned . In addition , his father Charles VI had disinherited him in 1420 and recognized Henry V of England and his heirs as the legitimate successors to the French crown instead . At the same time , a civil war raged in France between the Armagnacs ( supporters of the House of Valois ) and the Burgundian party ( supporters of the House of Valois-Burgundy allied to the English ) . With his court removed to Bourges , south of the Loire River , Charles was disparagingly called the King of Bourges , because the area around this city was one of the few remaining regions left to him . However , his political and military position improved dramatically with the emergence of Joan of Arc as a spiritual leader in France . Joan of Arc and other charismatic figures led French troops to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans , as well as other strategic cities on the Loire river , and to crush the English at the battle of Patay . With the local English troops dispersed , the people of Reims switched allegiance and opened their gates , which enabled the coronation of Charles VII in 1429 at Reims Cathedral . A few years later he ended the English-Burgundian alliance by signing the Treaty of Arras in 1435 , followed by the recovery of Paris in 1436 and the steady reconquest of Normandy in the 1440s using a newly organized professional army and advanced siege cannons . Following the battle of Castillon in 1453 , the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais .

  "/wiki/Concordat_of_Bologna": "The Concordat of Bologna ( 1516 ) , marking a stage in the evolution of the Gallican Church , was an agreement between King Francis I of France and Pope Leo X that Francis negotiated in the wake of his victory at Marignano in September 1515 . The groundwork was laid in a series of personal meetings of king and pope in Bologna , 11-15 December 1515 . The concordat was signed in Rome on 18 August 1516 . The Concordat explicitly superseded the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges ( 1438 ) , which had proved ineffective in guaranteeing the privileges of the Church in France , where bishoprics and abbacies had been wrangled over even before the Parlement of Paris : hardly anywhere were elections held in due form , R. Aubenas observes , for the king succeeded in foisting his own candidates upon the electors by every conceivable means , not excluding the most ruthless . The Concordat permitted the Pope to collect all the income that the Catholic Church made in France , and the King of France was confirmed in his right to tithe the clerics and to restrict their right of appeal to Rome . The Concordat confirmed the King of France 's right to nominate appointments to benefice ( archbishops , bishops , abbots and priors ) , enabling the Crown , by controlling its personnel , to decide who was to lead the Gallican Church . Canonical installation of those church officers was reserved to the Pope ; thus the agreement confirmed the papal veto of any leader the King of France chose who might be deemed truly unqualified . The Concordat confirmed the Apostolic Camera 's right to collect annates , the first year 's revenue from each benefice , a right that when abused led to shuffling of prelates among dioceses . The fiction of elections to bishopric by canons and to abbacies by monks was discontinued . On Francis 's part , it was at last firmly conceded that the Pope 's powers were not subject to any council ( the previous French position had been to support the decisions of the Council of Basel ) , an affirmation of the papal position in the long-crushed Conciliar Movement , which was in the process of being condemned at the contemporaneous Fifth Lateran Council ( 1512-17 ) , which confirmed the Concordat .",

Born into the prominent political and banking Medici family of Florence , Giovanni was the second son of Lorenzo de ' Medici , ruler of the Florentine Republic , and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1489 . Following the death of Pope Julius II , Giovanni was elected pope after securing the backing of the younger members of the Sacred College . Early on in his rule he oversaw the closing sessions of the Fifth Council of the Lateran , but struggled to implement the reforms agreed . In 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as Duke of Urbino , but which reduced papal finances . In Protestant circles , Leo is associated with granting indulgences for those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter 's Basilica , a practice that was soon challenged by Martin Luther 's 95 Theses . He refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the demands of what would become the Protestant Reformation , and his Papal Bull of 1520 , Exsurge Domine , condemned Martin Luther 's condemnatory stance , rendering ongoing communication difficult . He borrowed and spent money without circumspection and was a significant patron of the arts . Under his reign , progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter 's Basilica and artists such as Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms . Leo also reorganised the Roman University , and promoted the study of literature , poetry and antiquities . He died in 1521 and is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva , Rome .

A prodigious patron of the arts , he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , including Leonardo da Vinci , who brought the Mona Lisa with him , which Francis had acquired . Francis ' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France , the spread of humanism and Protestantism , and the beginning of French exploration of the New World . Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire .

He was also known as Fran\u00e7ois du Grand Nez ( Francis of the Large Nose ) , the Grand Colas , and the Roi-Chevalier ( the Knight-King ) for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival Emperor Charles V , who was also King of Spain . Following the policy of his predecessors , Francis continued the Italian Wars . The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands , the throne of Spain , and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy . In his struggle against Imperial hegemony , he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold .

With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
  "/wiki/Concordat_of_1801": "The Concordat of 1801 was an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII , signed on 15 July 1801 in Paris . It remained in effect until 1905 . It sought national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics and solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France , with most of its civil status restored . The hostility of devout French Catholics against the state had then largely been resolved . It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized upon during the revolution and sold off . Catholic clergy returned from exile , or from hiding , and resumed their traditional positions in their traditional churches . Very few parishes continued to employ the priests who had accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of the Revolutionary regime . While the Concordat restored much power to the papacy , the balance of church-state relations tilted firmly in Napoleon 's favour . He selected the bishops and supervised church finances . Napoleon and the pope both found the Concordat useful . Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon , especially Italy and Germany .",

Chiaramonti was also a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict in addition to being a well-known theologian and bishop throughout his life . Chiaramonti was made Bishop of Tivoli in 1782 , and resigned that position upon his appointment as Bishop of Imola in 1785 . That same year , he was made a cardinal . In 1789 , the French Revolution took place , and as a result a series of anti-clerical governments came into power in the country . In 1796 , during the French Revolutionary Wars , French troops under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Rome and took as prisoner Pope Pius VI . He was taken as prisoner to France , where he died in 1799 . The following year , after a sede vacante period lasting approximately six months , Chiaramonti was elected to the papacy , taking the name Pius VII . Pius at first attempted to take a cautious approach in dealing with Napoleon . With him he signed the Concordat of 1801 , through which he succeeded in guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics living in France , and was present at his coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804 . In 1809 , however , during the Napoleonic Wars , Napoleon once again invaded the Papal States , resulting in his excommunication . Pius VII was taken prisoner and transported to France .",

He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days . Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars . He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815 . He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history , and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . Napoleon 's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history . He was born Napoleone Buonaparte ( Italian : [ napole\u02c8o\u02d0ne \u02ccbw\u0254na\u02c8parte ] ) in Corsica to a relatively modest Italian family from minor nobility . He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789 . He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military , seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24 . The French Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed the 13 Vend\u00e9miaire revolt against the government from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs - winning virtually every battle , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing sister republics with local support , and becoming a war hero in France . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power .",
