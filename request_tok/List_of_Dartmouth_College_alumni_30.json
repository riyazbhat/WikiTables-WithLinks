  "/wiki/Oregon_Country": "In the nineteenth century , the Oregon Country was a disputed region of the Pacific Northwest of North America . The region was occupied by British and French Canadian fur traders from before 1810 , and American settlers from the mid-1830s , with its coastal areas north from the Columbia River frequented by ships from all nations engaged in the maritime fur trade , most of these from the 1790s through 1810s being Boston-based . The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended disputed joint occupancy pursuant to the Treaty of 1818 and established the British-American boundary at the 49th parallel ( except Vancouver Island ) . [ citation needed ] Oregon was a distinctly American term for the region . The British used the term Columbia District instead . The Oregon Country consisted of the land north of 42\u00b0N latitude , south of 54\u00b040\u2032N latitude , and west of the Rocky Mountains - with the eastern border generally running on or close to the Continental Divide - westwards to the Pacific Ocean . The area now forms part of the present day Canadian province of British Columbia , all of the US states of Oregon , Washington , and Idaho , and parts of Montana and Wyoming . The British presence in the region was generally administered by the Hudson 's Bay Company , whose Columbia Department comprised most of the Oregon Country and extended considerably north into New Caledonia and beyond 54\u00b040\u2032N , with operations reaching tributaries of the Yukon River",
  "/wiki/Nathaniel_Jarvis_Wyeth": "Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth ( January 29 , 1802 - August 31 , 1856 ) was an American inventor and businessman in Boston , Massachusetts who contributed greatly to its ice industry . Due to his inventions , Boston could harvest and ship ice internationally . In the 1830s , he was also a mountain man who led two expeditions to the Northwest and set up two trading posts , one in present-day Idaho and one in present-day Oregon . In the 1830s , he became interested in the Northwest and planned an expedition with Hall J. Kelley . In 1832 he proceeded independently , traveling to Fort Vancouver . Two years later in 1834 , he led another expedition , founding Fort Hall in present-day Idaho and Fort William in present-day Portland , Oregon . Unable to succeed commercially against the powerful Hudson 's Bay Company , he sold both fur trading posts to it in 1837 . At the time , both Great Britain and the United States had fur trading companies , settlers and others in the Pacific Northwest . After they settled the northern boundary in 1846 , both forts were considered part of the United States and its territories . After returning to Boston , Wyeth managed his business affairs and amassed a considerable fortune . The Fort Hall site has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is considered the most important trading post in the Snake River Valley through the 1860s . More than 270,000 emigrants reached it while traveling the Oregon Trail",

  "/wiki/Founder_(person)": "Entrepreneurship is the process of designing , launching and running a new business , which is often initially a small business . The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs . Entrepreneurship has been described as the capacity and willingness to develop , organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit . While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses , due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up , a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to lack of funding , bad business decisions , an economic crisis , lack of market demand , or a combination of all of these . A broader definition of the term is sometimes used , especially in the field of economics . In this usage , an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technologies into products and services : The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital , talent , and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation . In this sense , the term Entrepreneurship also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms , in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses . Coming up with an idea for a product or service is not the hardest thing for startups and entrepreneurs . Building a product isnt even the hardest . Truly , the hardest part is making it work , or in other words , getting people to like and want to buy your product , and beating the competition at the same time",

  "/wiki/Poker": "Poker is a family of card games that combines gambling , strategy and different skills . All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play , and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players ' cards , at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand . Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt , the number of shared or community cards , the number of cards that remain hidden , and the betting procedures . In most modern poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet ( the blind or ante ) . In standard poker , each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players . The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match ( or call ) the maximum previous bet , or fold , losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand . A player who matches a bet may also raise ( increase ) the bet . The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded . If all but one player folds on any round , the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand . If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round , a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed , and the player with the winning hand takes the pot . With the exception of initial forced bets , money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons . Thus , while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance , the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability , psychology , and game theory",
  "/wiki/Steve_Russell_(computer_scientist)": "Stephen Steve Russell ( born 1937 ) is an American computer scientist most famous for creating Spacewar ! , one of the earliest video games",
  "/wiki/Spacewar!": "Spacewar ! is a space combat video game developed in 1962 by Steve Russell in collaboration with Martin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen , and programmed by Russell with assistance from other people , including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner . It was written for the newly installed DEC PDP-1 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . After its initial creation , Spacewar was expanded further by other students and employees of universities in the area , including Dan Edwards and Peter Samson . It was also spread to many of the few dozen ( primarily academic ) installations of the PDP-1 computer , making Spacewar the first known video game to be played at multiple computer installations . The game features two spaceships , the needle and the wedge , engaged in a dogfight while maneuvering in the gravity well of a star . Both ships are controlled by human players . Each ship has limited fuel for maneuvering and a limited number of torpedoes , and the ships follow Newtonian physics , remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating . Flying near the star to provide a gravity assist was a common tactic . Ships are destroyed when hit by a torpedo , colliding with the star or colliding with each other . At any time , the player can engage a hyperspace feature to move to a new and random location on the screen , though each use has an increasing chance of destroying the ship instead . The game was initially controlled with switches on the PDP-1 , though Bob Saunders built an early gamepad to reduce the difficulty and awkwardness of controlling the game"
