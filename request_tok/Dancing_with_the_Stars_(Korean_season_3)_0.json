Types of modelling include : fashion , glamour , fitness , bikini , fine art , body-part , promotional , and commercial print models . Models are featured in a variety of media formats including : books , magazines , films , newspapers , internet and television . Fashion models are sometimes featured in films ( Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter and Looker ) ; reality TV shows ( America 's Next Top Model and The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency ) ; and music videos ( Freedom !

Each specific pool game has its own name ; some of the better-known include eight-ball , blackball , nine-ball , ten-ball , seven-ball , straight pool , one-pocket , and bank pool . The generic term pocket billiards is sometimes also used , and favored by some pool-industry bodies , but is technically a broader classification , including games such as snooker , Russian pyramid , and kaisa , which are not referred to as pool games . In most parts of the world , it is commonly referred to as just billiards , analogous to the term bowling being commonly used to refer the game of ten-pin bowling . There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards , such as American four-ball billiards , bottle pool , cowboy pool , and English billiards .",
  "/wiki/Actor": "An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance ( also actress ; see below ) . The actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film , radio , and television .

The actor 's interpretation of their role - the art of acting - pertains to the role played , whether based on a real person or fictional character . Interpretation occurs even when the actor is playing themselves , as in some forms of experimental performance art . Formerly , in ancient Greece and Rome , the medieval world , and the time of William Shakespeare , only men could become actors , and women 's roles were generally played by men or boys . After the English Restoration of 1660 , women began to appear on stage in England . In modern times , particularly in pantomime and some operas , women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men .",

  "/wiki/Basketball_player": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports . The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition . Outside North America , the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas .",

  "/wiki/Rock_music": "Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the United States in the early 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom . It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll , a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues , rhythm and blues , and from country music . Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical styles . Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass , drums , and one or more singers . Usually , rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political . By the late 1960s classic rock period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , southern rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .",
