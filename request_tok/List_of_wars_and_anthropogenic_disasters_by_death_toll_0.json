  "/wiki/Partition_of_India_and_Pakistan": "The Partition of India of 1947 was the division of British India [ b ] into two independent dominion states , the Union of India and the Dominion of Pakistan . The Union of India is today the Republic of India ; the Dominion of Pakistan is today the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People 's Republic of Bangladesh . The partition involved the division of two provinces , Bengal and Punjab , based on district-wise non-Muslim or Muslim majorities . The partition also saw the creation of the British Indian Army , the Royal Indian Navy , the Indian Civil Service , the railways , and the central treasury . The partition was outlined in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj , or Crown rule in India . The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 14-15 August 1947 . The partition displaced between 10-12 million people along religious lines , creating overwhelming refugee crises in the newly constituted dominions ; there was large-scale violence , with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million . [ c ] The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues their relationship to the present . The term partition of India does not cover the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 , nor the earlier separations of Burma ( now Myanmar ) and Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) from the administration of British India . [ d ] The term also does not cover the political integration of princely states into the two new dominions , nor the disputes of annexation or division arising in the princely states of Hyderabad , Junagadh , and Jammu and Kashmir , though violence along religious lines did break out in some princely states at the time of the partition . It does not cover the incorporation of the enclaves of French India into India during the period 1947-1954 , nor the annexation of Goa and other districts of Portuguese India by India in 1961 . Other contemporaneous political entities in the region in 1947 , Sikkim , Bhutan , Nepal , and the Maldives were unaffected by the partition .",

Politically , Bengal is currently divided between Bangladesh ( which covers two-thirds of the region ) and the Indian territories of West Bengal , Tripura and Assam 's Barak Valley ( altogether cover the remaining one-third ) . In 2011 , the population of Bengal was estimated to be 250 million , making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world . Among them , an estimated 160 million people live in Bangladesh and 91.3 million people live in West Bengal . The predominant ethnolinguistic group is the Bengali people , who speak the Indo-Aryan Bengali language . Bengali Muslims are the majority in Bangladesh and Bengali Hindus are the majority in West Bengal and Tripura , while Barak Valley contains almost equal proportions of Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims . Outside Bengal proper , the Indian territories of Jharkhand , Bihar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also home to significant communities of Bengalis . Dense woodlands , including hilly rainforests , cover Bengal 's northern and eastern areas ; while an elevated forested plateau covers its central area . In the littoral southwest are the Sundarbans , the world 's largest mangrove forest and home of the Bengal tiger . In the coastal southeast lies Cox 's Bazar , the longest beach in the world at 125 km ( 78 mi ) . The region has a monsoon climate , which the Bengali calendar divides into six seasons .",
  "/wiki/La_Violencia": "La Violencia ( Spanish pronunciation : [ la \u03b2jo\u02c8lensja ] , The Violence ) was a ten-year civil war in Colombia from 1948 to 1958 , between the Colombian Conservative Party and the Colombian Liberal Party , fought mainly in the countryside . La Violencia is considered to have begun with the 9 April 1948 assassination of the popular politician Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n , a Liberal Party presidential candidate for the election in November 1949 . His murder provoked the Bogotazo rioting that lasted for ten hours and killed some 5,000 people . An alternative historiography proposes as the start the Conservatives ' return to power following the election of 1946 . Rural town police and political leaders encouraged Conservative-supporting peasants to seize the agricultural lands of Liberal-supporting peasants , which provoked peasant-to-peasant violence throughout Colombia . La Violencia is estimated to have cost the lives of at least 200,000 people .",

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa , Tamang , Qiang , Sherpa , and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people . Tibet is the highest region on Earth , with an average elevation of 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain , rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level . The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",

  "/wiki/Byzantine_Empire": "The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantium , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern Istanbul , formerly Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

In 1923 the capital of Turkey , the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , was moved to Ankara and the name Constantinople was officially changed to Istanbul ; the city is still referred to as Constantinople in Greek-speaking sources . The city is located in what is now the European side and the core of modern Istanbul . In 324 the ancient city of Byzantium became the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great , after whom it was renamed , and dedicated on 11 May 330 .

The Franco-Prussian War had led to the capture of Emperor Napoleon III in September 1870 , the collapse of the Second French Empire , and the beginning of the Third Republic . Because Paris was under siege for four months , the Third Republic moved its capital to Tours . A hotbed of working-class radicalism , Paris was primarily defended during this time by the often politicised and radical troops of the National Guard rather than regular Army troops . Paris surrendered to the Prussians on 28 January 1871 , and in February Adolphe Thiers , the new chief executive of the French national government , signed an armistice with Prussia that disarmed the Army but not the National Guard . On 18 March , soldiers of the Commune 's National Guard killed two French army generals , and the Commune refused to accept the authority of the French government . The Commune governed Paris for two months , until it was suppressed by the regular French Army during La semaine sanglante ( The Bloody Week ) beginning on 21 May 1871 . Debates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of Karl Marx , who described it as an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat .",

The number of Taiwanese deaths from the incident and massacre was estimated to be between 5,000 and 28,000 . The massacre marked the beginning of the White Terror in which tens of thousands of other Taiwanese went missing , died or were imprisoned . The incident is one of the most important events in Taiwan 's modern history and was a critical impetus for the Taiwan independence movement . In 1945 , following the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II , the Allies handed administrative control of Taiwan to the Republic of China ( ROC ) , thus ending 50 years of Japanese colonial rule . Local inhabitants became resentful of what they saw as highhanded and frequently corrupt conduct on the part of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) authorities , including arbitrary seizure of private property , economic mismanagement , and exclusion from political participation . The flashpoint came on February 27 , 1947 in Taipei , when agents of the State Monopoly Bureau struck a Taiwanese widow suspected of selling contraband cigarettes . An officer then fired into a crowd of angry bystanders , striking one man who died the next day . Soldiers fired upon demonstrators the next day , after which a radio station was seized and news of the revolt was broadcast to the entire island . As the uprising spread , the KMT-installed governor Chen Yi called for military reinforcements , and the uprising was violently put down by the National Revolutionary Army . For the following 38 years , the island was placed under martial law in a period that would be known as White Terror . During White Terror the KMT persecuted perceived political dissidents and the subject was considered too taboo to be discussed .",

Kronshtadtskoye vosstaniye ) was an insurrection of the Soviet sailors , soldiers and civilians of the port city of Kronstadt against the Bolshevik government of the Russian SFSR . It was the last major revolt against the Bolshevik regime on Russian territory during the Russian Civil War that ravaged the country . The revolt began on March 1 , 1921 in the city 's naval fortress , located on the island of Kotlin in the Gulf of Finland . Traditionally , Kronstadt served as the base of the Russian Baltic fleet and as defense for the approaches to Petrograd , located 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) from the island . For sixteen days , the rebels rose in opposition to the Soviet government they had helped to consolidate . Led by Stepan Petrichenko , the rebels , including many Communists disappointed in the direction of the Bolshevik government , demanded a series of reforms , such as the election of new soviets , the inclusion of socialist parties and anarchist groups in the new soviets , and the end of the Bolshevik monopoly on power , economic freedom for peasants and workers , dissolution of the bureaucratic organs of government created during the civil war , and the restoration of civil rights for the working class . Despite the influence of some opposition parties , the sailors did not support any in particular . Convinced of the popularity of the reforms they were fighting for ( which they partially tried to implement during the revolt ) , the Kronstadt seamen waited in vain for the support of the population in the rest of the country and rejected aid from emigrants . Although the council of officers advocated a more offensive strategy , the rebels maintained a passive attitude as they waited for the government to take the first step in negotiations , which eventually isolated continental forces . The authorities , by contrast , took an uncompromising stance , presenting an ultimatum demanding unconditional surrender on March 5 . Once the surrender period expired , the Bolsheviks sent a series of military raids against the island , managing to suppress the revolt on March 17 , causing the deaths of several thousands in the process .",

There was graffiti , barricading , and widespread throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails at the IDF and its infrastructure within the West Bank and Gaza Strip . These contrasted with civil efforts including general strikes , boycotts of Israeli Civil Administration institutions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , an economic boycott consisting of refusal to work in Israeli settlements on Israeli products , refusal to pay taxes , and refusal to drive Palestinian cars with Israeli licenses . Israel deployed some 80,000 soldiers in response . Israeli countermeasures , which initially included the use of live rounds frequently in cases of riots , were criticized as disproportionate .

  "/wiki/Santa_Mar\u00eda_School_massacre": "The Santa Mar\u00eda School massacre was a massacre of striking workers , mostly saltpeter works ( nitrate ) miners , along with wives and children , committed by the Chilean Army in Iquique , Chile on December 21 , 1907 . The number of victims is undetermined but is estimated by various sources at between 2,000 and 3,600 . It occurred during the peak of the nitrate mining era , which coincided with the Parliamentary Period in Chilean political history ( 1891-1925 ) . With the massacre and an ensuing reign of terror , not only was the strike broken , but the workers ' movement was thrown into limbo for over a decade . For decades afterward there was official suppression of knowledge of the incident , but in 2007 the government conducted a highly publicized commemoration of its centenary , including an official national day of mourning and the reinterment of the victims ' remains . The site of the massacre was the Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda School , [ a ] where thousands of miners from different nitrate mines in Chile 's far north had been camping for a week after converging on Iquique , the regional capital , to appeal for government intervention to improve their living and working conditions . Rafael Sotomayor Gaete , the minister of the interior , decided to crush the strike , by army assault if need be . On December 21 , 1907 , the commander of the troops at the scene , General Roberto Silva Renard , in accordance with this plan , informed the strikers ' leaders that the strikers had one hour to disband or be fired upon . When the time was up and the leaders and the multitude stood firm , General Silva Renard gave his troops the order to fire . An initial volley that felled the negotiators was followed by a hail of rifle and machine gun fire aimed at the multitude of strikers and their accompanying wives and children .",
  "/wiki/Chile": "Chile ( /\u02c8t\u0283\u026ali/ ( listen ) , /\u02c8t\u0283\u026ale\u026a/ ; Spanish : [ \u02c8t\u0283ile ] ) , [ nb 2 ] officially the Republic of Chile ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica de Chile ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a South American country occupying a long , narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west . It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",
