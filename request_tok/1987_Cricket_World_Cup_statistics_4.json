  "/wiki/Mohammad_Azharuddin": "Mohammad Azharuddin is an Indian politician , former cricketer who was the Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha from Moradabad . He was renowned as an elegant middle-order batsman and captain of the Indian cricket team in 47 tests and 174 one day matches during the 1990s . His international playing career came to an end when he was found to be involved in a match-fixing scandal in 2000 and subsequently banned by the BCCI for life . In 2012 , the Andhra Pradesh High Court declared the life ban illegal . A division bench of the high court set aside the order of the City Civil Court , which had upheld the ban after Azharuddin had challenged it . But by then he was 49 years old and too old to get back on the pitch . He said he was happy the issue was over and done with , and he would not be taking any further legal action : It was a long drawn out legal case and it was painful . We fought in the court for 11 years . Finally the verdict has come and I am happy that the ban has been lifted by the court . I am not going to take any legal action against any authority and I do n't want to blame anybody for this also . Whatever had to happen has happened . I do n't have any complaint",
