  "/wiki/Easter_Island": "Easter Island ( Rapa Nui : Rapa Nui , Spanish : Isla de Pascua ) is an island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean , at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania . Easter Island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues , called moai , created by the early Rapa Nui people . In 1995 , UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site , with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park . It is believed that Easter Island 's Polynesian inhabitants arrived on Easter Island sometime near 1200 AD . They created a thriving and industrious culture , as evidenced by the island 's numerous enormous stone moai and other artifacts . However , land clearing for cultivation and the introduction of the Polynesian rat led to gradual deforestation . By the time of European arrival in 1722 , the island 's population was estimated to be 2,000-3,000 . European diseases , Peruvian slave raiding expeditions in the 1860s , and emigration to other islands , e.g . Tahiti , further depleted the population , reducing it to a low of 111 native inhabitants in 1877 . Chile annexed Easter Island in 1888 . In 1966 , the Rapa Nui were granted Chilean citizenship .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

The islands are known for their large number of endemic species and were studied by Charles Darwin during the second voyage of HMS Beagle . His observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin 's theory of evolution by means of natural selection . The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and their surrounding waters form the Gal\u00e1pagos Province of Ecuador , the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park , and the Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve . The principal language on the islands is Spanish . The islands have a population of slightly over 25,000 . The first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535 , when Fray Tom\u00e1s de Berlanga , the Bishop of Panam\u00e1 , was surprised with this undiscovered land during a voyage to Peru to arbitrate in a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro . De Berlanga eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them . The group of islands was shown and named in Abraham Ortelius 's atlas published in 1570 . The first crude map of the islands was made in 1684 by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley , who named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after British royalty and noblemen . These names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the Beagle survey under captain Robert FitzRoy , and in Darwin 's popular book The Voyage of the Beagle . The new Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832 , and subsequently gave them official Spanish names .",

French Polynesia was an overseas territory until the constitutional reform on 28 March 2003 created the overseas collectivities . Then , on 27 February 2004 a law was passed giving French Polynesia the particular designation of overseas country while recalling that it belongs to the category of overseas collectivities . However , the Constitutional Council of France ruled that this description was merely a designation and not a legal status , as that would have been unconstitutional . The territory 's new status meant a certain autonomy for French Polynesia in the Pacific region . This translated into the transfer of new areas of legal responsibility ( civil law , commercial law , labour law ) while protecting existing autonomy in the fields of health , development and town planning and the environment . In addition , French Polynesia gained the power to oppose the application of laws voted by the French Parliament that do not respect these areas of responsibility . Furthermore , it established French Polynesian citizenship based on permanent residency - a requirement for the right to vote in regional elections . However , France maintains control over justice , security and public order , currency , defence , and foreign policy .

Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
  "/wiki/Bonin_Islands": "The Bonin Islands , also known as the Ogasawara Islands ( \u5c0f\u7b20\u539f\u7fa4\u5cf6 , Ogasawara Gunt\u014d ) , or , Yslas del Arzobispo , are an archipelago of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands , some 1,000 kilometres ( 540 nmi ; 620 mi ) directly south of Tokyo , Japan . The name Bonin Islands comes from the Japanese word bunin ( an archaic reading of \u7121\u4eba mujin ) , meaning no people or uninhabited . The only inhabited islands of the group are Chichijima ( \u7236\u5cf6 ) , the seat of the municipal government , and Hahajima ( \u6bcd\u5cf6 ) . Ogasawara Municipality ( mura ) and Ogasawara Subprefecture take their names from the Ogasawara Group . Ogasawara Archipelago ( \u5c0f\u7b20\u539f\u8af8\u5cf6 , Ogasawara shot\u014d ) is also used as a wider collective term that includes other islands in Ogasawara Municipality , such as the Volcano Islands , along with three other remote islands ( Nishinoshima , Minami-Tori-shima and Okinotorishima ) . Geographically speaking , all of these islands are part of the Nanp\u014d Islands . A total population of 2,440 ( 2015 ) , 2,000 on Chichijima and 440 on Hahajima , lives in the Ogasawara Group , which has a total area of 84 square kilometres ( 32 sq mi ) . Because the Ogasawara Islands have never been connected to a continent , many of their animals and plants have undergone unique evolutionary processes . This has led to the islands ' nickname of The Gal\u00e1pagos of the Orient , and their nomination as a natural World Heritage Site on June 24 , 2011 . The giant squid ( genus Architeuthis ) was photographed off the Ogasawara Islands for the first time in the wild on 30 September 2004 , and was filmed alive in December 2006 . A 25-metre-diameter ( 82 ft ) radio telescope is located in Chichijima , one of the stations of the very-long-baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) Exploration of Radio Astrometry ( VERA ) project , and is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan .",
  "/wiki/Japanese_language": "Japanese ( \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e , Nihongo [ \u0272iho\u014b\u0261o ] ( listen ) ) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people , primarily in Japan , where it is the national language . It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",

It has also been known as Rosario Island . Originally the above-water part of the ridge of an underwater caldera , Nishinoshima was enlarged in 1974 after fresh eruptions created a new section of the island . Another eruption that began in November 2013 further enlarged the island and attracted worldwide attention . A volcanic cone soon formed , raising to an estimated height of 142 m ( 466 ft ) by July 2016 . The eruptions ceased by November 2015 , though emissions of volcanic gases continued for several months afterwards . As of 2016 , the island was about 2.7 km2 ( 1.0 sq mi ) in size and evinces the return of various plants and animal species . There were further eruptions in 2017 , 2018 and 2019 .

Most Indonesians , aside from speaking the national language , are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous local languages ; examples include Javanese , Sundanese and Balinese , which are commonly used at home and within the local community . However , most formal education , and nearly all national mass media , governance , administration , judiciary , and other forms of communication , are conducted in Indonesian . The term Indonesian is primarily associated with the national standard dialect ( bahasa baku ) . However , in a more loose sense , it also encompasses the various local varieties spoken throughout the Indonesian archipelago . Standard Indonesian is confined mostly to formal situations , existing in a diglossic relationship with vernacular Malay varieties , which are commonly used for daily communication .
