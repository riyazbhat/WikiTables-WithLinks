The metropolis stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland and its population is officially estimated at 1.8 million residents . With a greater metropolitan area of 3.1 million residents , Warsaw is the 5th most-populous urban area in the European Union . The city limits cover 517.24 square kilometres ( 199.71 sq mi ) , while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres ( 2,355.39 sq mi ) . Warsaw is an alpha global city , a major international tourist destination , and a significant cultural , political and economic hub . Its historical old town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Once described as the Paris of the North , Warsaw was believed to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world until World War II . Bombed at the start of the German invasion in 1939 , the city withstood a siege for which it was later awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for heroism , the Virtuti Militari . Deportations of the Jewish population to concentration camps led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the destruction of the Ghetto after a month of combat . A general Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944 led to even greater devastation and systematic razing by the Germans in advance of the Vistula-Oder Offensive . Warsaw gained the new title of Phoenix City because of its extensive history and complete reconstruction after World War II , which had left over 85% of its buildings in ruins . Warsaw is one of Europe 's most dynamic metropolitan cities .",

Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Krak\u00f3w ; the inhabitants had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania .

Lublin witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century . A Calvinist congregation was founded and groups of radical Arians appeared in the city , making it an important global centre of Arianism .
