The movement rejected both the commercial perfection of the Hollywood style , and the auteur-oriented European art cinema , for a cinema created as a tool for political and social change . Due not in a small part to the filmmakers lack of resources , aesthetic was of secondary importance to cinema 's social function . The movement 's main goal was to create films in which the viewer became an active , self-aware participant in the discourse of the film . Viewers were presented with an analysis of a current problem within society that as of that time had no clear solution , hoping to make the audience aware of the problem and to leave the theater willing to become actors of social change .",
