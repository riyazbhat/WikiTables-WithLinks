  "/wiki/Aero_A.300": "The Aero A.300 was a Czechoslovak bomber aircraft that first flew in 1938 as a much refined development of the A.304 ( despite what the numbering would suggest ) . Designed by Aero as a replacement for the obsolete , locally-built Bloch MB.200 bombers Czechoslovak Air Force , the Aero A-304 transport/bomber formed the basis for its design . The new aircraft mounted Bristol Mercury IX radial engines rated at 610 kW/820 hp and carried three machine guns for defense . The A-300 was faster than any other Czechoslovakian aircraft in the inventory except for the Avia B-35 fighter . Despite showing much promise , development and production of the aircraft was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II",

  "/wiki/Avro_Lincoln": "The Avro Type 694 , better known as the Avro Lincoln , is a British four-engined heavy bomber , which first flew on 9 June 1944 . Developed from the Avro Lancaster , the first Lincoln variants were initially known as the Lancaster IV and V ; these were renamed Lincoln I and II . It was the last piston-engined bomber operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . The Lincoln attained operational status in August 1945 . It had been initially assigned to units of the Tiger Force , a Commonwealth heavy bomber force which had been intended to play a role in the closing stages of the Second World War by participating in the Japan campaign with operations against the Japanese mainland ; the war ended before the Lincoln went into action . Production of the type proceeded and the type was adopted in quantity , allowing it to complement and progressively replace the preceding Lancaster in RAF service during the late 1940s . The Lincoln was deployed on operations during the 1950s . RAF squadrons equipped with the type were used as part of Britain 's action against guerrilla fighters during the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya ; the RAF and the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) operated the Lincoln during the Malayan Emergency . In addition to its wartime use , the type also saw significant service with the RAAF and the Argentine Air Force ( Spanish : Fuerza A\u00e9rea Argentina ) . Lincolns also saw some use in civil aviation , often being operated as aerial test beds for aero-engine research . In RAF service , the Lincoln was replaced by a new generation of bombers harnessing newly developed jet propulsion . Chief amongst these was the English Electric Canberra , which was also adopted by a wide range of operators across the world including the RAAF and Argentine Air Force",
  "/wiki/Beechcraft_XA-38_Grizzly": "The Beechcraft XA-38 Grizzly was a World War II-era ground attack aircraft , developed by Beechcraft , but never put into production . The Grizzly was to have been fitted with a forward-firing 75 mm cannon , to penetrate heavily armored targets . While the first prototype flew on 7 May 1944 , testing established that the type would not be ready for the projected invasion of Japan . It also featured the Wright R-3350 engines already in use with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress - which had priority . Consequently , the XA-38 was canceled after a second prototype had been completed",
  "/wiki/Blackburn_Firebrand": "The Blackburn Firebrand was a British single-engine strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft . Originally intended to serve as a pure fighter , its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability . Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until after the end of the war . Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953",
  "/wiki/Bloch_MB.162": "The Bloch MB.162 was a French four-engine , long-range bomber developed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch in the late 1930s . Only a single prototype was built ; after capture by German forces , it was pressed into service with the Luftwaffe as a transport",
  "/wiki/Boeing_XB-15": "The Boeing XB-15 ( Boeing 294 ) was a United States bomber aircraft designed in 1934 as a test for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) to see if it would be possible to build a heavy bomber with a 5,000 mi ( 8,000 km ) range . For a year beginning in mid-1935 it was designated the XBLR-1 . When it first flew in 1937 , it was the most massive and voluminous aircraft ever built in the US . It set a number of load-to-altitude records for land-based aircraft , including carrying a 31,205 lb ( 14,154 kg ) payload to 8,200 ft ( 2,500 m ) on 30 July 1939 . The aircraft 's immense size allowed flight engineers to enter the wing through a crawlway and make minor repairs in flight . A 5,000 mi ( 8,000 km ) flight took 33 hours at its 152 mph ( 245 km/h ) cruising speed ; the crew was made up of several shifts , and bunks allowed them to sleep when off duty",
  "/wiki/Boeing_XB-38_Flying_Fortress": "The XB-38 Flying Fortress was a single example conversion of a production B-17E Flying Fortress , testing whether the Allison V-1710 V type engine could be substituted for the standard Wright R-1820 radial engine during early World War II",
  "/wiki/Boeing_XB-39_Superfortress": "The Boeing XB-39 Superfortress was a United States prototype bomber aircraft , a single example of the B-29 Superfortress converted to fly with alternative powerplants . It was intended to demonstrate that the B-29 could still be put into service even if the first choice of engine , the air-cooled Wright R-3350 radial engine , ran into development or production difficulties",
  "/wiki/Boeing_XB-44_Superfortress": "The Boeing B-50 Superfortress is an American strategic bomber . A post-World War II revision of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress , it was fitted with more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-4360 radial engines , stronger structure , a taller tail fin , and other improvements . It was the last piston-engined bomber built by Boeing for the United States Air Force , and was further refined into Boeing 's final such design , the B-54 . Not as well known as its direct predecessor , the B-50 was in USAF service for nearly 20 years . After its primary service with Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) ended , B-50 airframes were modified into aerial tankers for Tactical Air Command ( TAC ) ( KB-50 ) and as weather reconnaissance aircraft ( WB-50 ) for the Air Weather Service . Both the tanker and hurricane hunter versions were retired in March 1965 due to metal fatigue and corrosion found in the wreckage of KB-50J , 48-065 , which crashed on 14 October 1964",
