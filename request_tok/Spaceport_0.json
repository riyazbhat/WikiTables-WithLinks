The Cosmodrome is the world 's first and largest operational space launch facility . The spaceport is located in the desert steppe of Baikonur , about 200 kilometres ( 124 mi ) east of the Aral Sea and north of the river Syr Darya . It is near the Tyuratam railway station and is about 90 metres ( 300 ft ) above sea level . Baikonur cosmodrome and the city of Baikonur celebrated the 63rd anniversary of the foundation on 2 June 2018 . The spaceport is currently leased by the Kazakh Government to Russia until 2050 , and is managed jointly by the Roscosmos State Corporation and the Russian Aerospace Forces . The shape of the area leased is an ellipse , measuring 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) east-west by 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) north-south , with the cosmodrome at the centre . It was originally built by the Soviet Union in the late 1950s as the base of operations for the Soviet space program . Under the current Russian space program , Baikonur remains a busy spaceport , with numerous commercial , military , and scientific missions being launched annually . All crewed Russian spaceflights are launched from Baikonur . Both Sputnik 1 , the first artificial satellite , and Vostok 1 , the first human spaceflight , were launched from Baikonur . The launch pad used for both missions was renamed Gagarin 's Start in honor of Russian Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin , pilot of Vostok 1 and first human in space .",
  "/wiki/R-7_(rocket_family)": "The R-7 family of rockets ( Russian : \u0420-7 ) is a series of rockets , derived from the Soviet R-7 Semyorka , the world 's first ICBM . More R-7 rockets have been launched than any other family of large rockets . When Soviet nuclear warheads became lighter , the R-7 turned out to be impractical as a ballistic missile . It was not necessary to launch such heavy payloads in a military application . The rockets became useful in the Soviet , and later , Russian space programmes with long-term development . Their purpose shifted primarily to launching satellites , probes , manned and unmanned spacecraft , and other non-threatening payloads . The R-7 family consists of both missiles and orbital carrier rockets . Derivatives include the Vostok , Voskhod and Soyuz rockets , which as of 2019 have been used for all Soviet , and later Russian human spaceflights . The type has a unique configuration where four break-away liquid-fueled engines surround a central core . The core acts as , in effect , a second stage after the other four engines are jettisoned . These rockets are expendable . Later modifications were standardised around the Soyuz design .",
  "/wiki/Soyuz_(rocket)": "The Soyuz ( Russian : \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 , meaning union , GRAU index 11A511 ) was a Soviet expendable carrier rocket designed in the 1960s by OKB-1 and manufactured by State Aviation Plant No . 1 in Kuybyshev , Soviet Union . It was commissioned to launch Soyuz spacecraft as part of the Soviet human spaceflight program , first with 8 uncrewed test flights , followed by the first 19 crewed launches . The original Soyuz also propelled four test flights of the improved Soyuz 7K-T capsule between 1972 and 1974 . In total it flew 30 successful missions over 10 years and suffered two failures . The Soyuz 11A511 type , a member of the R-7 family of rockets , first flew in 1966 . Derived from the Voskhod 11A57 type , It was a two-stage rocket , with four liquid-fuelled strap-on boosters clustered around the first stage , with a Block I second stage . The new , uprated core stage and strap-ons became standard for all R-7 derived launch vehicles to replace the numerous older variants in use on the 8A92 , 11A57 , and 8K78M types . While the original Blok I stage as developed in 1960 used RD-107 engines , the Soyuz boosters instead had RD-110s , which were more powerful due to the heavier weight of the Soyuz craft and also had several design improvements to increase reliability and safety on crewed missions . The Molniya 8K78M booster also adopted the RD-110 during 1965 , but Voskhod boosters continued using the older RD-107 . Starting in 1973 , the original Soyuz rocket was gradually superseded by the Soyuz-U derivative type , which became the world 's most prolific launcher , flying hundreds of missions over 43 years until its retirement scheduled for 2016 . Other direct variants were Soyuz-L for low Earth orbit tests of the LK lunar lander ( 3 flights ) and Soyuz-M built for a quickly abandoned military spacecraft and used for reconnaissance satellites instead ( 8 flights ) .",

The Kosmos family contained a number of rockets , both carrier rockets and sounding rockets , for orbital and sub-orbital spaceflight respectively . The first variant , the Kosmos-2I , first flew on 27 October 1961 . Over 700 Kosmos rockets have been launched overall .",
  "/wiki/Proton_(rocket)": "Proton ( Russian : \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d ) ( formal designation : UR-500 ) is an expendable launch system used for both commercial and Russian government space launches . The first Proton rocket was launched in 1965 . Modern versions of the launch system are still in use as of 2019 , making it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight . All Protons are built at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center factory in Moscow , transported to the Baikonur Cosmodrome , brought to the launch pad horizontally , and raised into vertical position for launch . As with many Soviet rockets , the names of recurring payloads became associated with the Proton . The moniker Proton originates from a series of similarly named scientific satellites , which were among the rocket 's first payloads . During the Cold War , it was designated the D-1/D-1e or SL-12/SL-13 by Western intelligence agencies . Launch capacity to low Earth orbit is about 22.8 tonnes ( 50,000 lb ) . Geostationary transfer capacity is about 6.3 tonnes ( 14,000 lb ) . Commercial launches are marketed by International Launch Services ( ILS ) . The rocket is intended to be retired before 2030 . As of June 2018 [ update ] , production on the Proton rocket is ceasing as the new Angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational .",

It is based on the R-36 intercontinental ballistic missile designed by Mikhail Yangel and made eight launches , with seven successes and one failure . All of its launches were conducted from LC-90 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome . It is sometimes designated Tsyklon-2A , not to be confused with the later Tsyklon-2 rocket . It was introduced in 1967 and was derived from the R-36 ICBM ( NATO designation SS-9 Scarp ) . It was retired in 1969 . It made its maiden flight on 27 October 1967 . The booster 's design was kept secret and no images or film clips of the complete vehicle were released to the public until after the collapse of the Soviet Union in part because of being used exclusively for military payloads and also because it was derived from an actively serving missile system . After 1991 , the plant where the R-36/Tsyklon were manufactured ended up in newly-independent Ukraine . Tsyklon was designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau and manufactured by Yuzhmash ( both in Dnipropetrovsk , Ukraine ) . Control system was designed at NPO Electropribor ( Kharkiv , Ukraine ) . The last flown derivative , the Tsyklon-3 was retired in January 2009 , however another derivative , the Tsyklon-4 , is still under development .",
  "/wiki/Zenit_(rocket_family)": "Zenit ( Ukrainian : \u0417\u0435\u043d\u0456\u0442 , Russian : \u0417\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0442 ; meaning Zenith ) is a family of space launch vehicles designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau in Dnipro , Ukraine , which was then part of the Soviet Union . Zenit was originally built in the 1980s for two purposes : as a liquid rocket booster for the Energia rocket and , equipped with a second stage , as a stand-alone middle-weight launcher with a payload greater than the 7 tonnes of the Soyuz but smaller than the 20 tonnes payload of the Proton . The last rocket family developed in the USSR , the Zenit was intended as an eventual replacement for the dated R-7 and Proton families , and it would employ propellants which were safer and less toxic than the Proton 's nitrogen tetroxide/UDMH mix . Zenit was planned to take over crewed spaceship launches from Soyuz , but these plans were abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . Zenit-3SL is launched by the Sea Launch consortium 's floating launch platform in the Pacific Ocean and Zenit-2 is launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . The engines of the Zenit 's first and second stages as well as the upper stage of the Zenit-3SL rocket are supplied by Russia . There are plans to use an improved Zenit-3SLB rocket for commercial launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome beginning in April 2008 . This service is marketed as Land Launch . Zenit-3SL has launched 36 times with 32 successes , one partial success , and three failures . The first failure , the launch of a Hughes-built communications satellite owned by ICO Global Communications , occurred during the second commercial launch on March 12 , 2000 and was blamed on a software error that failed to close a valve in the second stage of the rocket . The second failure occurred on January 30 , 2007 when the rocket exploded on the Odyssey launch platform , seconds after engine ignition . The NSS-8 communication satellite on board was destroyed .",

The Scout multistage rocket was the first ( and for a long time , the only ) orbital launch vehicle to be entirely composed of solid fuel stages . The original Scout ( an acronym for Solid Controlled Orbital Utility Test system ) was designed in 1957 at the NACA Langley center . Scout launch vehicles were used from 1961 until 1994 . To enhance reliability the development team opted to use off the shelf hardware , originally produced for military programs . According to the NASA fact sheet :",
  "/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)": "Atlas is a family of US missiles and space launch vehicles that originated with the SM-65 Atlas . The Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) program was initiated in the late 1950s under the Convair Division of General Dynamics . Atlas was a liquid propellant rocket burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen in three engines configured in an unusual stage-and-a-half or parallel staging design : two outboard booster engines were jettisoned along with supporting structures during ascent , while the center sustainer engine , propellant tanks and other structural elements remained connected through propellant depletion and engine shutdown . The Atlas name was originally proposed by Karel Bossart and his design team working at Convair on project MX-1593 . Using the name of a mighty titan from Greek mythology reflected the missile 's place as the biggest and most powerful at the time . It also reflected the parent company of Convair , the Atlas Corporation . The missiles saw only brief ICBM service , and the last squadron was taken off operational alert in 1965 . However , from 1962 to 1963 Atlas boosters launched the first four US astronauts to orbit the Earth ( in contrast to the preceding two Redstone suborbital launches ) . The Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur satellite launch vehicles were also derived directly from the original Atlas . The Atlas-Centaur was evolved into the Atlas II , various models of which were launched 63 times between 1991 and 2004 . There were only six launches of the succeeding Atlas III , all between 2000 and 2005 . The Atlas V is still in service , with launches planned into the 2020s .",

Titan vehicles were also used to lift US military payloads as well as civilian agency intelligence-gathering satellites and to send highly successful interplanetary scientific probes throughout the Solar System .",
  "/wiki/Saturn_(rocket_family)": "The Saturn family of American rockets was developed by a team of mostly German rocket scientists led by Wernher von Braun to launch heavy payloads to Earth orbit and beyond . The Saturn family used liquid hydrogen as fuel in the upper stages . Originally proposed as a military satellite launcher , they were adopted as the launch vehicles for the Apollo Moon program . Three versions were built and flown : the medium-lift Saturn I , the heavy-lift Saturn IB , and the super heavy-lift Saturn V. The Saturn name was proposed by von Braun in October 1958 as a logical successor to the Jupiter series as well as the Roman god 's powerful position . In 1963 , president John F. Kennedy identified the Saturn I SA-5 launch as being the point where US lift capability would surpass the Soviets , after having been behind since Sputnik . He last mentioned this in a speech given at Brooks AFB in San Antonio on the day before he was assassinated . To date , the Saturn V is the only launch vehicle to transport human beings beyond low Earth orbit . A total of 24 humans were flown to the Moon in the four years spanning December 1968 through December 1972 . No Saturn rocket failed catastrophically in flight .",

The cosmodrome was originally constructed as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles called Svobodny-18 . It was initially selected as a replacement for Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic , which became independent as Kazakhstan after the dissolution of the Soviet Union . However the development of Svobodny was subsequently ended in 2007 in favour of a totally new space port , the Vostochny Cosmodrome . The breakup of the Soviet Union left the primary cosmodrome , to be used by successor state Russia , at Baikonur in a foreign country , Kazakhstan . An arrangement to rent the facilities for $ 115 million annually was arranged . Launches were moved to other facilities , like Plesetsk Cosmodrome , but this location is too far north to be useful for many launches . Studies for a far-east location closer to the latitude of Baikonur started , [ when ? ] and initially settled on the existing missile base at Svobodny . This was located near the railway station of Ledyanaya , and had been used for several decades by the 27th rocket division of Strategic Rocket Forces . In the summer of 1994 president Yeltsin visited the town of Blagoveshensk and the modification of the launch pads in the site began shortly after . On March 1 , 1996 the Russian president issued a decree formally declaring the site as a cosmodrome .",
