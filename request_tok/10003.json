  "/wiki/Accident": "An accident is an unplanned event that sometimes has convenient or undesirable consequences , other times being inconsequential . The term implies that such an event may not be preventable since its antecedent circumstances go unrecognized and unaddressed . Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity .",

  "/wiki/Southern_Ocean": "The Southern Ocean , also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean , [ note 4 ] comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean , generally taken to be south of 60\u00b0 S latitude and encircling Antarctica . As such , it is regarded as the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions : smaller than the Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean . This oceanic zone is where cold , northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters . By way of his voyages in the 1770s , James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe . Since then , geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean 's northern boundary or even existence , considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian Oceans , instead . However , according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization ( IHO ) , recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation , and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation . This remains the current official policy of the IHO , since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted . Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary . The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean , using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel , was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019 . The expedition 's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60\u00b0 28 ' 46S , 025\u00b0 32 ' 32W , with a depth of 7,434 meters . The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo , has proposed naming this deepest point in the Southern Ocean the Factorian Deep , based on the name of the manned submersible DSV Limiting Factor , in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 3 , 2019 .",
  "/wiki/Aircraft": "An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air . It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil , or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines . Common examples of aircraft include airplanes , helicopters , airships ( including blimps ) , gliders , paramotors and hot air balloons . The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation . The science of aviation , including designing and building aircraft , is called aeronautics . Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot , but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers . Aircraft may be classified by different criteria , such as lift type , aircraft propulsion , usage and others .",
  "/wiki/Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901": "The Mount Erebus disaster occurred on 28 November 1979 when Air New Zealand Flight 901 ( TE-901 ) [ nb 1 ] flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island , Antarctica , killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew on board . Scheduled Air New Zealand Antarctic sightseeing flight had been operating between 1977 and 1979 . This flight was supposed to leave Auckland Airport in the morning and spend a few hours flying over the Antarctic continent , before returning to Auckland in the evening via Christchurch . The initial investigation concluded the accident was caused by pilot error , but public outcry led to the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the crash . The commission , presided over by Justice Peter Mahon QC , concluded that the accident was caused by a correction made to the coordinates of the flight path the night before the disaster , coupled with a failure to inform the flight crew of the change , with the result that the aircraft , instead of being directed by computer down McMurdo Sound ( as the crew had been led to believe ) , was instead re-routed to a path toward Mount Erebus . Justice Mahon 's report accused Air New Zealand of presenting an orchestrated litany of lies and this led to changes in senior management at the airline . The Privy Council later ruled that the finding of a conspiracy was a breach of natural justice and not supported by the evidence . The accident is New Zealand 's deadliest peacetime disaster , as well as the deadliest accident in the history of Air New Zealand .",

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo , which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time , ruling most of the Korean Peninsula , Manchuria , parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great . Its capital , Seoul , is a major global city and half of South Korea 's over 51 million people live in the Seoul Capital Area , the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world . The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period . Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC . Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century , Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty ( 918-1392 ) and the Joseon dynasty ( 1392-1897 ) . The succeeding Korean Empire was annexed into the Empire of Japan in 1910 . After World War II , Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones , with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948 . In 1950 , a North Korean invasion began the Korean War and after its end in 1953 , the country 's economy began to soar , recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990 . Authoritarian rule ended in 1987 and the country is now the most advanced democracy with the highest level of press freedom in Asia . South Korea is a member of the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee , the G20 and the Paris Club . South Korea is a highly developed country and the world 's 12th-largest economy by nominal GDP .",
  "/wiki/Fishing_trawler": "A fishing trawler is a commercial fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls . Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers . Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth . A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously ( double-rig and multi-rig ) . There are many variants of trawling gear . They vary according to local traditions , bottom conditions , and how large and powerful the trawling boats are . A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30 horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000 horsepower . Trawl variants include beam trawls , large-opening midwater trawls , and large bottom trawls , such as rock hoppers that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom .",
  "/wiki/Ross_Sea": "The Ross Sea is a deep bay of the Southern Ocean in Antarctica , between Victoria Land and Marie Byrd Land and within the Ross Embayment , and is the southernmost sea on Earth . It derives its name from the British explorer James Ross who visited this area in 1841 . To the west of the sea lies Ross Island and Victoria Land , to the east Roosevelt Island and Edward VII Peninsula in Marie Byrd Land , while the southernmost part is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf , and is about 200 miles ( 320 km ) from the South Pole . Its boundaries and area have been defined by the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research as having an area of 637,000 square kilometres ( 246,000 sq mi ) . The circulation of the Ross Sea is dominated by a wind-driven ocean gyre and the flow is strongly influenced by three submarine ridges that run from southwest to northeast [ citation needed ] . The circumpolar deep water current is a relatively warm , salty and nutrient-rich water mass that flows onto the continental shelf at certain locations . The Ross Sea is covered with ice for most of the year [ citation needed ] . The nutrient-laden water supports an abundance of plankton and this encourages a rich marine fauna . At least ten mammal species , six bird species and 95 fish species are found here , as well as many invertebrates , and the sea remains relatively unaffected by human activities . New Zealand has claimed that the sea comes under its jurisdiction as part of the Ross Dependency . Marine biologists consider the sea to have a high level of biological diversity and it is the site of much scientific research . It is also the focus of some environmentalist groups who have campaigned to have the area proclaimed as a world marine reserve .",
