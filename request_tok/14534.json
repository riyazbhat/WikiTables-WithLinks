Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine , but by the band 's second album , Out of Exile , it was noted that they had established a separate identity . Their unique sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock and 1990s alternative rock , with musical influences that included 1960s funk , soul and R & B .

In their six years together , Audioslave released three albums , received three Grammy nominations , sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba .

They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as the globe 's loudest band for a 1972 concert at London 's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide . Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus ( 1976-1984 ) . The 1968-1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I , II , III and IV . Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan ( vocals ) , Jon Lord ( keyboards ) , Roger Glover ( bass ) , Ian Paice ( drums ) , and Ritchie Blackmore ( guitar ) . This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993 . The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans ( lead vocals ) and Nick Simper ( bass , backing vocals ) , between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale ( lead vocals ) and Glenn Hughes ( bass , vocals ) ( and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975 ) , and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner ( vocals ) . The band 's line-up ( currently including Ian Gillan , and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994 ) has been much more stable in recent years , although keyboardist Jon Lord 's retirement from the band in 2002 ( being succeeded by Don Airey ) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band . Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1 's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme , and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the most influential bands ever ."
