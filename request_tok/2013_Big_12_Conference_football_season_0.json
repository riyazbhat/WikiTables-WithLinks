  "/wiki/Tight_End": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time",
