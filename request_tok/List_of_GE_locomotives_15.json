  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit",
  "/wiki/GE_U28CG": "The GE U28CG was a dual-service diesel-electric locomotive produced in 1966 by GE Transportation Systems and derived from their freight-hauling U28C design . The sole customer was the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway , which ordered ten early that year for delivery in July and August . By that date , no North American locomotive builder cataloged a dedicated passenger-locomotive design ; instead , all that was available were steam-generator equipped versions of freight roadswitcher designs . The railroad 's F units , the backbone of its passenger fleet , were old and increasingly troublesome , and the Santa Fe needed to get some replacements in short order . GE 's waiting list was shorter , and GE offered better trade-in deals for old Alcos the road wanted to get rid of . The ten units were delivered in Santa Fe 's trademark Warbonnet silver and red paint scheme , but not identical in all details to previous applications . The yellow and black separation lines between the red and silver were absent , and the bodyside 'Santa Fe ' lettering was large , billboard-style , in a Cooper Black typeface , instead of the smaller black serif all-caps version previously used . ( That style would later be resurrected in 1989 ) . Instead of silver trucks , frame and tanks , they were black from the factory - and were repainted silver later . The locomotives were numbered in the 3-digit passenger series , with road numbers 350-359 . Since the GE U-boat design had provision for a train-heating steam generator between the cab and the engine compartment , the U28CG 's dimensions were identical to the U28C . There was a bulge in the hood on the left-hand side to accommodate the steam generator , which was a Vapor-Clarkson unit , skid-mounted for easy repair and replacement",

  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor",
  "/wiki/GE_U30CG": "The GE U30CG was a passenger-hauling diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems . It was a passenger variant of GE 's U30C design purchased by the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway . ATSF had purchased ten U28CG locomotives in 1966 , but while these locomotives were satisfactory operationally , they looked like freight locomotives , not passenger locomotives . Desiring smooth-sided passenger power , the railroad ordered the first cowl units from both GE and GM-EMD . GE produced the U30CG to meet this requirement . It was identical to a U30C except that the bodywork was replaced with a full-width long hood with fluted stainless-steel panels , and a full-width rounded nose and slanted cab front were fitted . GE 's original design had the rounded nose flush with the pilot front , but the Santa Fe rejected this , and the locomotives were fitted with a front walkway . The locomotives were painted in the Santa Fe 's famous Warbonnet colors , in exactly the same style as the railroad 's F units - unlike the modified scheme used on the U28CGs . The six production locomotives were delivered to the ATSF ( road numbers 400-405 ) in November 1967 , a month before EMD 's competing FP45s . The locomotives ' initial primary assignment was to the Grand Canyon Limited between Chicago and Los Angeles , but they were also seen on the Super Chief as well as secondary trains such as the Texas Chief and the San Diegan . All this came to an end on February 9 , 1969 when a U30CG derailed hauling the Grand Canyon Limited on Edelstein Hill near Chillicothe , Illinois . The U30CG design was suspected , and both classes of GE passenger locomotives were placed on freight assignments , and never were reinstated to passenger service",
  "/wiki/GE_U34CH": "The U34CH was a 3,600 hp ( 2,700 kW ) passenger diesel locomotive built by General Electric between 1970 and 1973 . In total , 33 U34CH units were built ; 32 were built for the New Jersey Department of Transportation and operated by the Erie Lackawanna Railway and , later , Conrail , with the last unit coming as a later rebuild of a GE U30C for the New York MTA",
  "/wiki/GE_P30CH": "The GE P30CH ( nicknamed Pooch because of the similarity of the designation ) was one of the first brand-new diesel-electric locomotives built for Amtrak by General Electric during Amtrak 's early years . The design was based on the GE U30C , but had a cowl carbody like its EMD competitors . Amtrak operated them from 1974-1992 . A breakdown of the P30CH name reveals its full name :",

  "/wiki/GE_Genesis": "General Electric Genesis ( officially trademarked GENESIS ) is a series of passenger diesel locomotives produced by GE Transportation , then a subsidiary of General Electric . Between 1992 and 2001 , a total of 321 units were built for Amtrak , Metro-North , and Via Rail . The Genesis series of locomotives was designed by General Electric in response to a specification published by Amtrak and ultimately selected over a competing design presented by Electro-Motive Diesel ( EMD ) . The Genesis series are the lowest North American diesel-electric locomotives . This height restriction allows the locomotive to travel easily through low-profile tunnels in the Northeast Corridor . The Genesis series is lower than even the previous-generation F40PH by 14 inches ( 356 mm )",
