  "/wiki/Avro_Anson": "The Avro Anson is a British twin-engined , multi-role aircraft built by the aircraft manufacturer Avro . Large numbers of the type served in a variety of roles for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) , Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) and numerous other air forces before , during , and after the Second World War . Initially known as the Avro 652A , the Anson was developed during the mid-1930s from the earlier Avro 652 airliner in response to a request for tenders issued by the British Air Ministry for a maritime reconnaissance aircraft . Having suitably impressed the Ministry , a single prototype was ordered , which conducted its maiden flight on 24 March 1935 . Following an evaluation in which the Type 652A bettered the competing de Havilland DH.89 , it was selected as the winner , leading to Air Ministry Specification 18/35 being written around the type and an initial order for 174 aircraft being ordered in July 1935 . The Type 652A was promptly named after British Admiral George Anson . The type was placed into service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and was initially used in the envisioned maritime reconnaissance operation alongside the larger flying boats . After the outbreak of the Second World War the Anson was soon found to have become obsolete in front line combat roles . Large numbers of the type were instead put to use as a multi-engined aircrew trainer , having been found to be suitable for the role , and became the mainstay of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan . The type continued to be used in this role throughout and after the conflict , remaining in RAF service as a trainer and communications aircraft until 28 June 1968 . During the post-war climate , the Anson was increasingly produced for the civil market , being used as a light transport and executive aircraft . By the end of production in 1952 , a total of 8,138 Ansons had been constructed by Avro in nine variants ; in addition , a further 2,882 aircraft were manufactured by Federal Aircraft Ltd in Canada from 1941",
  "/wiki/Bristol_Beaufort": "The Bristol Beaufort ( manufacturer designation Type 152 ) was a British twin-engined torpedo bomber designed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company , and developed from experience gained designing and building the earlier Blenheim light bomber . At least 1,180 Beauforts were built by Bristol and other British manufacturers . The Australian government 's Department of Aircraft Production ( DAP ) also manufactured variants of the Beaufort . These are often known collectively as the DAP Beaufort . More than 700 Australian-built Beauforts saw service with the Royal Australian Air Force in the South West Pacific theatre , where they were used until the end of the war . Beauforts first saw service with Royal Air Force Coastal Command and then the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm from 1940 . They were used as torpedo bombers , conventional bombers and mine-layers until 1942 , when they were removed from active service and were then used as trainer aircraft until being declared obsolete in 1945 . Beauforts also saw considerable action in the Mediterranean ; Beaufort squadrons based in Egypt and on Malta helped interdict Axis shipping supplying Rommel 's Deutsches Afrikakorps in North Africa . Although it was designed as a torpedo-bomber , the Beaufort was more often used as a medium day bomber . The Beaufort also flew more hours in training than on operational missions and more were lost through accidents and mechanical failures than were lost to enemy fire . The Beaufort was adapted as a long-range heavy fighter variant called the Beaufighter , which proved to be very successful and many Beaufort units eventually converted to the Beaufighter",

Hooton Park was home to No . 610 ( County of Chester ) Squadron and , post World War II , to No . 611 ( West Lancashire ) and No . 663 ( AOP ) Squadron . The airfield closed in 1957 after the disbandment of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force , but the three pairs of Belfast Truss hangars erected in 1917 survived the closure . The site was bought by Vauxhall Motors , who built their Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant there , which today produces the Vauxhall Astra . A small remaining section of the airfield site is now owned and managed by The Hooton Park Trust . The hangars are also home to The Griffin Trust and an aircraft preservation society named The Aeroplane Collection .

  "/wiki/Bristol_Blenheim": "The Bristol Blenheim is a British light bomber aircraft designed and built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company ( Bristol ) which was used extensively in the first two years and in some cases throughout the Second World War . The aircraft was developed as Type 142 , a civil airliner , in response to a challenge from Lord Rothermere to produce the fastest commercial aircraft in Europe . The Type 142 first flew in April 1935 , and the Air Ministry , impressed by its performance , ordered a modified design as the Type 142M for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) as a bomber . Deliveries of the newly named Blenheim to RAF squadrons commenced on 10 March 1937 . A development of the Type 142M was the Type 149 which Bristol named the Bolingbroke , retrospectively changed by the Air Ministry to Blenheim Mk IV and the Type 142M to the Blenheim Mk I. Fairchild Canada built the Type 149 under licence as the Bolingbroke . Blenheims Mk I and the Mk IV were adapted as fighters by the addition of a gun pack of four Browning .303 machine guns in the bomb bay . The Mk IV was used as a long range fighter and as a maritime patrol aircraft ; both aircraft were used as bomber/gunnery trainers . The Blenheim was one of the first British aircraft with an all-metal stressed-skin construction , retractable landing gear , flaps , a powered gun turret and variable-pitch propellers . The Mk I was faster than most fighters in the late 1930s but the advance in development of monoplane fighters made all bombers more vulnerable particularly if flown in daylight , though it proved successful as a night fighter . The Blenheim was effective as a bomber but many were shot down . Both Blenheim types were used by overseas operators , being licence built in Yugoslavia and Finland",

In combat , the Defiant was found to be reasonably effective at destroying bombers but was vulnerable to the Luftwaffe 's more manoeuvrable , single-seat Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters . The lack of forward-firing armament proved to be a great weakness in daylight combat and its potential was realised only when it was converted to night fighting .

  "/wiki/Bristol_Beaufighter": "The Bristol Type 156 Beaufighter ( often called the Beau ) is a multi-role aircraft developed during the Second World War by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in the UK . It was originally conceived as a heavy fighter variant of the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber . The Beaufighter proved to be an effective night fighter , which came into service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the Battle of Britain , its large size allowing it to carry heavy armament and early airborne interception radar without major performance penalties . The Beaufighter was used in many roles ; receiving the nicknames Rockbeau for its use as a rocket-armed ground attack aircraft and Torbeau as a torpedo bomber against Axis shipping , in which it replaced the Beaufort . In later operations , it served mainly as a maritime strike/ground attack aircraft , RAF Coastal Command having operated the largest number of Beaufighters amongst all other commands at one point . The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) also made extensive use of the type as an anti-shipping aircraft , such as during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea . The Beaufighter saw extensive service during the war with the RAF ( 59 squadrons ) , Fleet Air Arm ( 15 squadrons ) , RAAF ( seven squadrons ) , Royal Canadian Air Force ( four squadrons ) , United States Army Air Forces ( four squadrons ) , Royal New Zealand Air Force ( two squadrons ) , South African Air Force ( two squadrons ) and Polskie Si\u0142y Powietrzne ( Free Polish Air Force ; one squadron ) .

Led by Vickers-Armstrongs ' chief designer Rex Pierson ; a key feature of the aircraft is its geodetic airframe fuselage structure , which was principally designed by Barnes Wallis . Development had been started in response to Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 , which was issued in the middle of 1932 . This specification called for a twin-engined day bomber capable of delivering higher performance than any previous design . Other aircraft developed to the same specification include the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the Handley Page Hampden . During the development process , performance requirements such as for the tare weight changed substantially , and the engine used was not the one originally intended . The Wellington was used as a night bomber in the early years of the Second World War , performing as one of the principal bombers used by Bomber Command . During 1943 , it started to be superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined heavies such as the Avro Lancaster . The Wellington continued to serve throughout the war in other duties , particularly as an anti-submarine aircraft . It holds the distinction of having been the only British bomber that was produced for the duration of the war , and of having been produced in a greater quantity than any other British-built bomber .

  "/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane": "The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s-40s that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. for service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the Supermarine Spitfire 's role during Battle of Britain in 1940 , but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the Luftwaffe in the engagement , and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War . The Hurricane originated from discussions between RAF officials and aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm about a proposed monoplane derivative of the Hawker Fury biplane in the early 1930s . Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the Air Ministry , Hawker refined their monoplane proposal , incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft , including retractable landing gear and the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . The Air Ministry ordered Hawker 's Interceptor Monoplane in late 1934 , and the prototype Hurricane K5083 performed its maiden flight on 6 November 1935 . In June 1936 , the Hurricane went into production for the Air Ministry ; it entered squadron service on 25 December 1937 . Its manufacture and maintenance was eased by using conventional construction methods so that squadrons could perform many major repairs without external support . The Hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , when the RAF had 18 Hurricane-equipped squadrons in service . The aircraft was relied on to defend against German aircraft operated by the Luftwaffe , including dogfighting with Messerschmitt Bf 109s in multiple theatres of action . The Hurricane was developed through several versions , into bomber-interceptors , fighter-bombers , and ground support aircraft as well as fighters .
