Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 . Following their victory in the 2018 World Series , they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21st century , with championships in 2004 , 2007 , 2013 and 2018 . The team 's history has also been marked by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees , arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports",
