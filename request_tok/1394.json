  "/wiki/Y_Gododdin": "Y Gododdin ( Welsh : [ \u0259 \u0261\u0254\u02c8d\u0254\u00f0\u026an ] ) is a medieval Welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to the men of the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and its allies who , according to the conventional interpretation , died fighting the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at a place named Catraeth in about AD 600 . It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin and survives only in one manuscript , the Book of Aneirin . The Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century , but Y Gododdin has been dated to between the 7th and the early 11th centuries . The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh . The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle , presumably in the Hen Ogledd ( Old North ) ; as such it would have been written in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic . Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th , 10th , or 11th century . Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry . The Gododdin , known in Roman times as the Votadini , held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and Northumberland , part of the Hen Ogledd . The poem tells how a force of 300 ( or 363 ) picked warriors were assembled , some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd . After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn , now Edinburgh , they attacked Catraeth , which is usually identified with Catterick , North Yorkshire . After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds , nearly all the warriors are killed . The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry , with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory , but is not a narrative .",
