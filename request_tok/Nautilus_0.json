  "/wiki/Queensland": "Queensland ( locally /\u02c8kwi\u02d0nzl\u00e6nd/ KWEENZ-land , [ note 1 ] abbreviated as Qld ) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia . Situated in the north-east of the country , it is bordered by the Northern Territory , South Australia and New South Wales to the west , south-west and south respectively . To the east , Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean . To its north is the Torres Strait , with Papua New Guinea located less than 200 km across it from the mainland . The state is the world 's sixth-largest sub-national entity , with an area of 1,852,642 square kilometres ( 715,309 sq mi ) . As of 15 May 2018 , Queensland had a population of 5,000,000 , concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state 's South East . The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane , Australia 's third-largest city . Often referred to as the Sunshine State , Queensland is home to 10 of Australia 's 30 largest cities and is the nation 's third-largest economy . Tourism in the state , fuelled largely by its warm climate , is a major industry . Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders . The first European to land in Queensland ( and Australia ) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606 , who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa . In 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus": "Carl Linnaeus ( /l\u026a\u02c8ni\u02d0\u0259s , l\u026a\u02c8ne\u026a\u0259s/ ; 23 May [ note 1 ] 1707 - 10 January 1778 ) , also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linn\u00e9 ( Swedish pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0251\u02d0\u026d f\u0254n l\u026a\u02c8ne\u02d0 ] ( listen ) ) , was a Swedish botanist , zoologist , and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature , the modern system of naming organisms . He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",
  "/wiki/Foraminifera": "Foraminifera ( /f\u0259\u02ccr\u00e6m\u0259\u02c8n\u026af\u0259r\u0259/ ; Latin for hole bearers ; informally called forams ) are members of a phylum or class of amoeboid protists characterized by streaming granular ectoplasm for catching food and other uses ; and commonly an external shell ( called a test ) of diverse forms and materials . Tests of chitin ( found in some simple genera , and Textularia in particular ) are believed to be the most primitive type . Most foraminifera are marine , the majority of which live on or within the seafloor sediment ( i.e. , are benthic ) , while a smaller variety float in the water column at various depths ( i.e. , are planktonic ) . Fewer are known from freshwater or brackish conditions , and some very few ( nonaquatic ) soil species have been identified through molecular analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA . Foraminifera typically produce a test , or shell , which can have either one or multiple chambers , some becoming quite elaborate in structure . These shells are commonly made of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) or agglutinated sediment particles . Over 50,000 species are recognized , both living ( 10,000 ) and fossil ( 40,000 ) . They are usually less than 1 mm in size , but some are much larger , the largest species reaching up to 20 cm . In modern Scientific English , the term foraminifera is both singular and plural ( irrespective of the word 's Latin derivation ) , and is used to describe one or more specimens or taxa : its usage as singular or plural must be determined from context . Foraminifera is frequently used informally to describe the group , and in these cases is generally lowercase .",
  "/wiki/Adriatic_Sea": "The Adriatic Sea /\u02cce\u026adri\u02c8\u00e6t\u026ak/ is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula . The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea , extending from the Strait of Otranto ( where it connects to the Ionian Sea ) to the northwest and the Po Valley . The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Italy , Montenegro and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands , mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1,233 metres ( 4,045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) in summer to 12 \u00b0C ( 54 \u00b0F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate . The Adriatic Sea sits on the Apulian or Adriatic Microplate , which separated from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era . The plate 's movement contributed to the formation of the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate .",

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea . In addition , the Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea .",

  "/wiki/Helix_(genus)": "Helix is a genus of large , air-breathing land snails native to Europe and the Mediterranean region . They are the type genus of the family Helicidae and among the first animal genera described by Carl Linnaeus . Members of the genus first appeared during the Oligocene . Like most land snails , Helix species are hermaphroditic , and like other helicids a courting pair will impale each other with hormone-rich love darts prior to exchanging sperm . Well-known species include Helix pomatia ( Roman snail , Burgundy snail , or edible snail ) and Helix lucorum ( Turkish snail ) . Cornu aspersum ( garden snail ) - another well-known helicid - was originally described as a member of Helix ( as Helix aspersa ) , but the prevailing classification places it in the sister genus Cornu . Helix snails have been harvested for human consumption since prehistoric times . In the common era , members of the genus ( particularly H. pomatia ) are farmed throughout the world for the dish escargot , an hors d'oeuvre . The establishment of snail farms outside of Europe has introduced several species to North America , South America , and Africa , where some escapees have established themselves as invasive species .",
