Founded in 1947 as Asocia\u021bia Sportiv\u0103 a Armatei Bucure\u0219ti , it has spent its entire history in the Liga I , the top tier of the Romanian football league system . The team was initially part of the CSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti sports club and belonged to the Romanian Army . In 1998 , the club and facilities were separated from the armed forces and sold to a group of shareholders in a post-Ceau\u0219escu privatization scheme , subsequently leading to one of the shareholders acquiring full ownership five years later . However , the same Army sued the football club in 2011 ; the club has since been in a legal conflict regarding the ownership of the Steaua brand and honours , which resulted in multiple court cases and the change of the name to FCSB in early 2017 . Domestically , the club have won Liga I 26 times , Cupa Rom\u00e2niei 22 times , Cupa Ligii 2 times and Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei 6 times - all competition records . Internationally , they have won the European Cup and European Super Cup , both in 1986 . They reached the European Cup final once again in 1989 , when they were defeated by A.C. Milan . Throughout its history , Steaua also played the final of the Intercontinental Cup , the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners ' Cup and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup . Their home ground is Arena Na\u021bional\u0103 , having moved here from the Ministry of National Defence-owned Stadionul Ghencea . Initially , the club played in the colours of the Romanian tricolour - blue , yellow and red - but yellow soon lost its importance and the team became associated with the red and blue colours . Recently , some kits have begun reintegrating the yellow colour",
