Despite interest in a sequel , Touchstone Pictures opted not to finance one . Shyamalan set out to write Split using a character he had written for Unbreakable but pulled from its script due to balance issues . Shyamalan realized the opportunity he had to create a trilogy of works , and used the ending of Split to establish the film as within the Unbreakable narrative . This included securing the rights to use Willis 's Unbreakable character from Walt Disney Studios , with the promise of including Disney within the production and distribution of this third film alongside Universal Pictures . Split was a financial and critical success , and by April 2017 , Shyamalan announced that he started the production process for Glass . The film had its world premiere at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema on January 12 , 2019 and was released in the United States on January 18 , 2019 , by Universal Pictures . Glass received generally unfavorable reviews from critics , who found the film disappointing and underwhelming .
