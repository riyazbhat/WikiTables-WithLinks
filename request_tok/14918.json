  "/wiki/Association_football_positions": "In the sport of association football , each of the 11 players on a team is assigned to a particular position on the field of play . A team is made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive , midfield , and attacking positions depending on the formation deployed . These positions describe both the player 's main role and their area of operation on the pitch . In the early development of the game , formations were much more offensively aggressive , with the 1-2-7 being prominent in the late 1800s . In the latter part of the 19th century , the 2-3-5 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this . In defence , there were full-backs , known as the left-back and right-back ; in midfield , left-half , centre-half and right-half ; and for the forward line there were outside-left ( or left wing ) , inside-left , centre-forward , inside-right and outside-right ( or right wing ) . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game ( though some old familiar ones remain ) . The term half-back fell out of use by the early 1970s and midfield was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield . The fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as rigidly defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills and physical attributes . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions are referred to as utility players . However , in Total Football tactics , the players are only loosely defined into a position .",
  "/wiki/Forward_(association_football)": "Forwards are the players on a football ( soccer ) team who play nearest to the opposing team 's goal , and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals . Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players . Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards ; for example , the common 4-2-3-1 formation includes one forward . Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards , or none .",

  "/wiki/Youth_system": "In sporting terminology , a youth system is a youth investment program within a particular team or league , which develops and nurtures young talent in farm teams , with the vision of using them in the first team in the future if they show enough promise and potential , and to fill up squad numbers in some teams with small budgets . In contrast to most sports in the United States where the high school and collegiate system is responsible for developing young sports people , most football and basketball clubs , especially in Europe and Latin America , take responsibility for developing their own players of the future .",
  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",
