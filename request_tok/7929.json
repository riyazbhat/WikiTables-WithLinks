With rapid expansion , however , it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads , spurring its rapid growth . The city 's name derives from that of the Western and Atlantic Railroad 's local depot , signifying the town 's growing reputation as a transportation hub . During the American Civil War , the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in General William T. Sherman 's famous March to the Sea . However , the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the New South . During the 1950s and 1960s , Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement , with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , Ralph David Abernathy , and many other locals playing major roles in the movement 's leadership . During the modern era , Atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub , with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport being the world 's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998 .",

  "/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional , even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality . Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Court 's unanimous ( 9-0 ) decision stated that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal , and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . However , the decision 's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools , and the Court 's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 ( 1955 ) ) only ordered states to desegregate with all deliberate speed . The case originated in 1951 , when the public school district in Topeka , Kansas , refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home , instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school farther away . The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations then filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education , alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional . A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict against the Browns , relying on the precedent of the Supreme Court 's 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , in which the Court had ruled that racial segregation was not in itself a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause if the facilities in question were otherwise equal , a doctrine that had come to be known as separate but equal . The Browns , then represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall , appealed to the Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case . The Court 's decision in Brown partially overruled Plessy v. Ferguson by declaring that the separate but equal notion was unconstitutional for American public schools and educational facilities . [ note 1 ] It paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases . In the American South , especially the Deep South , where racial segregation was deeply entrenched , the reaction to Brown among most white people was noisy and stubborn . Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as Massive Resistance , created by Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd , in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems . Four years later , in the case of Cooper v. Aaron , the Court reaffirmed its ruling in Brown , and explicitly stated that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify its ruling .",

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education , 402 U.S. 1 ( 1971 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools . The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools , even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race . This was done to ensure the schools would be properly integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race . Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Brown v. Board of Education case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate . In 1963 , the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration , and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation [ citation needed ] . In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation ; thus , it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools . In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education ( 1969 ) , Judge Frank Johnson 's desegregation order for teachers was upheld , allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge .",

Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain , it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture . The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public park ( Boston Common , 1634 ) , first public or state school ( Boston Latin School , 1635 ) and first subway system ( Tremont Street Subway , 1897 ) .

  "/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws": "Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States . All were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures after the Reconstruction period . The laws were enforced until 1965 . In practice , Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America and other states , starting in the 1870s and 1880s . Jim Crow laws were upheld in 1896 in the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson , in which the U.S. Supreme Court laid out its separate but equal legal doctrine for facilities for African Americans . Moreover , public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War ( 1861-65 ) . The legal principle of separate but equal racial segregation was extended to public facilities and transportation , including the coaches of interstate trains and buses . Facilities for African Americans and Native Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to the facilities for white Americans ; sometimes , there were no facilities for people of color . As a body of law , Jim Crow institutionalized economic , educational , and social disadvantages for African Americans and other people of color living in the South . Jim Crow laws and Jim Crow state constitutional provisions mandated the segregation of public schools , public places , and public transportation , and the segregation of restrooms , restaurants , and drinking fountains for whites and blacks . The U.S. military was already segregated . President Woodrow Wilson , a Southern Democrat , initiated the segregation of federal workplaces in 1913 .",

  "/wiki/Racial_segregation": "Racial segregation is the systemic separation of people into racial or other ethnic groups in daily life . Segregation can involve spatial separation of the races , and mandatory use of different institutions , such as schools and hospitals by people of different races . Specifically , it may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant , drinking from a water fountain , using a public toilet , attending school , going to the movies , riding on a bus , or in the rental or purchase of a home or of hotel rooms . In addition , segregation often allowed close contact in hierarchical situations , such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race . Segregation is defined by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance as the act by which a ( natural or legal ) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification , in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination . As a result , the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation . According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues , The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation , if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature . Racial segregation has been generally outlawed worldwide . In the United States , segregation was mandated by law in some states ( such as the Jim Crow laws ) and came with anti-miscegenation laws ( prohibitions against interracial marriage ) , until the U.S. Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren started a liberal Constitutional Revolution in 1950s and 1960s which outlawed racial segregation throughout the United States . However , racial segregation may exist de facto through social norms , even when there is no strong individual preference for it , as suggested by Thomas Schelling 's models of segregation and subsequent work . Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to vigilante violence ( such as lynchings ) . Generally , a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as separation or de facto separation of the races rather than segregation .",
