  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",
  "/wiki/Nave": "The nave /ne\u026av/ is the central part of a church , stretching from the ( normally western ) main entrance or rear wall , to the transepts , or in a church without transepts , to the chancel . When a church contains side aisles , as in a basilica-type building , the strict definition of the term nave is restricted to the central aisle . In a broader , more colloquial sense , the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers , including the side-aisles and transepts . Either way , the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy .",
  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",
  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight . Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages . In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived .",
  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Calvinism": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millennium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox .

  "/wiki/Vernacular_architecture": "Vernacular architecture is architecture characterised by the use of local materials and knowledge , usually without the supervision of professional architects . Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings , building traditions , and methods of construction . Vernacular buildings are typically simple and practical , whether residential houses or built for other purposes . Although it encompasses 95 % of the world 's built environment , vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design . It is not one specific style , so it can not be distilled into a series of easy-to-digest patterns , materials , or elements . Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders , vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture . Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or polite architecture which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building 's functional requirements . This article also covers the term traditional architecture , which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes .",

  "/wiki/Normans": "The Normans ( Norman : Normaunds ; French : Normands ; Latin : Nortmanni/Normanni ; Old Norse : Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r ) are an ethnic group that arose from contact between Norse Viking settlers of a region in France , named Normandy after them , and indigenous Franks and Gallo-Romans . The settlements in France followed a series of raids on the French coast from mainly Norway , but also Denmark , and Iceland , and they gained political legitimacy when the Viking leader Rollo agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia . The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries . The Norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and the Near East . The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Catholic piety , becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy of the Romance community into which they assimilated . They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as Norman , Normaund or Norman French , an important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of Normandy and the nearby Channel Islands . The Duchy of Normandy , which they formed by treaty with the French crown , was a great fief of medieval France , and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . The Normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations . Norman adventurers played a role in founding the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after briefly conquering southern Italy and Malta from the Saracens and Byzantines , during an expedition on behalf of their duke , William the Conqueror , which also led to the Norman conquest of England at the historic Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Norman and Anglo-Norman forces contributed to the Iberian Reconquista from the early eleventh to the mid-thirteenth centuries . Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East , where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant , to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain , to Ireland , and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands . The legacy of the Normans persists today through the regional languages and dialects of France , England , Spain , and Sicily , as well as the various cultural , judicial , and political arrangements they introduced in their conquered territories .",
  "/wiki/Anglo-Saxons": "The Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century . They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe , their descendants , and indigenous British groups who adopted many aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language ; the cultural foundations laid by the Anglo-Saxons are the foundation of the modern English legal system and of many aspects of English society ; the modern English language owes over half its words - including the most common words of everyday speech - to the language of the Anglo-Saxons . Historically , the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066 , after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest . The early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation , with many of the aspects that survive today , including regional government of shires and hundreds . During this period , Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language . Charters and law were also established . The term Anglo-Saxon is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century . In scholarly use , it is more commonly called Old English . The history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity . It developed from divergent groups in association with the people 's adoption of Christianity , and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms . Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England , this identity was re-established ; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest . The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings , dress styles , illuminated texts and grave goods .",
  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Ashlar": "Ashlar ( /\u02c8\u00e6\u0283l\u0259r/ ) is finely dressed ( cut , worked ) stone , either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it . Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit , generally rectangular cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones , ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks , and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments : tooled , smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect . One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb . Generally used only on softer stone ashlar , this decoration is known as mason 's drag . Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry , which employs irregularly shaped stones , sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size , or both . Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral , such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry . Ashlar may be coursed , which involves lengthy horizontals layers of stone blocks laid in parallel , and therefore with continuous horizontal joints . Ashlar may also be random , which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally . In either case , it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together , although dry ashlar construction , metal ties , and other methods of assembly have been used . The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous .",

  "/wiki/Flint": "Flint is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz , categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone . Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires . It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks , such as chalks and limestones . Inside the nodule , flint is usually dark grey , black , green , white or brown in colour , and often has a glassy or waxy appearance . A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches . Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces , making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools . The use of flint to make stone tools dates back millions of years , and flint 's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time . Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age . During the Stone Age , access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint . Flint Ridge in Ohio was an important source of flint and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge . This Ohio Flint was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico .",

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building . Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world , many styles of historic framing have developed . These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation , walls , how and where the beams intersect , the use of curved timbers , and the roof framing details .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",
  "/wiki/Barrel_vault": "A barrel vault , also known as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault , is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve ( or pair of curves , in the case of a pointed barrel vault ) along a given distance . The curves are typically circular in shape , lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design . The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault : effectively a series of arches placed side by side ( i.e. , one after another ) . It is a form of barrel roof . As with all arch-based constructions , there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault . There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust . One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method . A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other ; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other . This method was most often used in construction of churches , where several vaulted naves ran parallel down the length of the building . However , the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing . The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles , thus forming a groin vault . Barrel vaults are known from Ancient Egypt , and were used extensively in Roman architecture .",

In 1951 he co-founded the fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and was its leader until 2008 . Paisley became known for his fiery sermons and regularly preached and protested against Roman Catholicism , ecumenism and homosexuality . He gained a large group of followers who were referred to as Paisleyites . Paisley became involved in Ulster unionist/loyalist politics in the late 1950s . In the mid-late 1960s , he led and instigated loyalist opposition to the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland . This contributed to the outbreak of the Troubles in the late 1960s , a conflict that would engulf Northern Ireland for the next thirty years . In 1970 he became Member of Parliament for North Antrim and the following year he founded the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) , which he would lead for almost forty years . In 1979 he became a Member of the European Parliament . Throughout the Troubles , Paisley was seen as a firebrand and the face of hardline unionism .

Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments , but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist .

The five solae summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Roman Catholic Church . Protestantism began in Germany [ c ] in 1517 when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church , which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers . However , the term derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical . Although there were earlier breaks and attempts to reform the Roman Catholic Church - notably by Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , and Jan Hus - only Luther succeeded in sparking a wider , lasting , and modern movement . In the 16th century , Lutheranism spread from Germany [ d ] into Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Latvia , Estonia , and Iceland . Reformed ( or Calvinist ) denominations spread in Germany , [ e ] Hungary , the Netherlands , Scotland , Switzerland and France by reformers such as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . The political separation of the Church of England from the pope under King Henry VIII began Anglicanism , bringing England and Wales into this broad Reformation movement . [ f ] Protestants have developed their own culture , with major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and many other fields .",

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",

Around 89 % of Quakers worldwide belong to the evangelical and programmed branches of Quakerism - these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible , coordinated by a pastor . Around 11 % of Friends practice waiting worship , or unprogrammed worship ( more commonly known today as Meeting for Worship ) , where the order of service is not planned in advance , is predominantly silent , and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present .

  "/wiki/Ditchling_Unitarian_Chapel": "Ditchling Unitarian Chapel ( formerly Ditchling General Baptist Chapel , and also known as The Old Meeting House ) is a Unitarian chapel in Ditchling , a village in the English county of East Sussex . A congregation of General Baptists began to meet in the 17th century in the village , which was a local centre for Protestant Nonconformist worship , and by the time the present simple Vernacular-style chapel was constructed in 1740 a large proportion of the population held Baptist beliefs . Along with other General Baptist chapels in Sussex , the congregation moved towards Unitarian views in the mid-18th century ; this caused a schism which resulted in a new chapel being formed at nearby Wivelsfield . The character of the Ditchling chapel was wholly Unitarian by 1800 , and it has continued under various names since then . People associated with the chapel include William Hale White ( the author Mark Rutherford ) , Henry Acton , Adrian Boult - who was married there - and G. K. Chesterton . The chapel is set back from Ditchling 's main street and has an adjoining house ( built in 1672 ) and graveyard , all of which contribute to the character of the conservation area which covers the centre of Ditchling village . English Heritage has listed the chapel at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance .",
  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan .",

A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading .

  "/wiki/Palladian_architecture": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today .",

  "/wiki/River_Ouse,_Sussex": "The Ouse ( /u\u02d0z/ OOZ ) is a river in the English counties of West and East Sussex . It rises near Lower Beeding in West Sussex , and flows eastwards and then southwards to reach the sea at Newhaven . It skirts Haywards Heath and passes through Lewes . It forms the main spine of an extensive network of smaller streams , of which the River Uck is the main tributary . As it nears the coast it passes through the Lewes and Laughton Levels , an area of flat , low-lying land that borders the river and another tributary , the Glynde Reach . It was a large tidal inlet at the time of the Domesday book in 1086 , but over the following centuries , some attempts were made to reclaim some of the valley floor for agriculture , by building embankments , but the drainage was hampered by the buildup of a large shingle bar which formed across the mouth of the river by longshore drift . In 1539 , a new channel for the entrance to the river was cut through the shingle bar , and meadows flourished for a time , but flooding returned and meadows reverted to marshland . The engineer John Smeaton proposed a solution for the drainage of the valley in 1767 , but it was only partly implemented . William Jessop surveyed the river in 1788 , and produced proposals to canalise the upper river above Lewes , and to radically improve the lower river . The Proprietors of the River Ouse Navigation were created by Act of Parliament in 1790 , and eventually built 19 locks , to enable boats to reach Upper Ryelands Bridge at Balcombe . Trustees and the Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels jointly managed the work on the lower river , and the agriculturalist John Ellman continued the progress while he was Expenditor for the Commissioners , which enabled 120-ton ships to reach Lewes by 1829 . Navigation on the upper river could not compete with the railways , and all traffic had ceased by 1868 .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80 % of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",
