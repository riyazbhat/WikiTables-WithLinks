  "/wiki/B_Division_(New_York_City_Subway)": "The New York City Subway 's B Division consists of the lines that operate with lettered services ( A , B , C , D , E , F , G , J , L , M , N , Q , R , W , and Z ) , as well as the Franklin Avenue and Rockaway Park Shuttles . These lines and services were operated by the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) and city-owned Independent Subway System ( IND ) before the 1940 city takeover of the BMT . B Division rolling stock is wider , longer , and heavier than those of the A Division , measuring 10 or 9.75 ft ( 3,048 or 2,972 mm ) by 60 or 75 ft ( 18.29 or 22.86 m ) . The B Division is broken down into two subdivisions , B1 ( BMT ) and B2 ( IND ) , for chaining purposes . The two former systems are still sometimes referred to as the BMT Division and IND Division",
  "/wiki/Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan_Transit_Corporation": "The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) was an urban transit holding company , based in Brooklyn , New York City , United States , and incorporated in 1923 . The system was sold to the city in 1940 . Today , together with the IND subway system , it forms the B Division of the modern New York City Subway . The original BMT routes currently form the J/Z , L , M , N , Q , R and W trains , as well as the Franklin Avenue Shuttle , with the IND B , D , and F using BMT trackage in Brooklyn . The M train enters the IND via the Chrystie Street Connection after crossing the Williamsburg Bridge , the Q , along with some rush-hour N trains enter the IND from the BMT 63rd Street Line and the R train enters the IND via the 60th Street Tunnel Connection . The Z train supplements the J in the peak direction during rush hours only",
  "/wiki/BMT_Fourth_Avenue_Line": "The BMT Fourth Avenue Line is a rapid transit line of the New York City Subway , mainly running under Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn . The line is served by the D , N , and R at all times , and a few rush-hour W trains . The R and W run local while the D and N run express at all times except late nights , when they run local . The line was originally built by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ( BRT ; later Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation , or BMT ) and is now internally operated as part of the New York City Subway 's B Division . The fully underground line starts as a two-track line in Downtown Brooklyn west of Court Street , connecting to the BMT Broadway Line and BMT Nassau Street Line in Manhattan via the Montague Street Tunnel under the East River . It travels east under Montague and Willoughby Streets to DeKalb Avenue , where it then turns southeast under Flatbush Avenue . At DeKalb Avenue , the express tracks , which continue from the Manhattan Bridge to the northwest , split off from the BMT Brighton Line and join the Fourth Avenue Line . At Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center , the line curves southwest under Fourth Avenue to the end of the line at Bay Ridge-95th Street . Going south from Atlantic Avenue , the BMT West End Line splits from both the local and express tracks south of 36th Street , while the express tracks continue as the BMT Sea Beach Line south of 59th Street . Fourth Avenue never had a streetcar line or elevated railway due to the provisions of the assessment charged to neighboring property owners when the street was widened . Construction of the line was only undertaken because of the efforts of the local communities . After the line was opened , development resulting from the line 's construction transformed communities such as Dyker Heights , Fort Hamilton , Bay Ridge , and Sunset Park",
  "/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_Subway_stations_in_Manhattan": "The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system that serves four of the five boroughs of New York City in the U.S. state of New York : the Bronx , Brooklyn , Manhattan , and Queens . Operated by the New York City Transit Authority under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York , the New York City Subway is the busiest rapid transit system in the United States and the seventh busiest in the world , with 5.225 million daily riders . The system 's 472 stations qualifies it to have the largest number of rapid transit stations in the world . Three rapid transit companies merged in 1940 to create the present New York City Subway system : the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) , the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) , and the Independent Subway System ( IND ) . All three former systems are present in Manhattan",
  "/wiki/Independent_Subway_System": "The Independent Subway System ( IND or ISS ) , formerly known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System ( ICOS ) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad , was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway . It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932 . One of three rail networks that became part of the modern New York City subway , the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government , in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) companies . It was merged with these two networks in 1940 . The original IND service lines are the modern subway 's A , B , C , D , E , F , G and M services . In addition , the BMT 's N , Q and R now run partly on IND trackage . The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service . For operational purposes , the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division",
  "/wiki/IND_Sixth_Avenue_Line": "The IND Sixth Avenue Line is a rapid transit line of the B Division of the New York City Subway in the United States . It runs mainly under Sixth Avenue in Manhattan , and continues south to Brooklyn . The B , D , F , and M trains , which use the Sixth Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan , are colored orange . The B and D trains use the express tracks , while the F , < F > and M trains use the local tracks . The Sixth Avenue Line , constructed in stages during the 1930s , was the last trunk line built by the Independent Subway System ( IND ) before it was incorporated into the modern-day New York City Subway . It was more difficult to build than other subway trunk lines in New York City because construction had to proceed around , over , and under existing tunnels and elevated structures . The Sixth Avenue Line replaced the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) 's Sixth Avenue elevated , which closed in 1939 . The first section of the line opened in 1936 from West Fourth Street to East Broadway with service provided by Eighth Avenue Line trains . This section was initially referred to as the Houston-Essex Street Route . The Sixth Avenue subway was completed in 1940 , providing service north of West Fourth Street , connecting to the Queens Boulevard Line and the Eighth Avenue Line . Initially , the Sixth Avenue Line carried only local service , since there were no express tracks between 34th Street and West 4th Street . In 1967 and 1968 , the Chrystie Street Connection was completed , connecting the line with former BMT lines in Brooklyn via the Manhattan Bridge and with the BMT Jamaica Line over the Williamsburg Bridge",

Internally , the line is chained as Line A , with tracks A1 , A3 , A4 , and A2 from west to east , running from approximately 800 at the south end to 1540 at the north end ( measured in feet ) . The whole line is served at all times by the A train , which runs express except during late nights . The C provides local service south of 168th Street while the A runs express . In addition , the B provides weekday local service and the D full-time express service between the Concourse Line ( 145th Street ) and Sixth Avenue Line ( 59th Street-Columbus Circle ) junctions , and the E runs local from the Queens Boulevard Line junction at 50th Street south to World Trade Center . The A , C , and E are colored blue on signs because they run via Eighth Avenue through Midtown Manhattan , while the B and D are orange since they use the Sixth Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan",
  "/wiki/BMT_Brighton_Line": "The BMT Brighton Line , also known as the Brighton Beach Line , is a rapid transit line in the B Division of the New York City Subway in Brooklyn , New York City , United States . Local service is provided at all times by the Q train , but is joined by the B express train on weekdays . The Q train runs the length of the entire line from Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue to the Manhattan Bridge south tracks . The B begins at Brighton Beach and runs via the bridge 's north tracks . The line first opened in 1878 as a two-track surface-level excursion railroad called the Brooklyn , Flatbush and Coney Island Railway , transporting riders from Downtown Brooklyn via a connection with the Long Island Rail Road ( LIRR ) to the seaside resorts at Coney Island . When its connection with the LIRR was severed in 1883 , the line became the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad , which was eventually acquired by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ( BRT , later Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation [ BMT ] ) . From 1903 to 1908 , and again from 1918 to 1920 , all of the line 's grade crossings were eliminated ; as part of the second project , much of the original line was widened to four tracks and a new subway alignment was built north of the Prospect Park station . The northern part of the original line became the modern-day BMT Franklin Avenue Line , which still runs today . In subsequent years , numerous improvements were made to the Brighton Line",

  "/wiki/IRT_Broadway\u2013Seventh_Avenue_Line": "The IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line ( also known as the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or the IRT West Side Line ) is a New York City Subway line . It is one of several lines that serves the A Division , stretching from South Ferry in Lower Manhattan north to Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street in Riverdale , Bronx . The Brooklyn Branch , known as the Wall and William Streets Branch during construction , from the main line at Chambers Street southeast through the Clark Street Tunnel to Borough Hall in Downtown Brooklyn , is also part of the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line . The line was constructed in two main portions by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) , a private operator . The first portion , north of 42nd Street , was opened between 1904 and 1908 , and is part of the first subway line in the city . The line ran from City Hall , up the Lexington Avenue Line , across 42nd Street , and up Seventh Avenue and Broadway , before splitting into the Broadway Branch and the Lenox Avenue Line . The second portion of the line , that south of 42nd Street , was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts , which were signed between the IRT , the New York Municipal Railway ( a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ) , and the City of New York . Among the various subway lines that were to be constructed as part of the contracts , the West Side Line was to be extended south along Seventh Avenue to serve Manhattan 's West Side . This extension extended service to the end of Lower Manhattan and into Brooklyn , relieving crowding on the East Side Line , while opening up service to new areas . The Pennsylvania Railroad 's new hub in Manhattan , Penn Station , could now be accessed by the subway . Additionally , Manhattan 's West Side was rebuilt with the arrival of the line . To allow the wide four-track line to go through the area , new streets had to be mapped and built , and new buildings were constructed as a result",
  "/wiki/BMT_Canarsie_Line": "The BMT Canarsie Line ( sometimes referred to as the 14th Street-Eastern Line ) is a rapid transit line of the B Division of the New York City Subway system , named after its terminus in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn . It is served by the L train at all times , which is shown in medium gray on the New York City Subway map and on station signs . The line is part of the BMT Eastern Division , and is occasionally referred to as the Eastern District Line . This refers to Williamsburg , which was described as Brooklyn 's Eastern District when the City of Williamsburg was annexed by the former City of Brooklyn . This was the location where the original Brooklyn subway portions of the line were laid out . Only later was the line connected to the tracks leading to Canarsie . Eastern District High School , near the line 's Grand Street station , had preserved this toponym until it was closed in 1996 , later reopened as Grand Street Educational Campus . The Canarsie Line was first a steam railroad , then a Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ( BRT ) , later Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) , elevated line . It was extended into Manhattan via subway in 1924-1928 . Since the early 2000s , the line 's signal system has been converted to an automated system .
