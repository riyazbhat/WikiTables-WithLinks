The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers . The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the neoclassical style . Hoban modelled the building on Leinster House in Dublin , a building which today houses the Oireachtas , the Irish legislature . Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white . When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801 , he ( with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage . In 1814 , during the War of 1812 , the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington , destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior . Reconstruction began almost immediately , and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817 . Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829 . Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself , President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901 . Eight years later in 1909 , President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office , which was eventually moved as the section was expanded .",

  "/wiki/Laser": "A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation . The term laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation . The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories , based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow . A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent . Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot , enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography . Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ( collimation ) , enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar . Lasers can also have high temporal coherence , which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum , i.e. , they can emit a single color of light . Alternatively , temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond ( ultrashort pulses ) . Lasers are used in optical disk drives , laser printers , barcode scanners , DNA sequencing instruments , fiber-optic , semiconducting chip manufacturing ( photolithography ) , and free-space optical communication , laser surgery and skin treatments , cutting and welding materials , military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed , and in laser lighting displays for entertainment . They have been used for car headlamps on luxury cars , by using a blue laser and a phosphor to produce highly directional white light .",

  "/wiki/Post-modern": "Postmodernism is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late 20th century across philosophy , the arts , architecture , and criticism , marking a departure from modernism . The term has been more generally applied to describe what postmodernists believe to be the historical era following modernity and the tendencies of this era . While encompassing a wide variety of approaches and disciplines , postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of skepticism , irony , or rejection of the grand narratives and ideologies of modernism , often calling into question various assumptions of Enlightenment rationality . Consequently , common targets of postmodern critique include universalist notions of objective reality , morality , truth , human nature , reason , science , language , and social progress . Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the contingent or socially-conditioned nature of knowledge claims and value systems , situating them as products of particular political , historical , or cultural discourses and hierarchies . Accordingly , postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to self-referentiality , epistemological and moral relativism , pluralism , and irreverence . Postmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s , and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines , including cultural studies , philosophy of science , economics , linguistics , architecture , feminist theory , and literary criticism , as well as art movements in fields such as literature , contemporary art , and music . Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction , post-structuralism , and institutional critique , as well as philosophers such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard , Jacques Derrida , and Fredric Jameson . Criticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse , and include assertions that postmodernism promotes obscurantism , is meaningless , and that it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge .",
