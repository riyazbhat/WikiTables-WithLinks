Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales . He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there . There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years , although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988 , and by 1070 , it had already grown into a thriving city . Canute IV of Denmark , generally considered to be the last Viking king , was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense 's St Alban 's Priory on 10 July 1086 . Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry , it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages . After a period of decline , large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century , which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense , facilitating trade . In 1865 , one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built , further increasing the population and commerce , and by 1900 , Odense had reached a population of 35,000 .

Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",
