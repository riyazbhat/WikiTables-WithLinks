  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",

  "/wiki/Animation": "Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images . In traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . Today , most animations are made with computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings . Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets or clay figures . Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other . The illusion - as in motion pictures in general - is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement , but the exact causes are still uncertain . Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the ph\u00e9nakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope and film . Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . For display on the computer , techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . Animation is more pervasive than many people realize . Apart from short films , feature films , animated GIF 's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces and visual effects .",

  "/wiki/Making-of": "In cinema , a making-of , also known as behind-the-scenes , the set or on the set is a documentary film that features the production of a film or television program . This is often referred to as the EPK ( electronic press kit ) video , due to its main usage as a promotional tool , either concurrent with theatrical release or as a bonus feature for the film 's DVD or Blu-ray release . Feature length documentaries on the making of other films has become a film genre in its own right . The making-of film may ultimately be more important than the film itself . In the case of Lost in La Mancha , the making-of video ended up documenting the collapse and abandonment of the feature film it was covering ( The Man Who Killed Don Quixote ) , and ultimately the making-of video was the only part of the production to see a commercial release as a theatrical documentary feature . Shorter making-of documentaries are often used as a bonus on DVDs , as it offers more insight into the film , how it was made , and to credit the film crew . Occasionally , some films have included a making of the making-of as a joke . The making-of is also often released for TV as a part of the promotion of the film .",

In common usage , the term refers to text adventures , a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be text-only , however , graphical text adventure games , where the text is accompanied by graphics ( still images , animations or video ) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text . Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction , known as Puzzle-free , that focuses on narrative , and text adventures that focus on puzzles . Due to their text-only nature , they sidestepped the problem of writing for widely divergent graphics architectures . This feature meant that interactive fiction games were easily ported across all the popular platforms at the time , including CP/M ( not known for gaming or strong graphics capabilities ) . The number of interactive fiction works is increasing steadily as new ones are produced by an online community , using freely available development systems . The term can also be used to refer to digital versions of literary works that are not read in a linear fashion , known as gamebooks , where the reader is instead given choices at different points in the text ; these decisions determine the flow and outcome of the story . The most famous example of this form of printed fiction is the Choose Your Own Adventure book series , and the collaborative addventure format has also been described as a form of interactive fiction . The term interactive fiction is sometimes used also to refer to visual novels , a type of interactive narrative software popular in Japan .",

  "/wiki/Sitcom": "A sitcom , clipping for situational comedy ( situation comedy in the U.S. ) , is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy , where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch , and stand-up comedy , where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience . Sitcoms originated in radio , but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms . A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience , depending on the programme 's production format . The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track . During filming productions , the laugh track is usually pre-recorded . Critics disagree over the utility of the term sitcom in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century . Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track , thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom . Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons , such as The Simpsons or Family Guy , can be classified as sitcoms .",

The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 , and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily . The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century , developing a large domestic and international audience .

It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by David Slade . Netflix released the standalone film on 28 December 2018 . In Bandersnatch , viewers make decisions for the main character , the young programmer Stefan Butler ( Fionn Whitehead ) , who is adapting a fantasy choose-your-own-adventure novel into a video game in 1984 . Other characters include Mohan Thakur ( Asim Chaudhry ) and Colin Ritman ( Will Poulter ) , both of whom work at a video game company , Butler 's father , Peter ( Craig Parkinson ) , and Butler 's therapist , Dr. Haynes ( Alice Lowe ) .

It also alludes to Lewis Carroll 's own works that feature the bandersnatch creature . A piece of science fiction and horror , Bandersnatch incorporates meta-commentary and rumination on free will . Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones were approached by Netflix about making an interactive film in May 2017 , during which time Netflix had several interactive projects for children underway . Difficulty in writing the highly non-linear script led to the creation of a bespoke program called Branch Manager for Netflix ; the unique nature of the content required adaptations in the platform 's use of cache memory .

  "/wiki/Drama_(modern_genre)": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted .
