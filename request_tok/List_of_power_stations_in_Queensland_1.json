  "/wiki/Electric_power": "Electric Power is the rate , per unit time , at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit . The SI unit of power is the watt , one joule per second . Electric power is usually produced by electric generators , but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries . It is usually supplied to businesses and homes ( as domestic mains electricity ) by the electric power industry through an electric power grid . Electric energy is usually sold by the kilowatt hour ( 1 kW\u00b7h = 3.6 MJ ) which is the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours . Electric utilities measure energy using an electricity meter , which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer . Electric power can be delivered over long distances by transmission lines and used for applications such as motion , light or heat with high efficiency .",

  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .",

  "/wiki/Coal_seam_gas": "Coalbed methane ( CBM or coal-bed methane ) , coalbed gas , coal seam gas ( CSG ) , or coal-mine methane ( CMM ) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds . In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States , Canada , Australia , and other countries . The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal . It is called 'sweet gas ' because of its lack of hydrogen sulfide . The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining , where it presents a serious safety risk . Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir , as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called adsorption . The methane is in a near-liquid state , lining the inside of pores within the coal ( called the matrix ) . The open fractures in the coal ( called the cleats ) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water . [ citation needed ] Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs , coalbed methane contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane , and no natural-gas condensate . It often contains up to a few percent carbon dioxide .",

  "/wiki/Fuel_oil": "Fuel oil ( also known as heavy oil , marine fuel or furnace oil ) is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation , either as a distillate or a residue . In general terms , fuel oil is any liquid fuel that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power , except oils having a flash point of approximately 42 \u00b0C ( 108 \u00b0F ) and oils burned in cotton or wool-wick burners . Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains , particularly alkanes , cycloalkanes , and aromatics . The term fuel oil is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil , i.e. , heavier than gasoline and naphtha . Small molecules like those in propane , naphtha , gasoline for cars , and jet fuel have relatively low boiling points , and they are removed at the start of the fractional distillation process . Heavier petroleum products like diesel fuel and lubricating oil are much less volatile and distill out more slowly , while bunker oil is literally the bottom of the barrel ; in oil distilling , the only things denser than bunker fuel are carbon black feedstock and bituminous residue ( asphalt ) , which is used for paving roads and sealing roofs .",

  "/wiki/Kerosene": "Kerosene , also known as paraffin , lamp oil , and coal oil ( an obsolete term ) , is a combustible hydrocarbon liquid which is derived from petroleum . It is widely used as a fuel in aviation as well as households . Its name derives from Greek : \u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 ( keros ) meaning wax , and was registered as a trademark by Canadian geologist and inventor Abraham Gesner in 1854 before evolving into a genericized trademark . It is sometimes spelled kerosine in scientific and industrial usage . The term kerosene is common in much of Argentina , Australia , Canada , India , New Zealand , and the United States , while the term paraffin ( or a closely related variant ) is used in Chile , eastern Africa , South Africa , Norway , and in the United Kingdom . The term lamp oil , or the equivalent in the local languages , is common in the majority of Asia and Earth Oil in some parts of southern Asia . Liquid paraffin ( called mineral oil in the US ) is a more viscous and highly refined product which is used as a laxative . Paraffin wax is a waxy solid extracted from petroleum . Kerosene is widely used to power jet engines of aircraft ( jet fuel ) and some rocket engines and is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel , and for fire toys such as poi . In parts of Asia , kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small outboard motors or even motorcycles . World total kerosene consumption for all purposes is equivalent to about 1.2 million barrels ( 50 million U.S. gallons ; 42 million imperial gallons ; 190 million liters ) per day . To prevent confusion between kerosene and the much more flammable and volatile gasoline , some jurisdictions regulate markings or colorings for containers used to store or dispense kerosene .",
