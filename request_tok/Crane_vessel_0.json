The smaller cranes start around 50 ton [ which ? ] in lifting capacity , with the largest being able to lift 10,000 tons . The bigger sheerlegs usually have their own propulsion system and have a large accommodation facility on board , while smaller units are floating pontoons that need to be towed to their workplace by tugboats . Sheerlegs are commonly used for salvaging ships , assistance in shipbuilding , loading and unloading large cargo into ships , and bridge building . They have grown considerably larger over the last decades due to a marked increase in vessel , cargo , and component size ( of ships , offshore oil rigs , and other large fabrications ) , resulting in heavier lifts both during construction and in salvage operations .",

  "/wiki/VB-10,000_(ship)": "The VB-10,000 is a heavy-lift twin-gantry catamaran consisting of two truss space frames atop two barges . The design was derived from Versabar 's earlier VB-4000 ( aka Bottom Feeder ) , which was developed to clear debris from toppled oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . Instead of sending divers to section the wreckage into pieces , the heavy-lift capability facilitates salvaging the platform as a single piece . The primary benefit is increasing safety by reducing the number of high-risk diving activities , but substantial cost savings can be realized by reducing the number of lifts and shortening the decommissioning schedule . VB-10,000 is the largest lift vessel ever built in the United States . The color and shape of the trusses on VB-10,000 have prompted comparisons to the famed McDonald 's signature Golden Arches .",
