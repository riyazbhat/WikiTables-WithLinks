  "/wiki/Namor": "Namor the Sub-Mariner ( /\u02c8ne\u026am\u0254\u02d0r/ ) ( Namor McKenzie ) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . Debuting in early 1939 , the character was created by writer-artist Bill Everett for comic book packager Funnies Inc.. Initially created for the unreleased comic Motion Picture Funnies Weekly , the character first appeared publicly in Marvel Comics # 1 ( cover-dated Oct. 1939 ) , which was the first comic book from Timely Comics , the 1930s-1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics . During that period , known to historians and fans as the Golden Age of Comic Books , the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely 's top three characters , along with Captain America and the original Human Torch . The mutant son of a human sea captain and a princess of the mythical undersea kingdom of Atlantis , Namor possesses the super-strength and aquatic abilities of the Homo mermanus race , as well as the mutant ability of flight , along with other superhuman powers . Through the years , he has been portrayed as an antihero alternately from a good-natured but short-fused superhero or a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers committed against his kingdom . The first known comic book antihero , the Sub-Mariner has remained a historically important and relatively popular Marvel character . He has served directly with the Avengers , the Fantastic Four , the Invaders , the Defenders , the X-Men and the Illuminati as well as serving as a foil to them on occasion .",
