  "/wiki/Back_(rugby_union)": "In the game of rugby union , there are 15 players on each team , comprising eight forwards ( wearing jerseys numbered 1-8 ) and seven backs ( numbered 9-15 ) . In addition , there may be up to eight replacement players on the bench , numbered 16-23 . Players are not restricted to a single position , although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types . Players that play multiple positions are called utility players . Forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line-outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs . Props push in the scrums , while the hooker tries to secure the ball for his team by hooking it back with his heel . The hooker is also the one who is responsible for throwing the ball in at line-outs , where it is mostly competed for by the locks , who are generally the tallest players on the team . The flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team . The backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster . Successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking . Full-backs need to be good defenders and kickers , and have the ability to catch a kicked ball . The wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team and score many of the tries .",

  "/wiki/Captain_(sports)": "In team sport , captain is a title given to a member of the team . The title is frequently honorary , but in some cases the captain may have significant responsibility for strategy and teamwork while the game is in progress on the field . In either case , it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one 's teammates - recognition as a leader by one 's peers . In association football and cricket , a captain is also known as a skipper . Various sports have differing roles and responsibilities for team captains . Depending on the sport , team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules . In many team sports , the captains represent their respective teams when the match official does the coin toss at the beginning of the game . The team captain , in some sports , is selected by the team coach , who may consider factors ranging from playing ability to leadership to serving as a good moral example to the team . Coaches may also choose to change team captains from time to time , or to have a rotation of team captains . Some of the greatest captains in history are the ones with the most subtle of traits that are required for success . From Sam Walker in his book The Captain Class he states that a captain is the most important factor for a team 's success .",
