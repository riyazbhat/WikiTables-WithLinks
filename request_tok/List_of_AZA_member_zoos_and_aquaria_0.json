It was the first Spanish settlement on the mainland of the Americas to receive a coat-of-arms . During the colonial period , this city had the largest mercantile class and was at times wealthier than the capital of Mexico City . Its wealth attracted the raids of 17th-century pirates , against which fortifications such as Fort San Juan de Ul\u00faa were built . In the 19th and early 20th centuries , Veracruz was invaded on different occasions by France and the United States ; during the 1914 Tampico Affair , US troops occupied the city for seven months .

The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80 % of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50 % . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population",
