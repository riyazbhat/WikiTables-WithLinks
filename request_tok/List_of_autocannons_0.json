  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",

Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",

  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law .

  "/wiki/MG_FF_cannon": "The MG FF was a drum-fed , blowback-operated , 20 mm aircraft autocannon , developed in 1936 by Ikaria Werke Berlin of Germany . It was a derivative of the Swiss Oerlikon FF F cannon ( its FF suffix indicating Fl\u00fcgel Fest , for a fixed-mount , wing location from the Swiss original ) , with the Oerlikon FF design itself a development of the Imperial German World War I Becker 20 mm cannon , and was designed to be used in space-limited , fixed mountings such as inside aircraft wings , although it saw use as both an offensive and a defensive weapon , in both fixed and flexible format . It saw widespread use in those roles by the German Luftwaffe , particularly during the early stages of World War II , although from 1941 onwards it was gradually replaced by the Mauser firm 's 20 mm MG 151/20 . MG FF stands for Maschinengewehr Fl\u00fcgel Fest , which translates into machine gun , wing , fixed ; this reflects the fact that in Luftwaffe practice guns of 20 mm or less were designated as machine guns ( maschinengewehr ) as opposed to larger machine cannons , or autocannons , which were MK , for maschinenkanone The wing , fixed part reflects the fact that the primary motivation behind its design was to create a 20 mm caliber weapon that was compact and light enough to be mounted in the wings of aircraft , especially fighters . Compared to rival designs , such as the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 - which had been developed from the larger Oerlikon FF S - the MG FF had some disadvantages , such as low rate of fire and low muzzle velocity , as well as limited ammunition storage in its drums . On the other hand , it was much lighter and shorter . Even with its compact size , wing installation on the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters was not easy , as the drum required substantial space , and as a consequence the ammunition storage was initially reduced to 60 shells per drum . An ammunition drum of 90-round nominal capacity was developed for the Fw 190 A-5 , and retrofitted to some earlier variants . There were also experiments with belt feedings . The MG FF was adapted to fire a new type of high-capacity , high-explosive mine shell , called Minengeschoss that featured a projectile with thinner walls that allowed increased explosive charge . This projectile was lighter and thus had a higher muzzle velocity than the previous ammunition ; this also entailed that it generated less recoil than earlier projectiles requiring a modification of the recoil mechanism . With this modification it could fire the new mine shell , but accidentally using the heavier MG FF ammo could damage the gun .",

  "/wiki/Oerlikon_FF": "The FF were a series of 20mm autocannon introduced by Oerlikon in the late 1920s . The name comes from the German term Fl\u00fcgel Fest , meaning wing mounted , fixed , being one of the first 20mm guns to be small and light enough to fit into a fighter aircraft 's wing . The FF series inspired many 20mm cannon used in World War II , including the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 ( adopted by the French , British and U.S. forces ) , the German MG FF , and the Japanese IJNAS 's Type 99 cannon . The basic design was based on the original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon , in turn based on the German Empire 's Becker 20 mm cannon of World War I . In the post-war period , Oerlikon had developed the original design to produce three autocannons with increasingly powerful rounds ; the original model , later known as the F , used the Becker 20x70mm round , the newer L model used a 20x100 round , and finally the S model used a 20x110 . All of these weapons used the API blowback operational principle . In 1935 Oerlikon started development of versions suitable for use as wing-mounted guns . In addition to various changes needed for remote firing and cartidge ejection , the new series focused primarily on rate-of-fire . The original FF used a slightly upgraded 128 gram 20x72mm round with a muzzle velocity of 600 metres per second ( 2,000 ft/s ) at a cyclic rate of 520 rounds per minute , almost double that of the original F and AF models . The gun weighed only 24 kilograms ( 53 lb ) . Similar improvements led to the 30 kilograms ( 66 lb ) FF L using a longer 20x101mm round which gave 750 metres per second ( 2,500 ft/s ) , and the 39 kilograms ( 86 lb ) FF S firing a 20x110mm round at 830 metres per second ( 2,700 ft/s ) at a slightly slower 470 rounds per minute .

[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

  "/wiki/1.1\"/75_caliber_gun": "The 1.1/75 caliber gun was an American anti-aircraft weapon of World War II , used by the United States Navy . The name means that it had a bore diameter of 1.1 in ( 28 mm ) and barrel caliber of 75 ( 1.1 inches \u00d7 75 = 82.5 in ( 2.1 m ) ) . The gun was designed to replace the M2 Browning and four barrels were required to duplicate the rate of fire . The first shipboard installation in 1939 , was quickly nicknamed the Chicago Piano , possibly because it was the size of a baby grand piano and looked a little like a baby grand without its lid . ( Although the reminiscences of the sailors who served with these guns all agree on the nickname , no one seems to know where it originated . ) By 1941 , these guns had been mounted on destroyers , cruisers , battleships , aircraft carriers , and some auxiliary ships . Nearly a thousand guns had been produced before production shifted to more reliable shipboard anti-aircraft machine guns in 1942 . Quantities were minimal ; one mount for a destroyer , two mounts for pre-1930s battleships , and four mounts for North Carolina-class and newer battleships . On at least some ships they were director-controlled . The gun was very unpopular with its crews ; it was said that due to its tendency to jam , the only way to fire one was to position a gunner 's mate on his back underneath the mount , equipped with an assortment of wrenches and hammers to clear them . It was replaced by the 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) Oerlikon cannon or the 40 mm ( 1.6 in ) Bofors gun whenever possible , but served until the end of the war on some ships . A twin Bofors gun was about the same weight , and was a much more powerful gun ."
