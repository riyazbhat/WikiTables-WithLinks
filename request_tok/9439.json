Lying at the southeast end of the Dzungarian Gate , Ebi Lake is the center of the catchment of the southwestern part of the Dzungarian Basin . The lake previously covered over 1000 km2 ( 400 miles2 ) with an average depth of less than 2 meters ( 6.5 feet ) . In August 2007 , the Chinese government designated the adjoining Aibi Lake wetland as a National Nature Reserve . The high salt concentration ( 87 g/L ) of its water prevents plants and fish from living in the actual lake , though many kinds of fish do live in the mouths of its source rivers . The lake currently covers only 500 km2 surface",

Being the largest province-level division of China and the 8th largest country subdivision in the world , Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million km2 ( 640,000 square miles ) . The Aksai Chin region , administered by China mostly as part of Xinjiang 's Hotan Prefecture , is claimed by India . Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia ( Bayan-\u00d6lgii , Khovd and Govi-Altai Provinces ) , Russia ( Altai Republic ) , Kazakhstan ( East Kazakhstan and Almaty Provinces ) , Kyrgyzstan ( Issyk Kul , Naryn and Osh Regions ) , Tajikistan ( Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region ) , Afghanistan ( Badakhshan Province ) , Pakistan ( Gilgit Baltistan ) and India ( Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir ) . The rugged Karakoram , Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang 's borders , as well as its western and southern regions . Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai . The most well-known route of the historical Silk Road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border . In recent decades , abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China 's largest natural-gas-producing region . It is home to a number of ethnic groups , including the Uyghur , Han , Kazakhs , Tibetans , Hui , Tajiks , Kyrgyz , Mongols , Russians and Xibe . More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang . Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan . Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range .",

It is located in the northwestern part of the Dzungarian Basin , on the edge of the Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert . Administratively , the lake is situated within the Urho District of Karamay City , some 20 km south-east of the district 's main urban area . The Ailik Lake is fed by the Baiyang River , flowing from the Saur Mountains on the Dzungarian Basin 's northern rim ; the river forms a small delta as it enters the lake ( 45\u00b058\u203200\u2033N 85\u00b047\u203200\u2033E / 45.96667\u00b0N 85.78333\u00b0E / 45.96667 ; 85.78333 ) . As of 1999 , the lake 's water surface elevation was 273 metres ( 896 ft ) to 276 metres ( 906 ft ) above the sea level . Due to the construction of the Baiyang River Reservoir and the Huangyangquan Reservoir , and the concomitant diversion of the Baiyang River waters for irrigation , aquaculture , and other economic needs , the Ailik Lake started shrinking in the 1980s ; by the mid 1980s , it was just 15 km2 in size and hardly 1 meter deep ; by the 1990s , it had virtually dried up .

According to a report published in 2003 , since the opening of the canal on August 1 , 2000 , the Ailik lake , which had been almost dry , has been able to recover as a deep lake with plenty of fish ; now it occupies 50 km2 and is up to 7 m deep .

Until the early 1970s , two cyprinid species , Schizothorax biddulphi and Aspiorhynchus laticeps , the latter of which is endemic to Bosten Lake and the Yarkand River , were responsible for 80 percent of the annual catch .

Tibet is the highest region on Earth , with an average elevation of 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain , rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level . The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",

Shanghai is a global center for finance , innovation , and transportation , and the Port of Shanghai is the world 's busiest container port . Originally a fishing village and market town , Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location .

The city then flourished , becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s . During the Second Sino-Japanese War , the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai . After the war , with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949 , trade was limited to other socialist countries , and the city 's global influence declined .
