The recorded history of the town starts from the early 19th century when the colonial administration under the British Raj set up a sanatorium and a military depot in the region . Subsequently , extensive tea plantations were established in the region and tea growers developed hybrids of black tea and created new fermentation techniques . The resultant distinctive Darjeeling tea is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world . The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway connects the town with the plains and has some of the few steam locomotives still in service in India . Darjeeling has several British-style private schools , which attract pupils from all over India and a few neighbouring countries .
