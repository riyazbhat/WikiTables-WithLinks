The album includes the song A Hard Day 's Night , with its distinctive opening chord , and Ca n't Buy Me Love , both transatlantic number-one singles for the band . Several of the songs feature George Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar , a sound that was influential on the Byrds and on other groups in the folk rock movement . The title of the album was the accidental creation of drummer Ringo Starr . According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine : I was going home in the car and [ film director ] Dick Lester suggested the title , 'Hard Day 's Night ' from something Ringo had said . I had used it in In His Own Write , but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo . You know , one of those malapropisms . A Ringo-ism , where he said it not to be funny ... just said it . So Dick Lester said , 'We are going to use that title . '",

  "/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles . It was released on 5 August 1966 , accompanied by the double A-side single Eleanor Rigby / Yellow Submarine . The album was the Beatles ' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group 's most overt use of studio technology to date , building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul . It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in popular music , with recognition centred on its range of musical styles , diverse sounds , and lyrical content . The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966 , and during a period when London was feted as the era 's cultural capital . The songs reflect the group 's interest in the drug LSD , Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns . With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert , the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking , varispeed , reversed tapes , close audio miking , and instruments outside of their standard live set-up . Among its innovative tracks are the psychedelic Tomorrow Never Knows , recorded using tape loops controlled on several machines simultaneously ; Eleanor Rigby , a meditation on loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing ; and Love You To , a foray into Hindustani classical music . The sessions also produced a non-album single , Paperback Writer backed with Rain . In the United Kingdom , the album 's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release . In North America , Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records , with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today . The release there coincided with the Beatles ' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon 's remark that the band had become more popular than Jesus .",

  "/wiki/Back_in_the_U.S.S.R.": "Back in the U.S.S.R. is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that opens their 1968 double album The Beatles ( also known as the White Album ) . It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon-McCartney partnership . The song is a rock and roll parody of Chuck Berry 's Back in the U.S.A. and the Beach Boys ' California Girls . Its lyrics transpose Berry 's patriotic sentiments about the United States to Communist Russia , as the narrator expresses his relief at returning home to the Soviet Union , or more formally the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) . The Beatles recorded Back in the U.S.S.R. as a three-piece after Ringo Starr temporarily left the group , out of protest at McCartney 's criticism of his drumming and the tensions that typified the sessions for the White Album . Instead , the other Beatles created a composite drum track from numerous takes . McCartney 's singing was based on Jerry Lee Lewis , while the bridge features a Beach Boys-style celebration of girls from various locations in the USSR . The track opens and closes with a tape loop of an aircraft landing on a runway . The song 's release took place six months after the Warsaw Pact 's invasion of Czechoslovakia , and its sympathetic portrayal of the USSR prompted condemnation in the West from both the New Left and the political right . In 1976 , backed by Twist and Shout , it was issued as a single to promote the compilation album Rock ' n ' Roll Music . It peaked at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and number 11 in Ireland . In 2003 , following the fall of Communism in Europe , McCartney performed the song in Moscow 's Red Square .",
  "/wiki/The_Beatles_(album)": "The Beatles , also known as the White Album , is the ninth studio album and only double album by the English rock band the Beatles , released on 22 November 1968 . Its plain white sleeve has no graphics or text other than the band 's name embossed , [ a ] which was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band 's previous LP Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres , including folk , British blues , ska , music hall and the avant-garde . It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work , as well as among the greatest albums of all time . Most of the songs on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh , India . There , the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar ; some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo , or only by part of the group . The production aesthetic ensured that the album 's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation , relative to all their releases since 1966 's Revolver . The Beatles also broke with the band 's recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre . At the end of May 1968 , the Beatles returned to EMI Studios in London to commence recording sessions that lasted through to mid-October . During these sessions , arguments broke out among the foursome over creative differences and John Lennon 's new partner , Yoko Ono , whose constant presence subverted the Beatles ' policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio . After a series of problems , including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick suddenly quitting , Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August .",

The album incorporates genres such as blues , rock and pop , and makes prominent use of Moog synthesizer , sounds filtered through a Leslie speaker , and tom-tom drums .

  "/wiki/Dear_Prudence": "Dear Prudence is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles ( also known as the White Album ) . The song was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon-McCartney partnership . Written in Rishikesh during the group 's trip to India in early 1968 , it was inspired by actress Mia Farrow 's sister , Prudence Farrow , who became obsessive about meditating while practising with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Her designated partners on the meditation course , Lennon and George Harrison , attempted to coax Farrow out of her seclusion , which led to Lennon writing the song . Lennon wrote Dear Prudence using a finger-picking guitar technique that he learned from singer-songwriter Donovan . Its lyrics are simple and innocent and celebrate the beauty of nature . The Beatles recorded the song at Trident Studios in late August 1968 as a three-piece after Ringo Starr temporarily left the group out of protest at McCartney 's criticism of his drumming on Back in the U.S.S.R. and the tensions that typified the sessions for the White Album .

Like most of the band 's previous releases , the album topped record charts in many countries , including both the US and the UK . However , the critical response was generally unfavourable , and Let It Be came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums ever . Rehearsals began at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969 as part of a planned documentary showing the Beatles ' return to live performance . Paul McCartney conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the band by returning to simpler rock and roll configurations . The filmed rehearsals were marked by ill-feeling , leading to George Harrison 's temporary departure from the group . As a condition of his return , the members reconvened at their own Apple Studio with guest keyboardist Billy Preston . The project then yielded a single public concert , held impromptu on the studio 's rooftop on 30 January , from which three of the album 's tracks were drawn . In April 1969 , the Beatles issued the single Get Back , after which engineer Glyn Johns proposed rejected mixes of the album , then titled Get Back , that were widely bootlegged before release .

In August 1966 , the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday .

The single was commercially successful around the world , topping charts in the United States , the United Kingdom , New Zealand , Canada , Australia and several other countries . McCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme . The song originated when , in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting , McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said . The completed song includes a musical coda , which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967 . Unimpressed with the composition , Lennon pushed for I Am the Walrus to be the single 's A-side , before reluctantly accepting that Hello , Goodbye was the more commercial-sounding of the two sides . The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song , one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America .

  "/wiki/Magical_Mystery_Tour": "Magical Mystery Tour is a record by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double EP in the United Kingdom and an LP in the United States . It includes the soundtrack to the 1967 film of the same name . The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the Parlophone label , while the Capitol Records LP release in the US occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year . It was not released as an eleven-track LP in the UK until 1976 . In their new songs , the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since Revolver ( 1966 ) . Paul McCartney led the project and contributed three songs , while John Lennon and George Harrison contributed I Am the Walrus and Blue Jay Way , respectively . The sessions were often characterised as aimless and undisciplined , including by producer George Martin , whose input on the band 's recordings began to wane . Further to the Beatles ' desire to experiment with record formats and packaging , the EP and LP included a 24-page booklet that contained song lyrics , colour photos from film production , and colour story illustrations by Beatles Book cartoonist Bob Gibson . Despite widespread media criticism of the Magical Mystery Tour film , the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success . In the UK , it topped the EPs chart compiled by Record Retailer and peaked at number 2 on the magazine 's singles chart ( later the UK Singles Chart ) behind the band 's Hello , Goodbye . The album topped Billboard 's Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969 .",

It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon-McCartney . The song was a product of McCartney 's attempt to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible . The Beatles ' recording has been noted for its proto-metal roar and is considered by music historians to be a key influence in the early development of heavy metal . In 1976 , the song was released as the B-side of Got to Get You into My Life in the United States , to promote the Capitol Records compilation Rock ' n ' Roll Music . Along with other tracks from the White Album , Helter Skelter was interpreted by cult leader Charles Manson as a message predicting inter-racial war in the US .

  "/wiki/Here_Comes_the_Sun": "Here Comes the Sun is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1969 album Abbey Road . It was written by George Harrison and is one of his best-known compositions for the Beatles . Harrison wrote the song in early 1969 at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton , where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles ' Apple Corps organisation . The lyrics reflect his relief at the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band 's business affairs . As of September 2019 , it was the most streamed Beatles song in the United Kingdom , with over 50 million plays . The Beatles recorded Here Comes the Sun at London 's EMI Studios in the summer of 1969 . Led by Harrison 's acoustic guitar , the track features Moog synthesizer , which he had introduced to the band 's sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California . Reflecting the continued influence of Indian classical music on Harrison 's writing , the composition includes several time signature changes . Here Comes the Sun has received acclaim from music critics . Combined with his other contribution to Abbey Road , Something , it gained for Harrison the level of recognition as a songwriter that had previously been reserved for his bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney . Harrison played the song during many of his relatively rare live performances as a solo artist , including at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 and , with Paul Simon , during his appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1976 . Richie Havens and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel each had hit singles with Here Comes the Sun in the 1970s ."
