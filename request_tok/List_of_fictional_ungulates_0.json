He is less straightforward than most characters in the novel , and a number of interpretations have been put forward to which social class he represents as regards to the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union . ( Animal Farm is an allegory for the evolution of Communism in Russia , with each animal representing a different social class , e.g . Boxer represents the working class . ) Benjamin also represents the old people of Russia because he remembers the old laws that have been changed",
  "/wiki/Animal_Farm": "Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell , first published in England on 17 August 1945 . The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy . Ultimately , however , the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before , under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon . According to Orwell , the fable reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union . Orwell , a democratic socialist , was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism , an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War . [ a ] The Soviet Union , he believed , had become a brutal dictatorship , built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror . In a letter to Yvonne Davet , Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin ( un conte satirique contre Staline ) , and in his essay Why I Write ( 1946 ) , wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried , with full consciousness of what he was doing , to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole . The original title was Animal Farm : A Fairy Story , but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946 , and only one of the translations during Orwell 's lifetime kept it . Other titular variations include subtitles like A Satire and A Contemporary Satire . Orwell suggested the title Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales for the French translation , which abbreviates to URSA , the Latin word for bear , a symbol of Russia . It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union , Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques . Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944 , when the UK was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon Orwell hated",
  "/wiki/George_Orwell": "Eric Arthur Blair ( 25 June 1903 - 21 January 1950 ) , better known by his pen name George Orwell , was an English novelist and essayist , journalist and critic . His work is characterised by lucid prose , awareness of social injustice , opposition to totalitarianism , and outspoken support of democratic socialism . As a writer , Orwell produced literary criticism and poetry , fiction and polemical journalism ; and is best known for the allegorical novella Animal Farm ( 1945 ) and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four ( 1949 ) . His non-fiction works , including The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) , documenting his experience of working-class life in the north of England , and Homage to Catalonia ( 1938 ) , an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War ( 1936-1939 ) , are as critically respected as his essays on politics and literature , language and culture . In 2008 , The Times ranked George Orwell second among The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 . Orwell 's work remains influential in popular culture and in political culture , and the adjective Orwellian - describing totalitarian and authoritarian social practices - is part of the English language , like many of his neologisms , such as Big Brother , Thought Police , and Hate week , Room 101 , the memory hole , and Newspeak , doublethink and proles , unperson and thoughtcrime",

  "/wiki/Aesop's_Fables": "Aesop 's Fables , or the Aesopica , is a collection of fables credited to Aesop , a slave and storyteller believed to have lived in ancient Greece between 620 and 564 BCE . Of diverse origins , the stories associated with his name have descended to modern times through a number of sources and continue to be reinterpreted in different verbal registers and in popular as well as artistic media . The fables originally belonged to the oral tradition and were not collected for some three centuries after Aesop 's death . By that time a variety of other stories , jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him , although some of that material was from sources earlier than him or came from beyond the Greek cultural sphere . The process of inclusion has continued until the present , with some of the fables unrecorded before the Late Middle Ages and others arriving from outside Europe . The process is continuous and new stories are still being added to the Aesop corpus , even when they are demonstrably more recent work and sometimes from known authors . Manuscripts in Latin and Greek were important avenues of transmission , although poetical treatments in European vernaculars eventually formed another . On the arrival of printing , collections of Aesop 's fables were among the earliest books in a variety of languages . Through the means of later collections , and translations or adaptations of them , Aesop 's reputation as a fabulist was transmitted throughout the world . Initially the fables were addressed to adults and covered religious , social and political themes . They were also put to use as ethical guides and from the Renaissance onwards were particularly used for the education of children . Their ethical dimension was reinforced in the adult world through depiction in sculpture , painting and other illustrative means , as well as adaptation to drama and song",

Although his existence remains unclear and no writings by him survive , numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day . Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak , solve problems , and generally have human characteristics . Scattered details of Aesop 's life can be found in ancient sources , including Aristotle , Herodotus , and Plutarch . An ancient literary work called The Aesop Romance tells an episodic , probably highly fictional version of his life , including the traditional description of him as a strikingly ugly slave ( \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ) who by his cleverness acquires freedom and becomes an adviser to kings and city-states .

Notably high populations of white-tailed deer occur in the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas . Michigan , Minnesota , Iowa , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , Illinois , Wisconsin , Maryland , New York , North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Indiana also boast high deer densities . The conversion of land adjacent to the Canadian Rockies into agriculture use and partial clear-cutting of coniferous trees ( resulting in widespread deciduous vegetation ) has been favorable to the white-tailed deer and has pushed its distribution to as far north as Yukon . Populations of deer around the Great Lakes have also expanded their range northwards , due to conversion of land to agricultural uses favoring more deciduous vegetation , and local caribou and moose populations . The westernmost population of the species , known as the Columbian white-tailed deer , once was widespread in the mixed forests along the Willamette and Cowlitz River valleys of western Oregon and southwestern Washington , but today its numbers have been considerably reduced , and it is classified as near-threatened .
