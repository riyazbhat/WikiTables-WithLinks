  "/wiki/Member_State_of_the_European_Union": "The European Union ( EU ) consists of 27 member states . Each member state is party to the founding treaties of the union and thereby shares in the privileges and obligations of membership . Unlike members of most international organisations , the member states of the EU have agreed by treaty to shared sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some ( but by no means all ) aspects of government . Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt some policies ; for others , collective decision making is by qualified majority voting . Subsidiarity , meaning that decisions are taking collectively if and only if they can not realistically be taken individually , is a founding principle of the EU . In 1957 , six core states founded the EU 's predecessor , the European Economic Community ( Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany ) . The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements . To accede , a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria , which require a candidate to have a democratic , free-market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions , and respect for the rule of law . Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate 's adoption of the existing body of EU law , known as the acquis communautaire . Until 2020 , no member state had withdrawn or been suspended from the EU , though some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas had previously left . The UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 2017 to formally initiate the Brexit process . Completion occurred on 31 January 2020 ( London time ) , with all other arrangements remaining in place during a transition period while a free trade agreement is negotiated .",
  "/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_accession": "The European Union ( EU ) has expanded a number of times throughout its history by way of the accession of new member states to the Union . To join the EU , a state needs to fulfil economic and political conditions called the Copenhagen criteria ( after the Copenhagen summit in June 1993 ) , which require a stable democratic government that respects the rule of law , and its corresponding freedoms and institutions . According to the Maastricht Treaty , each current member state and the European Parliament must agree to any enlargement . The process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as European integration . This term is also used to refer to the intensification of co-operation between EU member states as national governments allow for the gradual harmonisation of national laws . The EU 's predecessor , the European Economic Community , was founded with the Inner Six member states in 1958 , when the Treaty of Rome came into force . Since then , the EU 's membership has grown to twenty-eight , with the latest member state being Croatia , which joined in July 2013 . The most recent territorial enlargement of the EU was the incorporation of Mayotte in 2014 . The most notable territorial reductions of the EU , and its predecessors , were the exit of Algeria upon independence in 1962 , the exit of Greenland in 1985 , and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020 . As of 2020 [ update ] , accession negotiations are under way with Serbia ( since 2014 ) , Montenegro ( since 2012 ) and Turkey ( since 2005 ) . Serbia and Montenegro have been described by President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and Enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn as the front-runner candidates , and projected that they would join by 2025 , during the next mandate of the European Commission . Negotiations with Turkey have also been ongoing at a slower pace , particularly since the 2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt due to objections from the EU to the Turkish government 's response .",

Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons . The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language . Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments .",

The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",

Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

  "/wiki/Italian_lira": "The lira ( Italian : [ \u02c8li\u02d0ra ] ; plural lire [ \u02c8li\u02d0re ] ) was the currency of Italy between 1861 and 2002 and of the Albanian Kingdom between 1941 and 1943 . Between 1999 and 2002 , the Italian lira was officially a national subunit of the euro . However , cash payments could be made in lira only , as euro coins or notes were not yet available . The lira was also the currency of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy between 1807 and 1814 . The term originates from the value of a pound weight ( Latin : libra ) of high purity silver and is thus directly related to the British pound sterling from the Germanic silabar ; in some countries , such as Cyprus and Malta , the words lira and pound were used as equivalents , before the euro was adopted in 2008 in the two countries . L , sometimes in a double-crossed script form ( \u20a4 ) , was the symbol most often used . Until the Second World War , it was subdivided into 100 centesimi ( singular : centesimo ) , which translates to hundredths or cents . The lira was established at 4.5 grams of silver or 290.322 milligrams of gold . This was a direct continuation of the Sardinian lira . Other currencies replaced by the Italian lira included the Lombardy-Venetia pound , the Two Sicilies piastra , the Tuscan fiorino , the Papal States scudo and the Parman lira . In 1865 , Italy formed part of the Latin Monetary Union in which the lira was set as equal to , among others , the French , Belgian and Swiss francs : in fact , in various Gallo-Italic languages in north-western Italy , the lira was outright called franc .

Also , minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil , and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian . Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though regional variants of the standard language exist .

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law .
