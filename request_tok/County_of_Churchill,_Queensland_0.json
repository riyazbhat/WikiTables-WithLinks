  "/wiki/Local_government_in_Australia": "Local government in Australia is the third tier of government in Australia administered by the states and territories , which in turn are beneath the federal tier . Local government is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia and two referenda in the 1970s and 1980s to alter the Constitution relating to local government were unsuccessful . Every state government recognises local government in their respective constitutions . Unlike Canada or the United States , there is only one level of local government in each state , with no distinction such as cities and counties . The local governing body is generally referred to as a council , and the territories governed are collectively referred to as local government areas ; however , terms such as city or shire also have a geographic interpretation . In August 2016 there were 547 local councils in Australia . Despite the single level of local government in Australia , there are a number of extensive areas with relatively low populations which are not a part of any local government area . Powers of local governments in these areas may be exercised by special purpose bodies established outside the general legislation , as with Victoria 's alpine resorts , or directly by state governments . The area covered by local councils in Australia ranges from as small as 1.5 km2 ( 0.58 sq mi ) for the Shire of Peppermint Grove in metropolitan Perth , to the Shire of East Pilbara in the Pilbara region of Western Australia , which covers 380,000 km2 ( 150,000 sq mi ) , an area larger than Germany or Japan",
