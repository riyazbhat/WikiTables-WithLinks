  "/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway": "The Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) ( reporting marks CP , CPAA , MILW , SOO ) , also known formerly as CP Rail between 1968 and 1996 , and known as simply Canadian Pacific is a historic Canadian Class I railway incorporated in 1881 . The railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited , which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001 . Headquartered in Calgary , Alberta , it owns approximately 20,000 kilometres ( 12,500 mi ) of track all across Canada and into the United States , stretching from Montreal to Vancouver , and as far north as Edmonton . Its rail network also serves Minneapolis-St. Paul , Milwaukee , Detroit , Chicago , and New York City in the United States . The railway was first built between eastern Canada and British Columbia between 1881 and 1885 ( connecting with Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay area lines built earlier ) , fulfilling a trusty extended to British Columbia when it entered Confederation in 1871 . It was Canada 's first transcontinental railway , but no longer reaches the Atlantic coast . Primarily a freight railway , the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada , and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada . The CPR became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada , a position it held as late as 1975 . Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986 , after being assumed by Via Rail Canada in 1978 . A beaver was chosen as the railway 's logo in honour of Sir Donald A Smith ( 1st . Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal ) who had risen from Factor to Governor of the Hudson 's Bay Company over a lengthy career in the beaver fur trade . Smith was a principal financier of the C.P.R",

It was driven in by CPR railroad financier Donald Smith , marking the end of a saga of natural disasters , financial crises , and even rebellion that plagued Canada 's first transcontinental railroad from its beginning",
  "/wiki/Standard_Time": "Standard time is the synchronization of clocks within a geographical area or region to a single time standard , rather than using solar time or a locally chosen meridian ( longitude ) to establish a local mean time standard . Generally , standard time agrees with the local mean time at some meridian that passes through the region , often near the center of the region . Historically , the concept was established during the 19th century to aid weather forecasting and train travel . Applied globally in the 20th century , the geographical areas became extended around evenly spaced meridians into time zones which ( usually ) centered on them . The standard time set in each time zone has come to be defined in terms of offsets from Universal Time . In regions where daylight saving time is used , that time is defined by another offset , from the standard time in its applicable time zones . The adoption of standard time , because of the inseparable correspondence between time and longitude , solidified the concepts of halving the globe into an eastern and western hemisphere , with one prime meridian ( as well its opposite International Date Line ) replacing the various prime meridians that had previously been used",
  "/wiki/Sanford_Fleming": "Sir Sandford Fleming KCMG ( January 7 , 1827 - July 22 , 1915 ) was a Scottish Canadian engineer and inventor . Born and raised in Scotland , he emigrated to colonial Canada at the age of 18 . He promoted worldwide standard time zones , a prime meridian , and use of the 24-hour clock as key elements to communicating the accurate time , all of which influenced the creation of Coordinated Universal Time . He designed Canada 's first postage stamp , left a huge body of surveying and map making , engineered much of the Intercolonial Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway , and was a founding member of the Royal Society of Canada and founder of the Canadian Institute , a science organization in Toronto",
  "/wiki/Time_zone": "A time zone is a region of the globe that observes a uniform standard time for legal , commercial , and social purposes . Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions instead of longitude , because it is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time . Most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) by a whole number of hours ( UTC\u221212:00 to UTC+14:00 ) , but a few zones are offset by 30 or 45 minutes ( e.g . Newfoundland Standard Time is UTC\u221203:30 , Nepal Standard Time is UTC+05:45 , Indian Standard Time is UTC+05:30 and Myanmar Standard Time is UTC+06:30 ) . Some higher latitude and temperate zone countries use daylight saving time for part of the year , typically by adjusting local clock time by an hour . Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding nautical time zones . This also creates a permanent daylight saving time effect",
  "/wiki/Steam_locomotive": "A steam locomotive is a type of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine . These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material - usually coal , wood , or oil - to produce steam in a boiler . The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive 's main wheels ( drivers ) . Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive , either on the locomotive itself or in wagons ( tenders ) pulled behind . Steam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century . Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive in 1802 . The first commercially successful steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. , the Salamanca ( locomotive ) , the Locomotion No . 1 , built by George Stephenson and his son Robert 's company Robert Stephenson and Company , was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway , the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 . In 1830 , George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway , the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives for railways in the United Kingdom , the United States , and much of Europe in the first decades of steam . In the 20th century , Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Nigel Gresley designed some of the most famous locomotives , including the Flying Scotsman , the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service , and a LNER Class A4 , 4468 Mallard , which still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world ( 126 mph ) . From the early 1900s , steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives , with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s",

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation .

The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8 % of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11 % of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation"
