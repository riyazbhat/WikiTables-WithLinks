Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the Dean of American Composers . The open , slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music , evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit . He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as populist and which the composer labeled his vernacular style . Works in this vein include the ballets Appalachian Spring , Billy the Kid and Rodeo , his Fanfare for the Common Man and Third Symphony . In addition to his ballets and orchestral works , he produced music in many other genres , including chamber music , vocal works , opera and film scores . After some initial studies with composer Rubin Goldmark , Copland traveled to Paris , where he first studied with Isidor Philipp and Paul Vidal , then with noted pedagogue Nadia Boulanger . He studied three years with Boulanger , whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste . Determined upon his return to the U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer , Copland gave lecture-recitals , wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing . He found composing orchestral music in the modernist style he had adapted abroad a financially contradictory approach , particularly in light of the Great Depression . He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ( music for use ) , music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes . During the Depression years , he traveled extensively to Europe , Africa , and Mexico , formed an important friendship with Mexican composer Carlos Ch\u00e1vez and began composing his signature works .",

  "/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley": "Tin Pan Alley was the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century . The name originally referred to a specific place : West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Flower District of Manhattan ; a plaque ( see below ) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it .

The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885 , when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan . The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut . Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph , radio , and motion pictures supplanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music , while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll , which was centered on the Brill Building .",

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century . He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art , and leader of the Second Viennese School . With the rise of the Nazi Party , Schoenberg 's works were labeled degenerate music , because they were modernist and atonal . He emigrated to the United States in 1933 , becoming an American citizen in 1941 . Schoenberg 's approach , b\u03bfth in terms of harmony and development , has been one of the most influential of 20th-century musical thought . Many European and American composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking , whereas others have passionately reacted against it . Schoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner . Later , his name would come to personify innovations in atonality ( although Schoenberg himself detested that term ) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music . In the 1920s , Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique , an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale . He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea . Schoenberg was also an influential teacher of composition ; his students included Alban Berg , Anton Webern , Hanns Eisler , Egon Wellesz , Nikos Skalkottas , Stefania Turkewich , and later John Cage , Lou Harrison , Earl Kim , Robert Gerhard , Leon Kirchner , Dika Newlin , and other prominent musicians .",

  "/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique": "The twelve-tone technique - also known as dodecaphony , twelve-tone serialism , and ( in British usage ) twelve-note composition - is a method of musical composition first devised by Austrian composer Josef Matthias Hauer , [ not verified in body ] who published his law of the twelve tones in 1919 . In 1923 , Arnold Schoenberg ( 1874-1951 ) developed his own , better-known version of 12-tone technique , which became associated with the Second Viennese School composers , who were the primary users of the technique in the first decades of its existence . The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows , orderings of the 12 pitch classes . All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance , and the music avoids being in a key . Over time , the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers . Many important composers who had originally not subscribed to or even actively opposed the technique , such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky , [ clarification needed ] eventually adopted it in their music . Schoenberg himself described the system as a Method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another . It is commonly considered a form of serialism . Schoenberg 's fellow countryman and contemporary Josef Matthias Hauer also developed a similar system using unordered hexachords or tropes - but with no connection to Schoenberg 's twelve-tone technique . [ contradictory ] Other composers have created systematic use of the chromatic scale , but Schoenberg 's method is considered to be historically and aesthetically most significant ."
