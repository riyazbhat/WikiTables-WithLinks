  "/wiki/Prairie_du_Chien,_Wisconsin": "Prairie du Chien ( /\u02ccpr\u025bri du \u02c8\u0283i\u02d0n/ ) is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County , Wisconsin , United States . The population was 5,911 at the 2010 census . Its ZIP Code is 53821 . Often referred to as Wisconsin 's second oldest city , Prairie du Chien was established as a European settlement by French voyageurs in the late seventeenth century . The city is located near the confluence of the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers , a strategic point along the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway that connects the Great Lakes with the Mississippi . Early French visitors to the site found it occupied by a group of Fox Indians led by a chief whose name Alim meant chien in French ( dog in English ) . The French explorers named the location Prairie du Chien , French for Dog 's Prairie . Originally this name applied only to the plain upon which the settlement is located , but it was later applied to the city as well . The city of Prairie du Chien is located between the Town of Prairie du Chien and the Town of Bridgeport .",

  "/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor": "John Jacob Astor ( born Johann Jakob Astor ; July 17 , 1763 - March 29 , 1848 ) was a German-American businessman , merchant , real estate mogul and investor who mainly made his fortune in fur trade and by investing in real estate in or around New York City . Born in Germany , Astor immigrated to England as a teenager and worked as a musical instrument manufacturer . He moved to the United States after the American Revolutionary War . He entered the fur trade and built a monopoly , managing a business empire that extended to the Great Lakes region and Canada , and later expanded into the American West and Pacific coast . Seeing the decline of demand , he got out of the fur trade in 1830 , diversifying by investing in New York City real estate and later becoming a famed patron of the arts . He was the first prominent member of the Astor family and the first multi-millionaire in the United States .",
  "/wiki/American_Fur_Company": "The American Fur Company ( AFC ) was founded in 1808 , by John Jacob Astor , a German immigrant to the United States . During the 18th century , furs had become a major commodity in Europe , and North America became a major supplier . Several British companies , most notably the North West Company and the Hudson 's Bay Company , were eventual competitors against Astor and capitalized on the lucrative trade in furs . Astor capitalized on anti-British sentiments and his commercial strategies to become one of the first trusts in American business and a major competitor to the British commercial dominance in North American fur trade . Expanding into many former British fur-trapping regions and trade routes , the company grew to monopolize the fur trade in the United States by 1830 , and became one of the largest and wealthiest businesses in the country . Astor planned for several companies to function across the Great Lakes , the Great Plains and the Oregon Country to gain control of the North American fur trade . Comparatively inexpensive manufactured goods were to be shipped to commercial stations for trade with various Indigenous nations for fur pelts . The sizable number of furs collected were then to be brought to the port of Guangzhou , as pelts were in high demand in the Qing Empire . Chinese products were , in turn , to be purchased for resale throughout Europe and the United States . A beneficial agreement with the Russian-American Company was also planned through the regular supply of provisions for posts in Russian America . This was planned in part to prevent the rival Montreal based North West Company ( NWC ) to gain a presence along the Pacific Coast , a prospect neither Russian colonial authorities or Astor favored . Demand for furs in Europe began to decline during the early 19th century , leading to the stagnation of the fur trade by the mid-19th century .",
  "/wiki/Fur": "Fur is a thick growth of hair that covers the skin of many animals . It is a defining characteristic of mammals . It consists of a combination of oily guard hair on top and thick underfur beneath . The guard hair keeps moisture and the underfur acts as an insulating blanket that keeps the animal warm . The fur of mammals has many uses : protection , sensory purposes , waterproofing , and camouflaging , with the primary usage being thermoregulation . The types of hair include definitive , which may be shed after reaching a certain length ; vibrissae , which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers ; pelage , which consists of guard hairs , under-fur , and awn hair ; spines , which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in , for example , porcupines ; bristles , which are long hairs usually used in visual signals , such as the mane of a lion ; velli , often called down fur , which insulates newborn mammals ; and wool , which is long , soft , and often curly . :99 Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation , as some tropical mammals , such as sloths , have the same fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation ; and , conversely , other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals . The denseness of fur can increase an animal 's insulation value , and arctic mammals especially have dense fur ; for example , the musk ox has guard hairs measuring 30 cm ( 12 in ) as well as a dense underfur , which forms an airtight coat , allowing them to survive in temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C ( \u221240 \u00b0F ) . :162-163 Some desert mammals , such as camels , use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin , allowing the animal to stay cool ; a camel 's fur may reach 70 \u00b0C ( 158 \u00b0F ) in the summer , but the skin stays at 40 \u00b0C ( 104 \u00b0F ) . :188 Aquatic mammals , conversely , trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry . :162-163",

  "/wiki/Fur_trade": "The fur trade is a worldwide industry dealing in the acquisition and sale of animal fur . Since the establishment of a world fur market in the early modern period , furs of boreal , polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued . Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of Siberia , northern North America , and the South Shetland and South Sandwich Islands . Today the importance of the fur trade has diminished ; it is based on pelts produced at fur farms and regulated fur-bearer trapping , but has become controversial . Animal rights organizations oppose the fur trade , citing that animals are brutally killed and sometimes skinned alive . Fur has been replaced in some clothing by synthetic imitations , for example , as in ruffs on hoods of parkas .",

  "/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States": "Native Americans , also known as American Indians , Indigenous Americans and other terms , are the indigenous peoples of the United States , except Hawaii and territories of the United States . More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US , about half of which are associated with Indian reservations . The term American Indian excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives , while Native Americans ( as defined by the US Census ) are American Indians , plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities . The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro , instead being included in the Census grouping of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander . The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago , possibly much earlier , from Asia via Beringia . A vast variety of peoples , societies and cultures subsequently developed . Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas , which began in 1492 , and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare , including biological warfare , territorial confiscation and slavery . After its creation , the United States , as part of its policy of settler colonialism , waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples , removed them from their ancestral lands , and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century . Since the 1960s , Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans , though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans . Today , there are over five million Native Americans in the United States , 78% of whom live outside reservations . When the United States was created , established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations , as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers . The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations , and started treating them as domestic dependent nations subject to federal law .",

  "/wiki/Wisconsin_River": "The Wisconsin River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the U.S. state of Wisconsin . At approximately 430 miles ( 692 km ) long , it is the state 's longest river . The river 's name , first recorded in 1673 by Jacques Marquette as Meskousing , is rooted in the Algonquian languages used by the area 's American Indian tribes , but its original meaning is obscure . French explorers who followed in the wake of Marquette later modified the name to Ouisconsin , and so it appears on Guillaume de L'Isle 's map ( Paris , 1718 ) . This was simplified to Wisconsin in the early 19th century before being applied to Wisconsin Territory and finally the state of Wisconsin . The Wisconsin River originates in the forests of the North Woods Lake District of northern Wisconsin , in Lac Vieux Desert near the border of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . It flows south across the glacial plain of central Wisconsin , passing through Wausau , Stevens Point , and Wisconsin Rapids . In southern Wisconsin it encounters the terminal moraine formed during the last ice age , where it forms the Dells of the Wisconsin River .

  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Projectile_point": "In archaeological terms , a projectile point is an object that was hafted to weapon that was capable of being thrown or projected , such as a spear , dart , or arrow , or perhaps used as a knife . They are thus different from weapons presumed to have been kept in the hand , such as axes and maces , and the stone mace or axe-heads often attached to them . Stone tools , including projectile points , can survive for long periods , were often lost or discarded , and are relatively plentiful , especially at archaeological sites , providing useful clues to the human past , including prehistoric trade . A distinctive form of point , identified though lithic analysis of the way it was made , is often a key diagnostic factor in identifying an archaeological industry or culture . Scientific techniques exist to track the specific kinds of rock or minerals that used to make stone tools in various regions back to their original sources . As well as stone , projectile points were also made of worked bone , antler or ivory ; all of these are less common in the Americas . In regions where metallurgy emerged , projectile points were eventually made from copper , bronze , or iron , though the change was by no means immediate . In North America , some late prehistoric points were fashioned from copper that was mined in the Lake Superior region and elsewhere .",
  "/wiki/Scraper_(archaeology)": "In prehistoric archaeology , scrapers are unifacial tools thought to have been used for hideworking and woodworking . Many lithic analysts maintain that the only true scrapers are defined on the base of use-wear , and usually are those that were worked on the distal ends of blades - i.e. , end scrapers ( French : grattoir ) . Other scrapers include the so-called side scrapers or racloirs , which are made on the longest side of a flake , and notched scrapers , which have a cleft on either side that may have been used to attach them to something else . Scrapers are typically formed by chipping the end of a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it . Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape . The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex , and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting . One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper , a scraper shaped much like its namesake . This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America . Scrapers are one of the most varied lithic tools found at archaeological sites . Due to the vast array of scrapers there are many typologies that scrapers can fall under , including tool size , tool shape , tool base , the number of working edges , edge angle , edge shape , and many more .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on .

His letters , essays , and books describing his adventures in nature , especially in the Sierra Nevada , have been read by millions . His activism has helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley , Sequoia National Park and many other wilderness areas . The Sierra Club , which he co-founded , is a prominent American conservation organization . In his later life , Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests . As part of the campaign to make Yosemite a national park , Muir published two landmark articles on wilderness preservation in The Century Magazine , The Treasures of the Yosemite and Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park ; this helped support the push for U.S. Congress to pass a bill in 1890 establishing Yosemite National Park . The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings has inspired readers , including presidents and congressmen , to take action to help preserve large nature areas . John Muir has been considered an inspiration to both Scots and Americans . Muir 's biographer , Steven J. Holmes , believes that Muir has become one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity , both political and recreational . As a result , his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals , and he is often quoted by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams . Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world , writes Holmes . Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker , political spokesman , and religious prophet , whose writings became a personal guide into nature for countless individuals , making his name almost ubiquitous in the modern environmental consciousness .",

His top priority as president was preserving the Union , but he died sixteen months into his term , before making any progress on the status of slavery , which had been inflaming tensions in Congress . Taylor was born into a prominent family of plantation owners who moved westward from Virginia to Louisville , Kentucky in his youth . He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812 . He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832 .

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",
  "/wiki/Relief_sculpture": "Relief is a sculptural technique where the sculpted elements remain attached to a solid background of the same material . The term relief is from the Latin verb relevo , to raise . To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background plane . What is actually performed when a relief is cut in from a flat surface of stone ( relief sculpture ) or wood ( relief carving ) is a lowering of the field , leaving the unsculpted parts seemingly raised . The technique involves considerable chiselling away of the background , which is a time-consuming exercise . On the other hand , a relief saves forming the rear of a subject , and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round , especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point , especially in stone . In other materials such as metal , clay , plaster stucco , ceramics or papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 the form can be just added to or raised up from the background , and monumental bronze reliefs are made by casting . There are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field , for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English . The full range includes high relief ( alto-rilievo , haut-relief ) , where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas , mid-relief ( mezzo-rilievo ) , low-relief ( basso-rilievo , or French : bas-relief ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ ba\u0281lij\u025bf ] ) , and shallow-relief or rilievo schiacciato , where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements . There is also sunk relief , which was mainly restricted to Ancient Egypt ( see below ) . However , the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important , and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work . The definition of these terms is somewhat variable , and many works combine areas in more than one of them , sometimes sliding between them in a single figure ; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions .",
