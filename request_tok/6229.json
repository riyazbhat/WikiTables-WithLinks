During that period , it had won four national titles and five national cups . For the next two decades , its tradition was taken further by FC U Craiova , which was reorganised several times , disaffiliated and retroactively deemed as an unofficial successor . In 2013 , the sports club refounded the football department , which asserts to be the continuation of the original Universitatea Craiova - this has since been backed up by some court orders and the Liga Profesionist\u0103 de Fotbal , however the record is still subject of dispute with the also reestablished FC U entity and uncertainty persists . [ note 2 ] In 2018 , the White-Blues won the Cupa Rom\u00e2niei , representing their first trophy following the refoundation . On the European stage , Universitatea Craiova 's best performances are reaching the semi-finals of the 1982-83 UEFA Cup and the quarter-finals of the 1981-82 European Cup . They were the first Romanian team to reach the semi-finals of a UEFA tournament and remain the only one to have knocked out at least one club from each of five strongest countries in European football : England , France , Germany , Italy and Spain . The Students play their home matches at the Stadionul Ion Oblemenco , which has a capacity of 30,929 . Craiova holds several rivalries , the most notable being the one with Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti .",
