  "/wiki/Gross_register_tonnage": "Gross register tonnage ( GRT , grt , g.r.t. , gt ) or gross registered tonnage , is a ship 's total internal volume expressed in register tons , each of which is equal to 100 cubic feet ( 2.83 m3 ) . Gross register tonnage uses the total permanently enclosed capacity of the vessel as its basis for volume . Typically this is used for dockage fees , canal transit fees , and similar purposes where it is appropriate to charge based on the size of the entire vessel . Net register tonnage subtracts the volume of spaces not available for carrying cargo , such as engine rooms , fuel tanks and crew quarters , from gross register tonnage . Gross register tonnage is not a measure of the ship 's weight or displacement and should not be confused with terms such as deadweight tonnage or displacement",
