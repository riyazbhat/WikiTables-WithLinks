  "/wiki/Gifu,_Gifu": "Gifu ( \u5c90\u961c\u5e02 , Gifu-shi ) is a city located in the south-central portion of Gifu Prefecture , Japan , and serves as the prefectural capital . The city has played an important role in Japan 's history because of its location in the middle of the country . During the Sengoku period , various warlords , including Oda Nobunaga , used the area as a base in an attempt to unify and control Japan . Gifu continued to flourish even after Japan 's unification as both an important shukuba along the Edo period Nakasend\u014d and , later , as one of Japan 's fashion centers . It has been designated a core city by the national government . Located on the alluvial plain of the Nagara River , Gifu has taken advantage of the surrounding natural resources to create both traditional industries ( including Mino washi and agriculture ) and tourism opportunities such as cormorant fishing . Mount Kinka , one of the city 's major symbols , is home to a nationally designated forest and Gifu Castle , a replica of Nobunaga 's former castle . Gifu also hosts many festivals and events throughout the year . Two major rail lines connect Gifu to Japan 's national and international transportation infrastructure . JR Central 's T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line runs through the city , connecting it with Nagoya , one of Japan 's largest cities , and the surrounding area . The city has a direct train route to Chubu Centrair International Airport and facilities capable of hosting international events . Gifu has active relationships with six sister cities",
