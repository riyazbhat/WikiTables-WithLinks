York County is by far the largest county in the district , with almost one-third of its population , and its Republican bent has pushed the district as a whole into the Republican column in recent years . In November 2010 , the Republican Mick Mulvaney defeated longtime Congressman John Spratt and became the first Republican since Robert Smalls and the end of Reconstruction to represent the district . Following Mulvaney 's confirmation as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , a special election was held in 2017 to determine his successor .
