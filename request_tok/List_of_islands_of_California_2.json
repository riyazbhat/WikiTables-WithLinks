  "/wiki/Shasta_Lake": "Shasta Lake , also popularly known as Lake Shasta , is a reservoir in Shasta County , California , United States . It began to store water in 1944 due to the impounding of the Sacramento River by Shasta Dam , the ninth tallest dam in the United States . Shasta Lake is a key facility of the Central Valley Project and provides flood control for the Sacramento Valley downstream of the dam . Water outflow generates power through the Shasta Powerplant and is subsequently used for irrigation and municipal purposes . The reservoir lies within the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area , operated by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest . The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ( OEHHA ) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the lake based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species .",
  "/wiki/Pit_River_Bridge": "The Pit River Bridge ( officially the Veterans of Foreign Wars Memorial Bridge ) is a double deck , deck truss , road and rail bridge over Shasta Lake in Shasta County , California . The bridge , carrying Interstate 5 on its upper deck and Union Pacific Railroad on its lower deck , was built in 1942 as part of the construction of the Shasta Dam/Shasta Lake reservoir system . The Pit River Bridge was constructed to replace the Lower Pit River Bridge , as the rising waters of the Shasta Lake reservoir would have put the older bridge underwater . The entire bridge spans 3,588 feet ( 1,094 m ) long on the upper deck and 2,754 feet ( 839 m ) on the lower deck . With a height of 500 feet ( 150 m ) above the old Pit River bed , it is structurally the highest double decked bridge in the United States ; however , today the bridge sits only about 40 feet ( 12 m ) above the water when Shasta Lake is full . At the time it was built , the highway on the bridge was signed as U.S. Route 99 and the rail line was owned by Southern Pacific . The Coast Starlight , the passenger train line operated by Amtrak that runs from Los Angeles north to Seattle , also uses the bridge . The bridge is officially known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars Memorial Bridge , to honor military veterans from California who have fought in foreign wars . The Pit River Bridge was the subject of the 1954 Pulitzer Prize for Photography entitled Rescue on Pit River Bridge take by Virginia Schau .",

  "/wiki/Lake_Tahoe": "Lake Tahoe ( /\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0ho\u028a/ ; Washo : d\u00e1\u0294aw , 'the lake ' ) is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States . Lying at 6,225 ft ( 1,897 m ) , it straddles the state line between California and Nevada , west of Carson City . Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America , and at 122,160,280 acre\u22c5ft ( 150.7 km3 ) trails only the five Great Lakes as the largest by volume in the United States . Its depth is 1,645 ft ( 501 m ) , making it the second deepest in the United States after Crater Lake in Oregon ( 1,949 ft or 594 m ) . The lake was formed about two million years ago as part of the Lake Tahoe Basin , with the modern extent being shaped during the ice ages . It is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides . The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as Lake Tahoe , or simply Tahoe . More than 75% of the lake 's watershed is national forest land , comprising the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the United States Forest Service . Lake Tahoe is a major tourist attraction in both Nevada and California . It is home to winter sports , summer outdoor recreation , and scenery enjoyed throughout the year . Snow and ski resorts are a significant part of the area 's economy and reputation . The Nevada side also offers several lakeside casino resorts , with highways providing year-round access to the entire area .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Casitas": "Lake Casitas is a reservoir in Ventura County , California , built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and completed in 1959 . The project provides drinking water and water for irrigation . A secondary benefit is flood control . Casitas Dam was constructed on Coyote Creek , two miles ( 3 km ) before it joins the Ventura River . Santa Ana Creek and North Fork Coyote Creek also flow into the lake . The system was designed for water from the Ventura River to be diverted into a canal under specific conditions since the impounded watershed is not sufficient to fill the lake . The dam is 279 ft ( 85 m ) creating a lake capacity of 254,000 acre\u22c5ft ( 313,000,000 m3 ) . The dam was built as part of the Ventura River Project . In the center of Lake Casitas is 2 km Main Island , whose peak rises more than 500 feet ( 150 m ) from the lake surface .",
  "/wiki/Salton_Sea": "The Salton Sea is a shallow , saline , endorheic rift lake located directly on the San Andreas Fault , predominantly in the U.S. state of California 's Imperial and Coachella valleys . The lake occupies the lowest elevations of the Salton Sink in the Colorado Desert of Imperial and Riverside counties in Southern California . Its surface is 236.0 ft ( 71.9 m ) below sea level as of January 2018 . The deepest point of the sea is 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) higher than the lowest point of Death Valley . The sea is fed by the New , Whitewater , and Alamo rivers , as well as agricultural runoff , drainage systems , and creeks . Over millions of years , the Colorado River has flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited soil ( creating fertile farmland ) , building up the terrain and constantly changing the course of the river . For thousands of years , the river has alternately flowed into and out of the valley , alternately creating a freshwater lake , an increasingly saline lake , and a dry desert basin , depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss . The cycle of filling has been about every 400-500 years and has repeated many times . Around 700 AD , a major shift in the river 's course caused a flow of water into the basin , creating Lake Cahuilla , which at its peak was 115 miles ( 185 km ) long , as much as 35 miles ( 56 km ) wide , and 314 feet ( 96 m ) deep , making it one of the largest lakes in North America . The lake existed for over 600 years , until silt blocked the entry channel , creating a closed basin which dried up in around 50 years . The sudden existence of a lake in the arid Salton basin , during a time of an extended severe drought , was fortuitous for the hunter-gatherers who lived there , as it brought fish and waterfowl to the area ; however , the water itself was too saline to drink . The latest natural cycle occurred around 1600-1700 AD , according to Native Americans who spoke with the first European settlers .",
  "/wiki/Alamo_River": "The Alamo River ( Spanish : R\u00edo \u00c1lamo ) flows west and north from the Mexicali Valley ( Baja California ) across the Imperial Valley ( California ) . The 52-mile-long ( 84 km ) river drains into the Salton Sea . The New River , Alamo River , and Salton Sea of the 21st century started in autumn 1904 , when the Colorado River , swollen by seasonal rainfall and snow-melt , flowed through a series of three human-engineered openings in the recently constructed levee bank of the Alamo Canal . The resulting flood poured down the canal and breached an Imperial Valley dike . The sudden influx of water and the lack of any drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the Salton Sea ; the rivers had re-created a great inland sea in an area that it had frequently inundated before , the Salton Sink . It took slightly less than two years ( Mar 1905 to Feb 10 , 1907 ) to control the Colorado Rivers inflow to the Alamo Canal and stop the uncontrolled flooding of the Salton Sink , but the canal was effectively channelized with operational headgates by the early part of 1907 . The Alamo and New Rivers continued to flow , but at a lesser rate . The river was named after the Spanish name for the Fremont cottonwood that grows in the region . In most places , the river is a vegetation-choked ravine with a small watercourse at the bottom . The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory based on mercury , DDTs , PCBs , and selenium .",
  "/wiki/Negit_Island": "Negit Island is an island in Mono Lake . Negit ( along with nearby Paoha Island ) is a volcanic cone less than 2000 years old . It can be considered to be the northernmost of the Mono Craters . Negit is composed of three dark dacite lava flows . Negit is an important nesting ground for migratory birds , including the California gull , which can often be seen wheeling in the air above Mono Lake . The fall of the lake level since 1941 created a land bridge to the island . The land bridge permitted predators , such as coyotes , to raid the bird eggs of the island . However , since 1994 , the lake level has been permitted to rise and the land bridge is currently submerged .",
  "/wiki/Mono_Lake": "Mono Lake ( /\u02c8mo\u028ano\u028a/ MOH-noh ) is a saline soda lake in Mono County , California , formed at least 760,000 years ago as a terminal lake in an endorheic basin . The lack of an outlet causes high levels of salts to accumulate in the lake . These salts also make the lake water alkaline . This desert lake has an unusually productive ecosystem based on brine shrimp that thrive in its waters , and provides critical habitat for two million annual migratory birds that feed on the shrimp and alkali flies ( Ephydra hians ) . Historically , the native Kutzadika ' a people derived nutrition from the alkali flies ' pupae , which live in the shallow waters around the edge of the lake . When the city of Los Angeles diverted water from the freshwater streams flowing into the lake , it lowered the lake level , which imperiled the migratory birds . The Mono Lake Committee formed in response and won a legal battle that forced Los Angeles to partially replenish the lake level .",
  "/wiki/Volcanic_cone": "Volcanic cones are among the simplest volcanic landforms . They are built by ejecta from a volcanic vent , piling up around the vent in the shape of a cone with a central crater . Volcanic cones are of different types , depending upon the nature and size of the fragments ejected during the eruption . Types of volcanic cones include stratocones , spatter cones , tuff cones , and cinder cones .",

  "/wiki/Rattlesnake_Island_(Clear_Lake)": "Rattlesnake Island is an island located on Clear Lake in Lake County , northern California . Its land area is nominally 53 acres ( 210,000 square metres ) , but may vary significantly as lake levels rise and fall . It is 500 feet ( 150 metres ) offshore from the north shore of the eastern arm of Clear Lake , the site of the Elem Indian Colony . There is evidence of Native American activity on the island [ citation needed ] , possibly dating back as much as 8,000 years , although little archaeological work has been conducted . This site is connected with the prehistoric Post Pattern , and has probably been used by the Southeastern Pomo throughout prehistoric times [ citation needed ] . The Elem Pomo Colony have claimed the island to be their place of origin , and a political and religious center [ citation needed ] . A history of ownership disputes dates as far back as the late nineteenth century . Due to a controversial 1949 U.S. court decision , the Elem Pomo tribe lost legal control of 80,000 acres ( 32,375 hectares ) of its ancestral land , including the island [ citation needed ] . At present , legal title to the island is held by a Bay Area businessman , John Nady ( founder of Nady Systems Inc. ) His 2003 attempt to obtain permits to construct a log cabin on the island was challenged by Elem Indian Colony members but eventually granted . John Parker , a local archaeologist , petitioned the federal government to add the island to the National Register of Historical Places . John Nady is currently developing a sustainable vacation home there with solar power and resident livestock .",

  "/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault": "The San Andreas Fault is a continental transform fault that extends roughly 1,200 kilometers ( 750 mi ) through California . It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate , and its motion is right-lateral strike-slip ( horizontal ) . The fault divides into three segments , each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk . The slip rate along the fault ranges from 20 to 35 mm ( 0.79 to 1.38 in ) /yr . The fault was identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley , who discovered the northern zone . It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake , a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates . However , according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908 , Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley . Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California . In 1953 , geologist Thomas Dibblee concluded that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault . A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD ) near Parkfield , Monterey County , was drilled through the fault during 2004-2007 to collect material and make physical and chemical observations to better understand fault behavior .",
  "/wiki/Trinity_Lake": "Trinity Lake , previously called Clair Engle Lake , is an artificial lake on the Trinity River formed by the Trinity Dam and located in Trinity County , California , United States . The dam was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation . The lake 's capacity is 2,447,650 acre\u22c5ft ( 3,019.13 GL ) , making it one of the largest reservoirs in California . The lake 's surface is at 2,370 ft ( 720 m ) above MSL . Trinity Lake captures and stores water for the Central Valley Project , which provides the Central Valley with water for irrigation and produces hydroelectric power . This lake is known for its many small arms , glassy inlets , and great water-skiing conditions . After the death in office of California United States Senator Clair Engle in 1964 , the lake was renamed after him ; however , the name change never received wide popularity , especially with locals , and the name was eventually returned to its frequently known original name . The lake is serviced by three marinas : Trinity Alps Marina located on the southern end in view of the Dam ; Cedar Stock marina on the Stuart Fork arm on the west end of the lake ; and Trinity Center marina at the northern end of the main arm of the lake . Most of the marinas rent houseboats to vacationers year round . Most marinas on the lake are now owned and operated by Forever Resorts , with the only exception being the Trinity Alps Marina .

  "/wiki/Shasta_Dam": "Shasta Dam ( called Kennett Dam before its construction ) is a concrete arch-gravity dam across the Sacramento River in Northern California in the United States . At 602 feet ( 183 m ) high , it is the eighth-tallest dam in the United States . Located at the north end of the Sacramento Valley , Shasta Dam creates Shasta Lake for long-term water storage , flood control , hydroelectricity and protection against the intrusion of saline water . The largest reservoir in the state , Shasta Lake can hold about 4,500,000 acre feet ( 5,600 GL ) . Envisioned as early as 1919 as an effort to conserve , control , store , and distribute water to the Central Valley , California 's main agricultural region , Shasta was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking . However , bonds did not sell due to the onset of the Great Depression and Shasta was transferred to the federal Bureau of Reclamation as a public works project . Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer Frank Crowe . During its building , the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs ; it was finished twenty-six months ahead of schedule in 1945 . When completed , the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after Hoover , and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time . Even before its dedication , Shasta Dam served an important role in World War II providing electricity to California factories , and still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources today . However , it has greatly changed the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River , and flooded sacred Native American tribal lands . In recent years , there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and power generation , a proposal opposed by tribes and environmental experts because of negative impacts from water diversions from river flows needed by endangered fish including salmon species ."
