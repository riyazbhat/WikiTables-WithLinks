The town had a population of 39,277 in the 2011 census , making it the third largest settlement in Fife and the 18th most populous settlement in Scotland . The name Glenrothes comes from its historical link with the Earl of Rothes , who owned much of the land on which the new town has been built ; Glen ( Scottish for valley ) was added to the name to avoid confusion with Rothes in Moray and in recognition that the town lies in a river valley . The motto of Glenrothes is Ex terra vis , meaning From the earth strength , which dates back to the founding of the town . Planned in the late 1940s as one of Scotland 's first post-second world war new towns , its original purpose was to house miners who were to work at a newly established coal mine , the Rothes Colliery . After the mine closed , the town developed as an important industrial centre in Scotland 's Silicon Glen between 1961 and 2000 , with several major electronics and hi-tech companies setting up facilities in the town . The Glenrothes Development Corporation ( GDC ) , a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation , was established to develop , manage and promote the new town . The GDC , supported by the local authority , oversaw the governance of Glenrothes until the GDC was wound up in 1995 , after which all responsibility was transferred to Fife Council . Glenrothes is a major service centre and is the administrative capital of Fife , containing the headquarters of both Fife Council and Police Scotland Fife Division .
