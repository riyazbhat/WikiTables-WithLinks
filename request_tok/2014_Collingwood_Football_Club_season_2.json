  "/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions": "In the sport of Australian rules football , each of the eighteen players in a team is assigned to a particular named position on the field of play . These positions describe both the player 's main role and by implication their location on the ground . As the game has evolved , tactics and team formations have changed , and the names of the positions and the duties involved have evolved too . There are 18 positions in Australian rules football , not including four ( sometimes 6-8 ) interchange players who may replace another player on the ground at any time during play . The fluid nature of the modern game means the positions in football are not as formally defined as in sports such as rugby or American football . Even so , most players will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career , as each position requires a particular set of skills . Footballers who are able to play comfortably in numerous positions are referred to as utility players",

  "/wiki/Ruckman_(Australian_rules_football)": "In Australian rules football , a ruckman or ruckwoman is typically a tall and athletic player who contests at centre bounces and stoppages ( such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups ) . The ruckman is one of the most important players on the field . They are often key to coaching strategy and winning centre clearances which result in the most goal kicking opportunities ( inside 50s ) . The role of the ruckman in Australian rules is similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out . The key differences are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins , the ball is almost always thrown straight up high into the air rather than horizontally , so in this respect , the ruckman is similar to a basketball centre . The ruckman needs to be able to control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms . Unlike rugby , the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates . Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman . With no offside or knock on rules , the ruckman can tap the ball in any direction . Before a bounce down or ball up , ruckmen confer with the onballers ( rovers and ruck-rovers ) to pre-determine the direction of the tap so that they can position themselves to best receive it to the team 's advantage . The ruckman is typically the tallest player on either team . A typical professional Australian Football League ruckman is over 200 cm or 6 ' 7",
  "/wiki/Jordan_Russell": "Jordan Russell ( born 6 November 1986 ) is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club and the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League . Russell was recruited as the number 9 draft pick in the 2004 AFL Draft from West Adelaide . He made his AFL debut for the Carlton Football Club in Round 15 , 2005 against St Kilda , his only match for the year . He spent most of the season developing in Carlton 's VFL-affiliate , the Northern Bullants . In 2006 , he broke into the senior team , playing ten games , mostly off the bench . Russell expressed his desire to move back to South Australia for the 2007 season , with Port Adelaide seeking to trade for him , but no deal was made between the two clubs , and Russell re-signed with Carlton on 16 October 2006 to a two-year deal . In 2007 , Russell played 18 games , but had not yet stamped himself as a definite future player . Under coach Denis Pagan , he struggled for game time , and usually played completely defensive tagging roles , with reasonable success . Pagan was replaced as coach by Brett Ratten in late 2007 , and he began to play Russell in the midfield and half-forward line . He played 21 of 22 games in 2008 , and earned another two-year contract . In 2009 , Russell played 20 of 23 games , but was dropped briefly at midseason on form . This turned out to be a major turning point in Russell 's career , as his form upon return to the seniors was outstanding",

  "/wiki/Centre_half-forward": "In Australian rules football , the centre half-forward is a position on the half-forward line of a football field . The directly opposing player is a centre half-back . Wayne Carey of the North Melbourne and Adelaide football clubs is often considered to be the greatest centre half-forward of all time . The centre half-forward 's role is usually the most demanding of any player on field , with a tall frame , strength and most importantly , athleticism , required . Usually the best backman will be used to cover a quality CHF , unless the opposing full-forward is so good they take priority . Thus , an attacking team with a solid combination of both centre half-forward and full-forward will seriously stretch a defence . If a team in the AFL played without a reliable centre half-forward , then they would often struggle to win games or make an impact on the competition . Great centre half-forwards have the ability to turn games on their heads and practically win a match singlehandedly for their team . A primary skill needed is good marking ability , with long-range goalkicking also being of great value . CHFs frequently line up shots on goal from about 50 metres out , often as wide as the boundary . At AFL level especially , kicking goals on-the-run while running into the 50-metre arc is a significant and requisite skill , as well as being able to pick out markers closer to the goal square . The position is very strenuous , and players who specialise as CHFs often have unnaturally shortened careers - Dermott Brereton is a good example of a great player worn out too quickly",
