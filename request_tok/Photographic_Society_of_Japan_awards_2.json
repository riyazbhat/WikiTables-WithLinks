  "/wiki/Masatoshi_Nait\u014d": "According to Michael Hoppen Gallery , Nait\u014d was born in Tokyo in 1938 . He graduated from Waseda University in applied sciences and trained as a research scientist . A keen interest in the folkloric traditions of Japan led him to pursue a career in photography . His work on the ethnological customs of the region of T\u014dhoku became the focus of his 1970s series : Ba Ba Bakuhatsu ( Grandma Explosion ) . Early on in his career , Nait\u014d photographed the mummies of Buddhist priests who had died fasting for the salvation of starving farmers in Dewa Sanzan and then started making photographs that focused on the folk religions and ethnology of T\u014dhoku . In this body of work ( 1968-1970 ) , Nait\u014d portrays itako , female shamans who invoke the spirits of the dead . Female shamanism used to be widespread within Japan ; today it is limited to this region where the more esoteric sides of Eastern religion are still practiced . These female shamans photographed starkly by Nait\u014d are celebrating death . They mourn the dead by performing rituals and dancing all night to evoke the spirits of the deceased . These women are exuberant and celebrate death not life . Nait\u014d pays homage to this time-old tradition with his bright flash , graphically illuminating the characters he depicts . As he observed : The vitality of women comes from the earth .",
