  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

It was formed from the nationalised colonies of the Dutch East India Company , which came under the administration of the Dutch government in 1800 . During the 19th century , the Dutch possessions and hegemony were expanded , reaching their greatest territorial extent in the early 20th century . This colony was one of the most valuable colonies under the Dutch Empire 's rule , and contributed to Dutch global prominence in spice and cash crop trade in the 19th to early 20th century . The colonial social order was based on rigid racial and social structures with a Dutch elite living separate from but linked to their native subjects . The term Indonesia came into use for the geographical location after 1880 . In the early 20th century , local intellectuals began developing the concept of Indonesia as a nation state , and set the stage for an independence movement . Japan 's World War II occupation dismantled much of the Dutch colonial state and economy . Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945 , Indonesian nationalists declared independence which they fought to secure during the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution . The Netherlands formally recognized sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia at the 1949 Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference with the exception of the Netherlands New Guinea ( Western New Guinea ) , whose administration was transferred under authority of Resolution 1752 ( XVII ) to the United Nations 13 years later in 1962 ( also see New York Agreement ) .",

In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity .

The predominantly Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh was claimed by both the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and the First Republic of Armenia when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the Russian Empire , and a brief war over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out in 1920 . The dispute was largely shelved after the Soviet Union established control over the area and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( NKAO ) within the Azerbaijan SSR in 1923 . During the fall of the Soviet Union , the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan . In 1991 , a referendum held in the NKAO and the neighbouring Shahumian region resulted in a declaration of independence based on its right of self-determination . A large-scale ethnic conflict led to the 1991-1994 Nagorno-Karabakh War , which ended with a ceasefire .

However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) .

Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC .

  "/wiki/Bhutanese_enclaves": "Bhutan 's early history is steeped in mythology and remains obscure . Some of the structures provide evidence that the region has been settled as early as 2000 BC . According to a legend it was ruled by a Cooch-Behar king , Sangaldip , around the 7th century BC , but not much is known prior to the introduction of Tibetan Buddhism in the 9th century , when turmoil in Tibet forced many monks to flee to Bhutan . In the 12th century , the Drukpa Kagyupa school was established and remains the dominant form of Buddhism in Bhutan today . The country 's political history is intimately tied to its religious history and relations among the various monastic schools and monasteries . Bhutan is one of only a few countries which have been independent throughout their history , never conquered , occupied , or governed by an outside power ( notwithstanding occasional nominal tributary status ) . Although there has been speculation that it was under the Kamarupa Kingdom or the Tibetan Empire in the 7th to 9th centuries , firm evidence is lacking . From the time historical records are clear , Bhutan has continuously and successfully defended its sovereignty . The consolidation of Bhutan occurred in 1616 when Ngawanag Namgyal , a lama from western Tibet known as the Zhabdrung Rinpoche , defeated three Tibetan invasions , subjugated rival religious schools , codified the Tsa Yig , an intricate and comprehensive system of law , and established himself as ruler over a system of ecclesiastical and civil administrators . After his death , infighting and civil war eroded the power of the Zhabdrung for the next 200 years . In 1885 Ugyen Wangchuck was able to consolidate power , and began cultivating closer ties with the British in the subcontinent . In 1907 , Ugyen Wangchuck was elected as the hereditary ruler of Bhutan , crowned on December 17 , 1907 , and installed as the head of state , the Druk Gyalpo ( Dragon King ) .",

The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain , rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level . The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",

Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal lashkar ( militia ) from Waziristan , in an effort to capture Kashmir , the future of which hung in the balance . The inconclusive result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both countries . The Maharaja faced an uprising by his Muslim subjects in Poonch , and lost control of the western districts of his kingdom . On 22 October 1947 , Pakistan 's Pashtun tribal militias crossed the border of the state . These local tribal militias and irregular Pakistani forces moved to take Srinagar , but on reaching Baramulla , they took to plunder and stalled . Maharaja Hari Singh made a plea to India for assistance , and help was offered , but it was subject to his signing an Instrument of Accession to India . The war was initially fought by the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces and by tribal militias from the Frontier Tribal Areas adjoining the North-West Frontier Province . Following the accession of the state to India on 26 October 1947 , Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar , the state capital . The British commanding officers initially refused the entry of Pakistani troops into the conflict , citing the accession of the state to India . However , later in 1948 , they relented and the Pakistani armies entered the war after this .",
  "/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_war_of_1965": "The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India . The conflict began following Pakistan 's Operation Gibraltar , which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule . India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan . The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II . Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States , and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration . Much of the war was fought by the countries ' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan . This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of India in 1947 , a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001-2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan . Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units , with substantial backing from air forces , and naval operations . Many details of this war , like those of other Indo-Pakistani Wars , remain unclear . India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared . Although the two countries fought to a standoff , the conflict is seen as a strategic and political defeat for Pakistan , as it had neither succeeded in fomenting insurrection in Kashmir nor had it been able to gain meaningful support at an international level . Internationally , the war was viewed in the context of the greater Cold War , and resulted in a significant geopolitical shift in the subcontinent .",
  "/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_war_of_1971": "The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military confrontation between India and Pakistan that occurred during the liberation war in East Pakistan from 3 December 1971 to the fall of Dacca ( Dhaka ) on 16 December 1971 . The war began with preemptive aerial strikes on 11 Indian air stations , which led to the commencement of hostilities with Pakistan and Indian entry into the war of independence in East Pakistan on the side of Bengali nationalist forces . Lasting just 13 days , it is one of the shortest wars in history . During the war , Indian and Pakistani militaries simultaneously clashed on the eastern and western fronts ; the war ended after the Eastern Command of the Pakistan military signed the Instrument of Surrender on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka , marking the formation of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh . Officially , East Pakistan had earlier called for its secession from the unity of Pakistan on 26 March 1971 . Approximately 90,000 to 93,000 Pakistani servicemen were taken prisoner by the Indian Army , which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces , including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal to Pakistan . The remaining 10,324 to 12,500 prisoners were civilians , either family members of the military personnel or collaborators ( razakars ) . It is estimated that between 300,000 and 3,000,000 civilians were killed in Bangladesh . As a result of the conflict , a further eight to ten million people fled the country to seek refuge in India . During the 1971 Bangladesh war for independence , members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias called the Razakars raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape .",
  "/wiki/Simla_Agreement": "The Simla Agreement , or Shimla Agreement , was signed between India and Pakistan on 2 July 1972 in Shimla , the capital city of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh . It followed from the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1971 that led to the independence of Bangladesh , which was earlier known as East Pakistan and was part of the territory of Pakistan . India entered the war as an ally of Bangladesh which transformed the war into an Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 . The agreement was ratified by the Parliaments of both the nations in the same year . [ citation needed ] The agreement was the result of resolve of both the countries to put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations . It conceived the steps to be taken for further normalisation of mutual relations and it also laid down the principles that should govern their future relations .",
  "/wiki/Line_of_Control": "The term Line of Control ( LoC ) refers to the military control line between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir - a line which does not constitute a legally recognized international boundary , but serves as the de facto border . Originally known as the Cease-fire Line , it was redesignated as the Line of Control following the Simla Agreement , which was signed on 3 July 1972 . The part of the former princely state that is under Indian control is known as the state of Jammu and Kashmir . The Pakistani-controlled part is divided into Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan . The northernmost point of the Line of Control is known as NJ9842 . The India-Pakistan border continues from the southernmost point on the LoC . Another ceasefire line separates the Indian-controlled state of Jammu and Kashmir from the Chinese-controlled area known as Aksai Chin . Lying further to the east , it is known as the Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) . Former US President Bill Clinton has referred to the Indian subcontinent and the Kashmir Line of Control , in particular , as one of the most dangerous places in the world . [ needs update ]",
  "/wiki/India-Pakistan_relations": "Relations between India and Pakistan have been complex and largely hostile due to a number of historical and political events . Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947 , the Kashmir conflict , and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations . Consequently , their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion . Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in areas of certain demographics and shared lingua francas ( mainly Punjabi and Hindustani ) . After the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947 , two new sovereign nations were formed - the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan . The subsequent partition of the former British India displaced up to 12.5 million people , with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to 1 million . India emerged as a secular nation with a Hindu majority population and a large Muslim minority , while Pakistan with a Muslim majority population and a large Hindu minority later became an Islamic Republic although its constitution guaranteed freedom of religion to people of all faiths . It later lost most of its Hindu minority due to migration and after East Pakistan was separated in the Bangladesh Liberation War . Soon after their independence , India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations but the violent partition and numerous territorial claims would overshadow their relationship . Since their Independence , the two countries have fought three major wars , one undeclared war and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs . The Kashmir conflict is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War , which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) . There have been numerous attempts to improve the relationship - notably , the Shimla summit , the Agra summit and the Lahore summit .",
  "/wiki/Insurgency_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir": "The insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir ( also Kashmiri Insurgency , or Kashmir Intifada ) is an uprising or revolt against the Indian administration of Jammu and Kashmir , a region constituting the southern portion of the larger Kashmir region , which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947 . Jammu and Kashmir , long a breeding ground of separatist ambitions , has been wracked by the insurgency since 1989 . Although the failure of Indian governance and democracy lay at the root of the initial disaffection , Pakistan played an important role in converting the latter into a fully developed insurgency . Some insurgent groups in Kashmir support the complete independence , whereas others seek accession to Pakistan . More explicitly , the roots of the insurgency are tied to a dispute over local autonomy . Democratic development was limited in Kashmir until the late 1970s and by 1988 many of the democratic reforms provided by the Indian government had been reversed and non-violent channels for expressing discontent were limited and caused a dramatic increase in support for insurgents advocating violent secession from India . In 1987 , a disputed State election created a catalyst for the insurgency when it resulted in some of the state 's legislative assembly members forming armed insurgent groups . In July 1988 , a series of demonstrations , strikes and attacks on the Indian government began the Kashmir insurgency , which during the 1990s escalated into the most important internal security issue in India . Pakistan claims to be giving its moral and diplomatic support to the separatist movement . The Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan has been accused by India and the international community of supporting , supplying arms and training mujahideen , to fight in Jammu and Kashmir . In 2015 , former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf admitted that Pakistan had supported and trained insurgent groups in the 1990s . India has repeatedly called Pakistan to end its cross-border terrorism in Kashmir .",
  "/wiki/Pakistan_and_state_sponsored_terrorism": "Pakistan has been accused by neighbouring countries India , Afghanistan and Iran and other nations , including and other nations such as the United States , the United Kingdom , and France , of involvement in terrorist activities in the region and beyond . Pakistan 's tribal region along its border with Afghanistan has been described as a safe haven for terrorists by western media and the United States Defense Secretary . According to an analysis published by the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution in 2008 , Pakistan was , with the possible exception of Iran , perhaps the world 's most active sponsor of terrorist groups . aiding these groups that pose a direct threat to the United States . Pakistan 's active participation has caused thousands of deaths in the region ; all these years Pakistan has been supportive to several terrorist groups despite several stern warnings from the international community . Daniel Byman , an author , also wrote that , Pakistan is probably 2008 's most active sponsor of terrorism . In 2018 , former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif suggested that the Pakistani government played a role in the 2008 Mumbai attack . In July 2019 , reigning Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on his official visit to the United States claimed the presence of 30000-40000 armed terrorists in the country . He further stated that previous governments were hiding this truth particularly from the US in the last 15 years . The U.S. Country Reports on Terrorism describes Pakistan as a Terrorist safe haven where terrorists are able to organize , plan , raise funds , communicate , recruit , train , transit , and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity , political will , or both .",

  "/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice": "The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , sometimes called the World Court , is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations ( UN ) . The ICJ settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues referred to it by the UN . Through its opinions and rulings , it serves as a source of international law . The ICJ is the successor of the Permanent Court of International Justice ( PCIJ ) , which was established by the League of Nations in 1920 . After the Second World War , both the League and the PCIJ were succeeded by the United Nations and ICJ , respectively . The Statute of the ICJ draws heavily from that of its predecessor , and the latter 's decisions remain valid . All members of the UN are party to the ICJ Statute . The ICJ comprises a panel of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly and Security Council for nine-year terms . The court is seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague , Netherlands , making it the only principal U.N. organ not located in New York City . Its official working languages are English and French .",
  "/wiki/Fergana_Valley": "The Fergana Valley is a valley in Central Asia spread across eastern Uzbekistan , southern Kyrgyzstan and northern Tajikistan . Divided into three republics of the former Soviet Union , the valley is ethnically diverse and in the early 21st century was the scene of ethnic conflict . A large triangular valley in what is an often dry part of Central Asia , the Fergana owes its fertility to two rivers , the Naryn and the Kara Darya , which run from the east , joining near Namangan , forming the Syr Darya river . The valley 's history stretches back over 2,300 years , when its population was conquered by Greco-Bactrian invaders from the west . Chinese chroniclers date its towns to more than 2,100 years ago , as a path between Greek , Chinese , Bactrian and Parthian civilisations . It was home to Babur , founder of the Mughal Dynasty , tying the region to modern Afghanistan and South Asia . The Russian Empire conquered the valley at the end of the 19th century , and it became part of the Soviet Union in the 1920s . Its three Soviet republics gained independence in 1991 . The area largely remains Muslim , populated by ethnic Uzbek , Tajik and Kyrgyz people , often intermixed and not matching modern borders . Historically there have also been substantial numbers of Russian , Kashgarians , Kipchaks , Bukharan Jews and Romani minorities . Mass cotton cultivation , introduced by the Soviets , remains central to the economy , along with a wide range of grains , fruits and vegetables . There is a long history of stock breeding , leatherwork and a growing mining sector , including deposits of coal , iron , sulfur , gypsum , rock-salt , naphtha and some small known oil reserves .",

It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south , Uzbekistan to the west , Kyrgyzstan to the north , and China to the east . The traditional homelands of the Tajik people include present-day Tajikistan as well as parts of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan . The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the city of Sarazm of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including the Oxus civilisation , Andronovo culture , Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , Manichaeism and Islam . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Achaemenid Empire , Sasanian Empire , Hephthalite Empire , Samanid Empire , Mongol Empire , Timurid dynasty , the Khanate of Bukhara , the Russian Empire , and subsequently the Soviet Union . Within the Soviet Union , the country 's modern borders were drawn when it was part of Uzbekistan as an autonomous republic before becoming a full-fledged Soviet republic in 1929 . On 9 September 1991 , Tajikistan became an independent sovereign nation when the Soviet Union disintegrated . A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence , lasting from 1992 to 1997 . Since the end of the war , newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country 's economy to grow . Like all other Central Asian neighbouring states , the country , led by President Emomali Rahmon since 1994 , has been criticised by a number of non-governmental organizations for authoritarian leadership , lack of religious freedom , corruption and widespread violations of human rights .

The region defined as the Golan Heights differs between disciplines : as a geological and biogeographical region , the Golan Heights is a basaltic plateau bordered by the Yarmouk River in the south , the Sea of Galilee and Hula Valley in the west , the Anti-Lebanon with Mount Hermon in the north and Wadi Raqqad in the east ; and as a geopolitical region , the Golan Heights is the area captured from Syria and occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War , territory which has been administered as part of Israel since 1981 . This region includes the western two-thirds of the geological Golan Heights and the Israeli-occupied part of Mount Hermon . The earliest evidence of human habitation on the Golan dates to the Upper Paleolithic period . According to the Bible , an Amorite Kingdom in Bashan was conquered by Israelites during the reign of King Og . Throughout the biblical period , the Golan was the focus of a power struggle between the kings of Israel and the Aramaeans who were based near modern-day Damascus . After Assyrian and Babylonian rule , Persia dominated the region and allowed it to be resettled by returning Jews from the Babylonian Captivity . The Itureans , an Arab or Aramaic people , settled there in the 2nd century BCE and remained until the end of the Byzantine period . Gamla , the capital of Jewish Galaunitis , would play a major role in the Jewish-Roman wars , and came to house the earliest known urban synagogue from the Hasmonean/Herodian realm . Organized Jewish settlement in the region came to an end in 636 CE when it was conquered by Arabs under Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b . In the 16th century , the Golan was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and was part of the Vilayet of Damascus until it was transferred to French mandate in 1918 . When the mandate terminated in 1946 , it became part of the newly independent Syrian Republic .",

It served as the de facto borders of the State of Israel from 1949 until the Six-Day War in 1967 . The name comes from the green ink used to draw the line on the map while the armistice talks were going on . After the Six-Day War , the territories captured by Israel beyond the Green Line came to be designated as East Jerusalem , the West Bank , Gaza Strip , Golan Heights , and Sinai Peninsula ( the Sinai Peninsula has since been returned to Egypt as part of the 1979 peace treaty ) . These territories are often referred to as Israeli-occupied territories . The Green Line was intended as a demarcation line rather than a permanent border . The 1949 Armistice Agreements were clear ( at Arab insistence ) that they were not creating permanent borders . The Egyptian-Israeli agreement , for example , stated that the Armistice Demarcation Line is not to be construed in any sense as a political or territorial boundary , and is delineated without prejudice to rights , claims and positions of either Party to the Armistice as regards ultimate settlement of the Palestine question . Similar provisions are contained in the Armistice Agreements with Jordan and Syria . The Agreement with Lebanon contained no such provisions , and was treated as the international border between Israel and Lebanon , stipulating only that forces would be withdrawn to the Israel-Lebanon border .

Palestine has a population of 5,051,953 as of February 2020 , ranked 121st in the world . After World War II , in 1947 , the UN adopted a Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationalized Jerusalem . After the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 , neighboring Arab armies invaded the former British mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces . Later , the All-Palestine Government was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 to govern the Egyptian-controlled enclave in Gaza . It was soon recognized by all Arab League members except Transjordan . Though jurisdiction of the Government was declared to cover the whole of the former Mandatory Palestine , its effective jurisdiction was limited to the Gaza Strip . Israel later captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt , the West Bank ( including East Jerusalem ) from Jordan , and the Golan Heights from Syria in June 1967 following the Six-Day War .

Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , with only partial success , as at the end of 2019 . The origins to the conflict can be traced back to Jewish immigration and sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine between Jews and Arabs . It has been referred to as the world 's most intractable conflict , with the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip reaching 53 years . Despite a long-term peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan , Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement . The key issues are mutual recognition and security , borders , water rights , control of Jerusalem , Israeli settlements , Palestinian freedom of movement , and Palestinian right of return . The violence of the conflict , in a region rich in sites of historic , cultural and religious interest worldwide , has been the subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights , security issues and human rights , and has been a factor hampering tourism in and general access to areas that are hotly contested . Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution , involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel ( after Israel 's establishment in 1948 ) . In 2007 , the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians , according to a number of polls , preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict . Within Israeli and Palestinian society , the conflict generates a wide variety of views and opinions .

The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore . The West Bank was the name given to the territory that was captured by Jordan in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War , and subsequently annexed in 1950 until 1967 when it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War . The Oslo Accords , signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel , created administrative districts with varying levels of Palestinian autonomy within each area . Area C , in which Israel maintained complete civil and security control , accounts for over 60 % of the territory of the West Bank . The West Bank , including East Jerusalem , has a land area of 5,640 km2 plus a water area of 220 km2 , consisting of the northwest quarter of the Dead Sea . As of July 2017 [ update ] it has an estimated population of 2,747,943 Palestinians , and approximately 391,000 Israeli settlers , and approximately another 201,200 Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this . The International Court of Justice advisory ruling ( 2004 ) concluded that events that came after the 1967 occupation of the West Bank by Israel , including the Jerusalem Law , Israel 's peace treaty with Jordan and the Oslo Accords , did not change the status of the West Bank ( including East Jerusalem ) as occupied territory with Israel as the occupying power ."
