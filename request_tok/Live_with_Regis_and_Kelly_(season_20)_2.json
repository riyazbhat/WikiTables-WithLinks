  "/wiki/Boyz_II_Men": "Boyz II Men ( pronounced boys to men ) is an American R & B and hip hop vocal group from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies . They are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman . During the 1990s , Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet including bass Michael McCary , who left the group in 2003 due to multiple sclerosis . During the 1990s , Boyz II Men gained international success . This began with the release of top 5 singles Motownphilly and It 's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday in 1991 , followed by the number one single End of the Road in 1992 , which reached the top of charts worldwide . End of the Road set a new record for longevity , staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks , breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley . Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of I 'll Make Love to You and One Sweet Day ( with Mariah Carey ) , which , at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively , each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one . I 'll Make Love to You also topped the charts in Australia ( for four weeks ) and garnered international success . Consequently , Boyz II Men is among the music industry 's elite with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history with 50 cumulative weeks , ranking fourth behind Presley , The Beatles , and Carey . Furthermore , when On Bended Knee took the number one spot away from I 'll Make Love to You , Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever ( after The Beatles and Presley ) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 . These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine 's biggest boy band during the period of 1987 to 2012 . Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide , as a trio .",

The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 .

The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on .
