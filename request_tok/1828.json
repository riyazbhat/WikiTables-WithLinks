  "/wiki/King_Arthur": "King Arthur was a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . The details of Arthur 's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical . The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources , including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur 's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work , Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore , sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn . How much of Geoffrey 's Historia ( completed in 1138 ) was adapted from such earlier sources , rather than invented by Geoffrey himself , is unknown . Although the themes , events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text , and there is no one canonical version , Geoffrey 's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories . Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey 's Historia , including Arthur 's father Uther Pendragon , the magician Merlin , Arthur 's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur 's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon . The 12th-century French writer Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes , who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story , began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature .",
