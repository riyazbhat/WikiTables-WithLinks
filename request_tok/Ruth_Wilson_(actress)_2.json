  "/wiki/King_Lear": "King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare . It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters , after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner . His third daughter gets nothing , because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done . When he feels disrespected by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power , he becomes furious to the point of madness . He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter , just before tragedy strikes her and then the king . Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain , a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king , the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures , with the title role coveted by many of the world 's most accomplished actors . The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play , originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. Stephen 's Day in 1606 , was a 1608 publication in a quarto of uncertain provenance , in which the play is listed as a history ; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text . The Tragedy of King Lear , a revised version that is better tailored for performance , was included in the 1623 First Folio . Modern editors usually conflate the two , though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved . After the English Restoration , the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone , but since the 19th century Shakespeare 's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements . The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship . George Bernard Shaw wrote No man will ever write a better tragedy than Lear .",
