  "/wiki/Honda_Civic": "The Honda Civic ( Japanese : \u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30af ) is a line of cars manufactured by Honda . Originally a subcompact , the Civic has gone through several generational changes , becoming both larger and more upscale , moving into the compact car segment . EPA guidelines for vehicle size class stipulate a car having combined passenger and cargo room of 110 to 119.9 cubic feet ( 3,110 to 3,400 L ) is considered a mid-size car , and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small-end mid-size car , although it still competes in the compact class . The Civic coup\u00e9 is still considered a compact car . The Civic currently falls between the Honda City and Honda Accord . The first generation Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door model , followed by a three-door hatchback that September . With an 1169 cc transverse engine and front-wheel drive like the British Mini , the car provided good interior space despite overall small dimensions . Initially gaining a reputation for being fuel-efficient , reliable and environmentally friendly , later iterations have become known for performance and sportiness , especially the Civic Type R , Civic VTi , Civic GTi and Civic SiR/Si . The Civic has been repeatedly rebadged for international markets , and served as the basis for the Honda CR-X , the Honda CR-X del Sol , the Concerto , the first generation Prelude , the Civic Shuttle ( later to become the Orthia ) and the CR-V . In Japan , as customers increasingly shifted to minivans and compact cars like the Fit , production of the non-hybrid Civic ended in August 2010 when it no longer complied with Japanese government dimension regulations in the width category . However , the Civic was reintroduced into the Japanese market with the launch of the tenth generation model in 2017 .",
