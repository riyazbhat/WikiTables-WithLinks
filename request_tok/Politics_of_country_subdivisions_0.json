  "/wiki/Capital_(political)": "A capital or capital city is the municipality exercising primary status in a country , state , province , or other administrative region , usually as its seat of government . A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government 's offices and meeting places ; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution . In some jurisdictions , including several countries , the different branches of government are located in different settlements . In some cases , a distinction is made between the official ( constitutional ) capital and the seat of government , which is in another place . Capital cities that also serve as the prime economic , population , cultural , or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as primate cities . Examples are Athens , Bangkok , Brussels , Copenhagen , Cairo , London , Mexico City , Paris , Lima , Seoul and Tokyo . News media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there , as a form of metonymy . For example , relations between Washington and London refer to relations between the United States and the United Kingdom",
  "/wiki/Area": "Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape or planar lamina , in the plane . Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object . Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape , or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat . It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve ( a one-dimensional concept ) or the volume of a solid ( a three-dimensional concept ) . The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size . In the International System of Units ( SI ) , the standard unit of area is the square metre ( written as m2 ) , which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long . A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares . In mathematics , the unit square is defined to have area one , and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number . There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles , rectangles , and circles . Using these formulas , the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles . For shapes with curved boundary , calculus is usually required to compute the area . Indeed , the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus",
  "/wiki/Population": "In biology a population is all the organisms of the same group or species , which live in a particular geographical area . The area of a sexual population is the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area , and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas . In sociology , population refers to a collection of humans and their entire race . Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations . Population , in a more simple term , is the number of people in a city or town , region , country or world ; population is usually determined by a process called census ( a process of collecting , analyzing , compiling and publishing data )",

Geographically , Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area in the west , which includes the Gran Sasso d'Italia , and a coastal area in the east with beaches on the Adriatic Sea . Abruzzo is considered a region of Southern Italy in terms of its culture , language , history and economy , although geographically it may also be considered central . The Italian Statistical Authority ( ISTAT ) also deems it to be part of Southern Italy , partly because of Abruzzo 's historic association with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . Abruzzo is known as the greenest region in Europe as almost half of its territory , the largest in Europe , is set aside as national parks and protected nature reserves . There are three national parks , one regional park , and 38 protected nature reserves . These ensure the survival of 75 % of Europe 's living species , including rare species such as the golden eagle , the Abruzzo ( or Abruzzese ) chamois , the Apennine wolf and the Marsican brown bear . Abruzzo is also home to Calderone , Europe 's southernmost glacier .

The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city .

After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates .
