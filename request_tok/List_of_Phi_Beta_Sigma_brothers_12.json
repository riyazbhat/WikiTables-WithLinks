In 2004 , the Suns reacquired Steve Nash , and immediately returned into playoff contention .

The winners of the Finals are awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy , which replaced the Walter A . Brown Trophy in 1983 . The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949-50 season when the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) merged with the National Basketball League ( NBL ) to form the NBA . The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985 , as well as a brief stint as the Showdown , before settling on NBA Finals in 1986 . Since 2018 , it has been officially known as the NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV for sponsorship reasons . The NBA Finals was initially structured in a 2-2-1-1-1 format . In 1985 , to ease the amount of cross-country travel , it was changed to a 2-3-2 format , where the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season . In 2014 , the 2-2-1-1-1 format was restored . The first two games are played the higher-seeded team 's home , the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team , and the remaining three are played at each team 's home arena alternately . A total of 19 franchises have won the NBA Finals , with the Toronto Raptors winning in 2019 .",
