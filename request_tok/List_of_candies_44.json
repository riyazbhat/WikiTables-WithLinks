  "/wiki/Butterscotch": "Butterscotch is a type of confectionery whose primary ingredients are brown sugar and butter , but other ingredients are part of some recipes , such as corn syrup , cream , vanilla , and salt . The earliest known recipes , in mid-19th century Yorkshire , used treacle ( molasses ) in place of or in addition to sugar . Butterscotch is similar to toffee , but for butterscotch , the sugar is boiled to the soft crack stage , not hard crack as with toffee . Often credited with their invention , Parkinson 's of Doncaster made butterscotch boiled sweets and sold them in tins , which became one of the town 's best known exports . They became famous in 1851 when Queen Victoria was presented with a tin when she visited the town . Butterscotch sauce , made of butterscotch and cream , is used as a topping for ice cream ( particularly sundaes ) . The term butterscotch is also often used more specifically of the flavour of brown sugar and butter together even if the actual confection butterscotch is not involved , such as in butterscotch pudding ( a type of custard ) .",
  "/wiki/Brown_sugar": "Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses . It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content ( natural brown sugar ) , or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar ( commercial brown sugar ) . The Codex Alimentarius requires brown sugar to contain at least 88% of sucrose plus invert sugar . Commercial brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses ( light brown sugar ) to 6.5% molasses ( dark brown sugar ) based on total volume . Based on total weight , regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses . The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic nature of the molasses and is often labelled as soft . The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling . The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products . Particle size is variable but generally less than granulated white sugar . Products for industrial use ( e.g. , the industrial production of cakes ) may be based on caster sugar which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm .",
  "/wiki/Butter": "Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of milk or cream . It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature , consisting of approximately 80% butterfat . It is used at room temperature as a spread , melted as a condiment , and used as an ingredient in baking , sauce making , pan frying , and other cooking procedures . Most frequently made from cow 's milk , butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals , including sheep , goats , buffalo , and yaks . It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk . Salt and food colorings are sometimes added to butter . Rendering butter , removing the water and milk solids , produces clarified butter or ghee , which is almost entirely butterfat . Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream , where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers . Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated , but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature , and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 \u00b0C ( 90 to 95 \u00b0F ) . The density of butter is 911 grams per litre ( 0.950 lb per US pint ) . It generally has a pale yellow color , but varies from deep yellow to nearly white . Its natural , unmodified color is dependent on the source animal 's feed and genetics , but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto or carotene .",
  "/wiki/Corn_syrup": "Corn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn ( called maize in some countries ) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides , depending on the grade . Corn syrup , also known as glucose syrup to confectioners , is used in foods to soften texture , add volume , prevent crystallization of sugar , and enhance flavor . Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) , which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase , thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose . The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup , since glucose syrup in the United States is most commonly made from corn starch . Technically , glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono- , di- , and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch ; wheat , tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources .",
  "/wiki/Cream": "Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization . In un-homogenized milk , the fat , which is less dense , eventually rises to the top . In the industrial production of cream , this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators . In many countries , it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content . It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets , and contains high levels of saturated fat . Cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey , a by-product of cheese-making . Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty , tangy and cheesy . In many countries , cream is usually sold partially fermented : sour cream , cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche , and so on . Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet , bitter , salty and tangy dishes . Cream produced by cattle ( particularly Jersey cattle ) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat ; this gives it a slightly yellow tone , hence the name of the yellowish-white color : cream . This is also the origin of butter 's yellow color . Cream from goat 's milk , or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets , is white .",
  "/wiki/Vanilla": "Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla , primarily from the Mexican species , flat-leaved vanilla ( V. planifolia ) . The word vanilla , derived from vainilla , the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina ( vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod ) , is translated simply as little pod . Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid , called tl\u012blxochitl by the Aztecs . Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s . Pollination is required to get the vanilla fruit from which the flavoring is derived . In 1837 , Belgian botanist Charles Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant . The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially . In 1841 , Edmond Albius , a slave who lived on the French island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean , discovered at the age of 12 that the plant could be hand-pollinated . Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant . Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally , all of which derive from a species originally found in Mesoamerica , including parts of modern-day Mexico . They are V. planifolia ( syn . V. fragrans ) , grown on Madagascar , R\u00e9union , and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean ; V. tahitensis , grown in the South Pacific ; and V. pompona , found in the West Indies , Central America , and South America .",
  "/wiki/Salt": "Salt is a mineral consisting primarily of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts ; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite . Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater , where it is the main mineral constituent . The open ocean has about 35 grams ( 1.2 oz ) of solids per liter of sea water , a salinity of 3.5% . Salt is essential for life in general , and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes . Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings , and salting is an important method of food preservation . Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC , when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts ; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period . Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Hittites , Egyptians , and the Indians . Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea , along specially built salt roads , and across the Sahara on camel caravans . The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues . Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance . Salt is processed from salt mines , and by the evaporation of seawater ( sea salt ) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools . Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine ; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride , plastics , paper pulp and many other products .",
  "/wiki/Candy_Buttons": "Candy Buttons , Candy Dots , or Pox are small rounded pegs of candy that are attached to a strip of paper . This classic sugar candy was originally introduced by the Cumberland Valley company and J Sudak and Son of Williamsburg , Brooklyn . In 1977 , Sudak , which changed its name to Uncle Nibbles Candy Factory , sold to a repackager in Manhattan named CeeDee Candy , they sold to NECCO . After that acquisition , Necco bought the Cumberland Valley Company in 1980 , which made them the exclusive manufacturer of this product in the United States . Each strip of the candy includes three flavors : cherry ( pink ) , lime ( blue ) , and lemon ( yellow ) . Candy Buttons come in two strip sizes : long and short . The long is 22\u00bd inches , while the short is 11\u00bc inches . NECCO made 750 million candy buttons in the course of a year . Following NECCO 's 2018 bankruptcy , Candy Buttons were bought at auction by Cincinnati 's Doscher 's Candies . They were subsequently the first former Necco candy back to market .

  "/wiki/Christmas_tree": "A Christmas tree is a decorated tree , usually an evergreen conifer , such as a spruce , pine or fir , or an artificial tree of similar appearance , associated with the celebration of Christmas , hence its name , originating in Northern Europe . The custom was developed in medieval Livonia ( present-day Estonia and Latvia ) , and in early modern Germany where Protestant Germans brought decorated trees into their homes . It acquired popularity beyond the Lutheran areas of Germany and the Baltic countries during the second half of the 19th century , at first among the upper classes . The Catholic Church had long resisted this Protestant custom and the Christmas Tree stood for the first time in Vatican in 1982 . The tree was traditionally decorated with roses made of colored paper , apples , wafers , tinsel , [ and ] sweetmeats . In the 18th century , it began to be illuminated by candles , which were ultimately replaced by Christmas lights after the advent of electrification . Today , there is a wide variety of traditional and modern ornaments , such as garlands , baubles , tinsel , and candy canes . An angel or star might be placed at the top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem , respectively , from the Nativity . Edible items such as gingerbread , chocolate and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from the tree 's branches with ribbons . In the Western Christian tradition , Christmas trees are variously erected on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve depending on the country ; customs of the same faith hold that the two traditional days when Christmas decorations , such as the Christmas tree , are removed are Twelfth Night and , if they are not taken down on that day , Candlemas , the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations . The Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the Yule-tree , especially in discussions of its folkloric origins .",

Instead of using cardboard rolls , which were not very successful , Noble created tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh . Noble founded the Life Savers and Candy Company in 1913 and significantly expanded the market for the product by installing Life Savers displays next to the cash registers of restaurants and grocery stores . He also encouraged the owners of the establishments to always give customers a nickel in their change to encourage sales of the 5\u00a2 Life Savers . The slogan Still only 5 cents helped Life Savers to become a favorite treat for children with a tight allowance . Since then , many different flavors of Life Savers have been produced .

The sugar is often colored to appear festive , and the candy often has a glossy sheen . It is commonly made with extracts , often of different mint or citrus flavors . It is usually thin enough to melt quickly in the mouth , but because pieces of it are usually larger than bite size , biting into a stick of it causes shattering and shards . Many types of ribbon candies also tend to become sticky easily , usually either due to body warmth from being held , or simply from room temperature and humidity .

Recipes for hard candy may use syrups of sucrose , glucose , fructose or other sugars . Sugar-free versions have also been created . Once the syrup blend reaches the target temperature , the candy maker removes it from the heat source and may add citric acid , food dye , and some flavouring , such as a plant extract , essential oil , or flavourant . The syrup concoction , which is now very thick , can be poured into a mold or tray to cool , or a cooling table in case of industrial mass production . When the syrup is cool enough to handle , it can be folded , rolled , or molded into the shapes desired . After the boiled syrup cools , it is called hard candy , since it becomes stiff and brittle as it approaches room temperature .",

Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists , indigenous peoples , African slaves and their descendants . Owing to Europe 's colonization of the Americas , most North Americans speak European languages such as English , Spanish or French , and their states ' cultures commonly reflect Western traditions .",
  "/wiki/Christmas_holiday_season": "The Christmas season , also called the holiday season ( often simply called the holidays ) , or the festive season , is an annually recurring period recognized in many Western and other countries that is generally considered to run from late November to early January . It is defined as incorporating at least Christmas , usually New Year , and sometimes various other holidays and festivals . It also is associated with a period of shopping which comprises a peak season for the retail sector ( the Christmas ( or holiday ) shopping season ) and a period of sales at the end of the season ( the January sales ) . Christmas window displays and Christmas tree lighting ceremonies when trees decorated with ornaments and light bulbs are illuminated are traditions in many areas . In the denominations of Western Christianity , the term Christmas season is considered synonymous with Christmastide , which runs from December 25 ( Christmas Day ) to January 5 ( Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve ) , popularly known as the 12 Days of Christmas . However , as the economic impact involving the anticipatory lead-up to Christmas Day grew in America and Europe into the 19th and 20th centuries , the term Christmas season began to become synonymous instead with the traditional Christian Advent season , the period observed in Western Christianity from the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day until Christmas Day itself . The term Advent calendar continues to be widely known in Western parlance as a term referring to a countdown to Christmas Day from the beginning of December . Beginning in the mid-20th century , as the Christian-associated Christmas holiday and liturgical season , in some circles , became increasingly commercialized and central to American economics and culture while religio-multicultural sensitivity rose , generic references to the season that omitted the word Christmas became more common in the corporate and public sphere of the United States , which has caused a semantics controversy that continues to the present . By the late 20th century , the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and the new African American cultural holiday of Kwanzaa began to be considered in the U.S. as being part of the holiday season , a term that as of 2013 has become equally or more prevalent than Christmas season in U.S. sources to refer to the end-of-the-year festive period . Holiday season has also spread in varying degrees to Canada ; however , in the United Kingdom and Ireland , the phrase holiday season is not widely synonymous with the Christmas-New Year period , and is often instead associated with summer holidays .",
  "/wiki/Rock_(confectionery)": "Rock ( often known by its place of origin , for instance Blackpool rock or Brighton rock ) is a type of hard stick-shaped boiled sugar confectionery most usually flavoured with peppermint or spearmint . It is commonly sold at tourist ( usually seaside ) resorts in the United Kingdom ( such as Brighton , Southend-on-Sea , Scarborough or Blackpool ) and Ireland ( e.g . Bray and Strandhill ) ; in Gibraltar ; in Denmark in towns such as L\u00f8kken and Ebeltoft ; and in Sydney and Tasmania , Australia .

Blackpool rock is usually at least 2.5 cm ( 0.98 in ) in diameter , and can be as thick as 17 cm ( 6.7 in ) across and up to 2 m ( 6.6 ft ) long when made for special retail displays . These cylinders usually have a pattern embedded throughout the length , which is often the name of the resort where the rock is sold , so that the name can be read on both ends of the stick ( reversed at one end ) and remains legible even after pieces are bitten off . Rock is also manufactured as a promotional item , for example with a company name running through it . It is sometimes found in the form of individual sweets , with writing or a pattern in the centre ; these are , in effect , slices of rock .",
