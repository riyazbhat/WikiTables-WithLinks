He attended Louisiana State University ( LSU ) , where he played college football as a halfback , return specialist , and defensive back for the LSU Tigers . At LSU , Cannon was twice unanimously named an All-American , helped the 1958 LSU team win a national championship , and received the Heisman Trophy as the nation 's most outstanding college player in 1959 . His punt return against Ole Miss on Halloween night in 1959 is considered by fans and sportswriters to be one of the most famous plays in LSU sports history . Cannon was selected as the first overall pick in the 1960 NFL Draft and as a first-round territorial pick in the 1960 American Football League draft , resulting in a contract dispute that ended in court . Cannon played in the AFL for the Houston Oilers and Oakland Raiders before ending his football career with the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL . He began his professional career as a halfback for the Oilers . A two-time AFL All-Star , Cannon led the league in rushing and all-purpose yards in 1961 . He was named the most valuable player of the first two AFL championship games , which were won by the Oilers . He was moved to fullback and later tight end after being traded to the Raiders , with whom he won another league championship in 1967 . That season , he played in the second AFL-NFL World Championship game , retroactively known as Super Bowl II , in which his team was defeated by the Green Bay Packers . Cannon became a dentist after retiring from football .",
  "/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)": "A halfback ( HB ) is an offensive position in American football , whose duties involve lining up in the backfield and carrying the ball on most rushing plays , i.e . a running back . When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield , and especially when that player is placed behind another player ( usually a blocking back ) , as in the I formation , that player is instead referred to as a tailback ( see History below ) . The halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field , and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team 's success . Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an eligible receiver . Occasionally , they line up as additional wide receivers . When not running or catching the ball , the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking , either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football .",

Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks .
