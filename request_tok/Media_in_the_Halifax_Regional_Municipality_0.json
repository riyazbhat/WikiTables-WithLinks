  "/wiki/Campus_radio": "Campus radio ( also known as college radio , university radio or student radio ) is a type of radio station that is run by the students of a college , university or other educational institution . Programming may be exclusively by students , or may include programmers from the wider community in which the radio station is based . Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters . Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only . Some radio stations are distributed through the cable television system on cable FM or the second audio program of a TV radio station .",

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format . Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report . As of December 2019 there are now over 1,100 classic hits stations in the United States , the largest amount in format history .",

  "/wiki/Public_broadcasting": "Public broadcasting involves radio , television and other electronic-media outlets whose primary mission is public service . In many countries of the world , funding comes from governments , especially via annual fees charged on receivers . In the United States , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ( ranging from small shops to corporations ) , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages . Historically , public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) . Commercial broadcasting now also exists in most of these countries ; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century .

Common topics for news reports include war , government , politics , education , health , the environment , economy , business , fashion , and entertainment , as well as athletic events , quirky or unusual events . Government proclamations , concerning royal ceremonies , laws , taxes , public health , and criminals , have been dubbed news since ancient times .

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",

The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake . The format became especially popular in the mid-sixties as radio stations constrained disc jockeys to numbered play lists in the wake of the payola scandal .",

  "/wiki/Country_music": "Country music , also known as country and western ( or simply country ) , and hillbilly music , is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as American folk music ( especially Appalachian and Western music ) and blues . Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",

  "/wiki/Soft_adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",
