As a symbol of the U.S. military , the phrase The Pentagon is also often used as a metonym for the Department of Defense and its leadership . Located in Arlington County , Virginia , across the Potomac River from Washington , D.C. , the building was designed by American architect George Bergstrom and built by contractor John McShain . Ground was broken on September 11 , 1941 , and the building was dedicated on January 15 , 1943 . General Brehon Somervell provided the major motivating power behind the project ; Colonel Leslie Groves was responsible for overseeing the project for the U.S. Army . The Pentagon is the world 's largest office building , with about 6,500,000 sq ft ( 600,000 m2 ) of space , of which 3,700,000 sq ft ( 340,000 m2 ) are used as offices . Some 23,000 military and civilian employees , and another 3,000 non-defense support personnel , work in the Pentagon . It has five sides , five floors above ground , two basement levels , and five ring corridors per floor with a total of 17.5 mi ( 28.2 km ) of corridors . The central five-acre ( 20,000 m2 ) pentagonal plaza is nicknamed ground zero on the presumption that it would be a prime target in a nuclear war . On September 11 , 2001 , exactly 60 years after the building 's construction began , American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked and flown into the western side of the building , killing 189 people ( 59 victims and the five perpetrators on board the airliner , as well as 125 victims in the building ) , according to the 9/11 Commission Report .

  "/wiki/National_Security_Agency": "The National Security Agency ( NSA ) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense , under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence . The NSA is responsible for global monitoring , collection , and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes , specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) . The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems . The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission , the majority of which are clandestine . Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II , it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 . Since then , it has become the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget . The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end . The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet , which severely damaged Iran 's nuclear program . The NSA , alongside the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe ; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service ( a highly classified intelligence team ) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets ( such as Presidential palaces or embassies ) . SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass close surveillance , burglary , wiretapping , [ and ] breaking and entering . Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage , the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering . The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to , and the coordination of , SIGINT elements for other government organizations - which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own .",
  "/wiki/Military_intelligence": "Military intelligence is a military discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to assist commanders in their decisions . This aim is achieved by providing an assessment of data from a range of sources , directed towards the commanders ' mission requirements or responding to questions as part of operational or campaign planning . To provide an analysis , the commander 's information requirements are first identified , which are then incorporated into intelligence collection , analysis , and dissemination . Areas of study may include the operational environment , hostile , friendly and neutral forces , the civilian population in an area of combat operations , and other broader areas of interest . Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels , from tactical to strategic , in peacetime , the period of transition to war , and during a war itself . Most governments maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services . The military and civilian intelligence capabilities collaborate to inform the spectrum of political and military activities . Personnel performing intelligence duties may be selected for their analytical abilities and personal intelligence before receiving formal training .",
  "/wiki/Invasion_of_Iraq": "The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War . The invasion phase began on 19 March 2003 and lasted just over one month , including 26 days of major combat operations , in which a combined force of troops from the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia and Poland invaded Iraq . This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the End of major combat operations , after which the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005 . U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011 . The U.S.-led coalition sent 177,194 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase , which lasted from 19 March to 1 May 2003 . About 130,000 arrived from the U.S. alone , with about 45,000 British soldiers , 2,000 Australian soldiers , and 194 Polish soldiers . 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath . In preparation for the invasion , 100,000 U.S. troops assembled in Kuwait by 18 February . The coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan . According to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , the coalition aimed to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , to end Saddam Hussein 's support for terrorism , and to free the Iraqi people . Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the September 11 attacks , on the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations , and the rise of the freedom agenda . According to Blair , the trigger was Iraq 's failure to take a final opportunity to disarm itself of alleged nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace .",

These are used in emergency , acute , and psychiatric settings to control unruly patients who are interfering with their care or who are otherwise harmful to themselves or others in their vicinity . Chemical restraints are also referred to as a Psychopharmacologic Agent , Psychotropic Drug or Therapeutic Restraints in certain legal writing . Drugs that are often used as chemical restraints include benzodiazepines , antipsychotics , and dissociative anesthetics . In the United States , no drugs are presently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for use as chemical restraints . According to the Nursing Home Reform Act , individuals have the right to be free from physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the residents medical symptoms . However , they are still used , and the FDA estimates 15,000 elderly individuals die each year by use of unnecessary anti-psychotics in nursing homes . The use of chemical restraint has been criticized . It has been found to be mismanaged by health care workers for the convenience of the staff rather than the benefit of the patient , as workers use them to prevent patients from resisting care rather than improving the health of the patient .

  "/wiki/Fossil_fuel": "A fossil fuel is a fuel formed by natural processes , such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms , containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis . Such organisms and their resulting fossil fuels typically have an age of millions of years , and sometimes more than 650 million years . Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum , coal , and natural gas . Commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane . Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon-to-hydrogen ratios ( like methane ) , to liquids ( like petroleum ) , to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon , like anthracite coal . Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields either alone , associated with oil , or in the form of methane clathrates . As of 2018 , the world 's primary energy sources consisted of petroleum ( 34% ) , coal ( 27% ) , natural gas ( 24% ) , amounting to an 85% share for fossil fuels in primary energy-consumption in the world . Non-fossil sources included nuclear ( 4.4% ) , hydroelectric ( 6.8% ) , and other renewables ( 4.0% , including geothermal , solar , tidal , wind , wood , waste ) . According to another source , world renewable energy-consumption was 18% in 2018 . When compared with the previous year , world energy-consumption grew at a rate of 2.9% , almost double its 10-year average of 1.5% per year , and the fastest since 2010 . Although natural processes continually form fossil fuels , such fuels are generally classified as non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made . Most air pollution deaths are due to fossil fuels , and fossil fuel phase-out would save 3.6 million lives each year .",

The program says the term greenhouse mafia is the in house name used by Australias carbon lobby for itself . The program featured former Liberal Party member Guy Pearse and Four Corners host Janine Cohen , while others concerned about the influence exerted by the fossil fuel lobby also participated . The report was based on a thesis Pearse wrote at the Australian National University between 1999 and 2005 regarding the response of Australian business to global warming . According to the program , lobby groups representing the coal , car , oil , and aluminium industries have wielded their power to prevent Australia from reducing its greenhouse gas emissions , which were already among the highest per capita in the world in 1990 .",
  "/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions": "A greenhouse gas ( sometimes abbreviated GHG ) is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range . Greenhouse gases cause the greenhouse effect on planets . The primary greenhouse gases in Earth 's atmosphere are water vapor ( H2O ) , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane ( CH4 ) , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , and ozone ( O3 ) . Without greenhouse gases , the average temperature of Earth 's surface would be about \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) , rather than the present average of 15 \u00b0C ( 59 \u00b0F ) . The atmospheres of Venus , Mars and Titan also contain greenhouse gases . Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution ( around 1750 ) have produced a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide , from 280 ppm in 1750 to 415 ppm in 2019 . This increase has occurred despite the uptake of more than half of the emissions by various natural sinks involved in the carbon cycle . The vast majority of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels , principally coal , oil , and natural gas , with additional contributions coming from deforestation , changes in land use , soil erosion and agriculture ( including livestock ) . The leading source of anthropogenic methane emissions is animal agriculture , followed by fugitive emissions from gas , oil , coal and other industry , solid waste , wastewater and rice production . At current emission rates , temperatures could increase by 2 \u00b0C , which the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) designated as the upper limit to avoid dangerous levels , by 2036 .",
  "/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol": "The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) that commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , based on the scientific consensus that ( part one ) global warming is occurring and ( part two ) it is extremely likely that human-made CO2 emissions have predominantly caused it . The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto , Japan , on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005 . There are currently 192 parties ( Canada withdrew from the protocol , effective December 2012 ) to the Protocol . The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system ( Article 2 ) . The Kyoto Protocol applies to the six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A : Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , Methane ( CH4 ) , Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , Hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) , Perfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) , and Sulphur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) . The Protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities : it acknowledges that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change , owing to economic development , and therefore puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . The Protocol 's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012 . All 36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied with the Protocol . However , nine countries had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets . The financial crisis of 2007-08 helped reduce the emissions . The greatest emission reductions were seen in the former Eastern Bloc countries because the dissolution of the Soviet Union reduced their emissions in the early 1990s . Even though the 36 developed countries reduced their emissions , the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010 .",

  "/wiki/Passive_smoking": "Passive smoking is the inhalation of smoke , called secondhand smoke ( SHS ) , or environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) , by persons other than the intended active smoker . It occurs when tobacco smoke enters an environment , causing its inhalation by people within that environment . Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke causes disease , disability , and death . The health risks of secondhand smoke are a matter of scientific consensus . These risks have been a major motivation for smoke-free laws in workplaces and indoor public places , including restaurants , bars and night clubs , as well as some open public spaces . Concerns around secondhand smoke have played a central role in the debate over the harms and regulation of tobacco products . Since the early 1970s , the tobacco industry has viewed public concern over secondhand smoke as a serious threat to its business interests . Harm to bystanders was perceived as a motivator for stricter regulation of tobacco products . Despite the industry 's awareness of the harms of secondhand smoke as early as the 1980s , the tobacco industry coordinated a scientific controversy with the purpose of stopping regulation of their products . :1242",

Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally . Internally , a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor . Externally , a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media , government , law enforcement , or those who are concerned . Whistleblowers , however , take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing . Because of this , a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers . Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers , but that protection can only go so far . Whistleblowers face legal action , criminal charges , social stigma , and termination from any position , office , or job . Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public . The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on : private sector , or public sector . Depending on many factors , both can have varying results .",

Drake was later charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 . His defenders claimed this was retaliation . The charges against him were later dropped , and he agreed to plead guilty to having committed a misdemeanor under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , something that Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project ( which helped represent him ) called an act of civil disobedience .",
  "/wiki/Thinthread": "ThinThread is the name of a project that the United States National Security Agency ( NSA ) pursued during the 1990s , according to a May 17 , 2006 article in The Baltimore Sun . The program involved wiretapping and sophisticated analysis of the resulting data , but according to the article , the program was discontinued three weeks before the September 11 , 2001 attacks due to the changes in priorities and the consolidation of U.S. intelligence authority . The change in priority consisted of the decision made by the director of NSA General Michael V. Hayden to go with a concept called Trailblazer , despite the fact that ThinThread was a working prototype that claimed to protect the privacy of U.S. citizens . ThinThread was dismissed and replaced by the Trailblazer Project , which lacked the privacy protections . A consortium led by Science Applications International Corporation was awarded a $ 280 million contract to develop Trailblazer in 2002 .",

  "/wiki/European_Commission": "The European Commission ( EC ) is the executive branch of the European Union , responsible for proposing legislation , implementing decisions , upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU . Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg City , pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate . The Commissioners are proposed by the Council of the European Union , on the basis of suggestions made by the national governments , and then appointed by the European Council after the approval of the European Parliament . It is common , although not a formal requirement , that the commissioners have previously held senior political positions , such as being a member of the European Parliament or a government minister . This EU institution operates as a cabinet government , with 27 members of the Commission ( informally known as commissioners ) . There is one member per member state , but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state . One of the 27 is the Commission President ( currently Ursula von der Leyen ) proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament . The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President , and the 27 members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament . The current Commission is the Von der Leyen Commission , which took office in December 2019 , following the European Parliament elections in May of the same year . The term Commission is variously used , either in the narrow sense of the 27-member College of Commissioners ( or College ) or to also include the administrative body of about 32,000 European civil servants who are split into departments called directorates-general and services . The procedural languages of the Commission are English , French and German . The Members of the Commission and their cabinets ( immediate teams ) are based in the Berlaymont building in Brussels .",

Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education , the University of California is a part of the state 's three-system public higher education plan , which also includes the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System . The University of California was founded on March 23 , 1868 , and operated in Oakland before moving to its campus in Berkeley in 1873 . In March 1951 , the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus at Berkeley , with Robert Gordon Sproul remaining in place as the first systemwide President , Clark Kerr becoming the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley , and Raymond B. Allen became the first Chancellor of UCLA . However , the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies , and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as President that UC was able to evolve into a system from 1957 to 1960 . In the 21st century , the University of California has 10 campuses , a combined student body of 280,380 students , 21,200 faculty members , 144,000 staff members and over 1.86 million living alumni , as governed by a semi-autonomous Board of Regents . Its tenth and newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005 . Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students ; one campus , UC San Francisco , enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences . In addition , the UC Hastings College of Law , located in San Francisco , is legally affiliated with UC , but other than sharing its name is entirely autonomous from the rest of the system . The University of California also manages or co-manages three national laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy : Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) , and Los Alamos National Laboratory ( LANL ) . Collectively , the colleges , institutions , and alumni of the University of California make it the most comprehensive and advanced postsecondary educational system in the world , responsible for nearly $ 50 billion per year of economic impact . UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline , with UC faculty and researchers having won at least 62 Nobel Prizes as of 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory": "Los Alamos National Laboratory ( Los Alamos or LANL for short ) is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory initially organized during World War II for the design of nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project . It is located a short distance northwest of Santa Fe , New Mexico in the southwestern US . Los Alamos was selected as the top secret location for bomb design in late 1942 , and officially commissioned the next year , under the management of University of California . At the time it was known as Project Y and was the center for weapon design and overall coordination . Other labs , today known as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Hanford Site , concentrated on the production of uranium and plutonium bomb fuels . Los Alamos was the heart of the project , collecting together some of the world 's most famous scientists , among them numerous Nobel Prize winners . The site was known variously as Project Y , Los Alamos Laboratory , and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory through this period . The lab 's existence was announced to the world in the post-WWII era , when it became known universally as Los Alamos . In 1952 , the Atomic Energy Commission formed a second design lab under the direction of the University of California , Berkeley , becoming the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) . Since that date the two labs have competed on a wide variety of bomb designs . With the ending of the Cold War , both labs turned their focus increasingly to civilian missions . Today , Los Alamos is one of the largest science and technology institutions in the world .",

  "/wiki/State_Secrets_Privilege": "The state secrets privilege is an evidentiary rule created by United States legal precedent . Application of the privilege results in exclusion of evidence from a legal case based solely on affidavits submitted by the government stating that court proceedings might disclose sensitive information which might endanger national security . United States v. Reynolds , which involved military secrets , was the first case that saw formal recognition of the privilege . Following a claim of state secrets privilege , the court rarely conducts an in camera examination of the evidence to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause to support the use of this doctrine . This results in court rulings in which even the judge has not verified the veracity of the assertion .

As later set by the Judiciary Act of 1869 , the Court consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices . Each justice has lifetime tenure , meaning they remain on the Court until they resign , retire , die , or are removed from office . When a vacancy occurs , the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate , appoints a new justice . Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it .

The agency has asserted preemptive regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions , but this has been disputed by such state regulatory agencies as the California Air Resources Board . The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are contained in the United States Code of Federal Regulations , Title 49 , Part 571 . This is commonly referred to as 49CFR571 , with any particular FMVSS appended after a period ; for example 49CFR571.301 is the location of FMVSS 301 .

This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the End of major combat operations , after which the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005 . U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011 . The U.S.-led coalition sent 177,194 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase , which lasted from 19 March to 1 May 2003 . About 130,000 arrived from the U.S. alone , with about 45,000 British soldiers , 2,000 Australian soldiers , and 194 Polish soldiers . 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath . In preparation for the invasion , 100,000 U.S. troops assembled in Kuwait by 18 February . The coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan . According to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , the coalition aimed to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , to end Saddam Hussein 's support for terrorism , and to free the Iraqi people . Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the September 11 attacks , on the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations , and the rise of the freedom agenda . According to Blair , the trigger was Iraq 's failure to take a final opportunity to disarm itself of alleged nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace ."
