Produced by Working Title Films in association with StudioCanal , the film was released on 16 September 2005 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and on 11 November in the United States . Screenwriter Deborah Moggach initially attempted to make her script as faithful to the novel as possible , writing from Elizabeth 's perspective while preserving much of the original dialogue . Wright , who was directing his first feature film , encouraged greater deviation from the text , including changing the dynamics within the Bennet family . Wright and Moggach set the film in an earlier period and avoided depicting a perfectly clean Regency world , presenting instead a muddy hem version of the time . It was shot entirely on location in England on a 15-week schedule . Wright found casting difficult due to past performances of particular characters . The filmmakers had to balance who they thought was best for each role with the studio 's desire for stars .
