It borders Denmark to the north , Poland and the Czech Republic to the east , Austria and Switzerland to the south , France to the southwest , and Luxembourg , Belgium , and the Netherlands to the west . Germany includes 16 constituent states , covers an area of 357,386 square kilometres ( 137,988 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . With 83 million inhabitants , it is the second most populous state of Europe after Russia , the most populous state lying entirely in Europe , as well as the most populous member state of the European Union . Germany is a very decentralised country . Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin , while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country 's busiest airport . Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848-49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights .",
  "/wiki/Berlin_Wall": "The Berlin Wall ( German : Berliner Mauer , pronounced [ b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0250 \u02c8ma\u028a\u032f\u0250 ] ( listen ) ) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989 . Construction of the Wall was commenced by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) on 13 August 1961 . The Wall cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany , including East Berlin . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the death strip ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , beds of nails , and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people from building a socialist state in East Germany . GDR authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart ( German : Antifaschistischer Schutzwall ) . The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the Wall of Shame , a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall 's restriction on freedom of movement . Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border ( IGB ) , which demarcated the border between East and West Germany , it came to physically symbolize the Iron Curtain that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War . Before the Wall 's erection , 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR , many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin ; from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries . Between 1961 and 1989 , the Wall prevented almost all such emigration . During this period , over 100,000 people attempted to escape , and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall , with an estimated death toll ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin . In 1989 , a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries - in Poland and Hungary in particular - caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall .",
  "/wiki/Cold_War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies , the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc , after World War II . The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union . The term cold is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers , but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars . The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers , following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 . Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism , respectively , the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature . Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side , on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker - the doctrine of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) . Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment , the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare , massive propaganda campaigns and espionage , far-reaching embargoes , rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race . The West was led by the United States , a federal republic with a two-party presidential system , as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies . [ A ] The Soviet Union was a self-declared Marxist-Leninist state that had a totalitarian government ultimately led by a committee known as the Politburo . The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) had influence across the Second World . The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world , while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world . As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945-1960 , they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War .",

At 450,295 square kilometres ( 173,860 sq mi ) , Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe , the third-largest country in the European Union and the fifth largest country in Europe by area . The capital city is Stockholm . Sweden has a total population of 10.3 million of which 2.5 million have a foreign background . Persons who have foreign backgrounds are defined as persons who are foreign born , or born in Sweden with foreign born parents . It has a low population density of 22 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 57/sq mi ) and the highest urban concentration is in the central and southern half of the country . Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia . The climate is in general mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence . In spite of the high latitude , Sweden often has warm continental summers , being located in between the North Atlantic , the Baltic Sea and the vast Eurasian Russian landmass . The general climate and environment varies significantly from the south and north due to the vast latitudal difference and much of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy winters .

The bridge runs nearly 8 kilometres ( 5 miles ) from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait . The crossing is completed by the 4-kilometre ( 2.5 mi ) Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager . The \u00d6resund Bridge is the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe and connects two major metropolitan areas : Copenhagen , the Danish capital city , and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 . It connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with those of Central and Western Europe . A data cable also makes the bridge the backbone of internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden ( and , prior to 2016 also Finland ) . The international European route E20 crosses via road , the \u00d8resund Line via railway . The construction of the Great Belt Fixed Link ( 1988-1998 ) , connecting Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula , and the \u00d6resund Bridge have connected Central and Western Europe to Scandinavia by road and rail . The \u00d6resund Bridge was designed by the Danish engineering firm COWI . The justification for the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel for part of the way , rather than raising that section of the bridge , was to avoid interfering with air traffic from the nearby Copenhagen Airport , to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad , and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait . The \u00d6resund Bridge crosses the border between Denmark and Sweden . Although the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic Passport Union should mean no routine passport inspections , since January 2016 , identity and visa checks have been imposed by Sweden on travellers from Denmark due to the European migrant crisis .",

The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road . Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union , governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state . The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years , starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion . After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture .",

  "/wiki/Hoover_Dam": "Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River , on the border between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona . It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30 , 1935 , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers , and cost over one hundred lives . Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933 , it was officially renamed Hoover Dam , for President Herbert Hoover , by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947 . Since about 1900 , the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods , provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power . In 1928 , Congress authorized the project . The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies , Inc. , which began construction of the dam in early 1931 . Such a large concrete structure had never been built before , and some of the techniques were unproven . The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties . Nevertheless , Six Companies turned the dam over to the federal government on March 1 , 1936 , more than two years ahead of schedule . Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the United States by volume ( when it is full ) . The dam is located near Boulder City , Nevada , a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project , about 30 mi ( 48 km ) southeast of Las Vegas , Nevada .",
  "/wiki/Colorado_River": "The Colorado River is one of the principal rivers ( along with the Rio Grande ) in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico . The 1,450-mile-long ( 2,330 km ) river drains an expansive , arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states . Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado , the river flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border , where it turns south toward the international border . After entering Mexico , the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora . Known for its dramatic canyons , whitewater rapids , and eleven U.S. National Parks , the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people . The river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts , which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply . Its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power , and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West . Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower 100 miles ( 160 km ) of the river , which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s . Beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers , Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years . Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago , the watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations - considered some of the most sophisticated indigenous North American cultures - which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices . Most native peoples that inhabit the region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1,000 years ago . Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16th century , when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area , which became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 .",

  "/wiki/Supertanker": "An oil tanker , also known as a petroleum tanker , is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products . There are two basic types of oil tankers : crude tankers and product tankers . Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries . For example , moving crude oil from oil wells in a producing country to refineries in another country . Product tankers , generally much smaller , are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets . For example , moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations . Oil tankers are often classified by their size as well as their occupation . The size classes range from inland or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) to the mammoth ultra large crude carriers ( ULCCs ) of 550,000 DWT . Tankers move approximately 2.0 billion metric tons ( 2.2 billion short tons ) of oil every year . Second only to pipelines in terms of efficiency , the average cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only US $ 5 to $ 8 per cubic metre ( $ 0.02 to $ 0.03 per US gallon ) . Some specialized types of oil tankers have evolved . One of these is the naval replenishment oiler , a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel .",
  "/wiki/Liquified_Natural_Gas": "Liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) is natural gas ( predominantly methane , CH4 , with some mixture of ethane , C2H6 ) that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport . It takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state ( at standard conditions for temperature and pressure ) . It is odorless , colorless , non-toxic and non-corrosive . Hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state , freezing and asphyxia . The liquefaction process involves removal of certain components , such as dust , acid gases , helium , water , and heavy hydrocarbons , which could cause difficulty downstream . The natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure by cooling it to approximately \u2212162 \u00b0C ( \u2212260 \u00b0F ) ; maximum transport pressure is set at around 25 kPa ( 4 psi ) .",
  "/wiki/AH-64_Apache": "The Boeing AH-64 Apache is an American twin-turboshaft attack helicopter with a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement and a tandem cockpit for a crew of two .

It is armed with a 30 mm ( 1.18 in ) M230 chain gun carried between the main landing gear , under the aircraft 's forward fuselage , and four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores , typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods . The AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability . The Apache began as the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army 's Advanced Attack Helicopter program to replace the AH-1 Cobra . The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975 . The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976 , and later approved full production in 1982 . After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984 , McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development . The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986 . The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997 . Production has been continued by Boeing Defense , Space & Security , with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013 .

The capital and largest city is Panama City , whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country 's 4 million people . Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century . It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia , a union of Nueva Granada , Ecuador , and Venezuela . After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831 , Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia . With the backing of the United States , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 , allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 . The 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31 , 1999 . Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama 's GDP , although commerce , banking , and tourism are major and growing sectors . It is regarded as a high-income country . In 2018 Panama ranked 66th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index . In 2018 , Panama was ranked seventh-most competitive economy in Latin America , according to the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Index . Covering around 40 percent of its land area , Panama 's jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals - some of them found nowhere else on earth .",
  "/wiki/Panama_Canal": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panam\u00e1 ) is an artificial 82 km ( 51 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade . Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 32.5 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , neo-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression Another Day , Another Dollar comes from , as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor . France began work on the canal in 1881 , but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait . Colombia , France , and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark , and Sweden .",
