  "/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate": "West Texas intermediate ( WTI ) , also known as Texas light sweet , is a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing . This grade is described as light crude oil because of its relatively low density , and sweet because of its low sulfur content . It is the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange 's oil futures contracts . The price of WTI is often included in news reports on oil prices , alongside the price of Brent crude from the North Sea . Other important oil markers include the Dubai crude , Oman crude , Urals oil , and the OPEC reference basket . WTI is lighter and sweeter , containing less sulfur , than Brent , and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman .",

  "/wiki/Brent_Crude": "Brent Crude is a major trading classification of sweet light crude oil that serves as one of the two main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide , the other being West Texas Intermediate . This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density , and sweet because of its low sulphur content . Brent Crude is extracted from the North Sea and comprises Brent Blend , Forties Blend , Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes ( also known as the BFOE Quotation ) . The Brent Crude oil marker is also known as Brent Blend , London Brent and Brent petroleum . Brent is the leading global price benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils . It is used to price two thirds of the world 's internationally traded crude oil supplies .",
  "/wiki/Ethanol": "Ethanol ( also called ethyl alcohol , grain alcohol , drinking alcohol , or simply alcohol ) is a chemical compound , a simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H6O . Its formula can be also written as CH3\u2212CH2\u2212OH or C2H5OH ( an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group ) , and is often abbreviated as EtOH . Ethanol is a volatile , flammable , colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor . It is a psychoactive substance and is the principal active ingredient found in alcoholic drinks . Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes , and is commonly consumed as a popular recreational drug . It also has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant . The compound is widely used as a chemical solvent , either for scientific chemical testing or in synthesis of other organic compounds , and is a vital substance used across many different kinds of manufacturing industries . Ethanol is also used as an alternative fuel source .",

  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .",
  "/wiki/British_Thermal_Unit": "The British thermal unit ( Btu or BTU ) is a non-SI , traditional unit of heat ; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit . It is also part of the United States customary units . Its counterpart in the old metric system is the calorie , which is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius . Heat is now known to be equivalent to energy , for which the SI unit is the joule ; one BTU is about 1055 joules . While units of heat are often supplanted by energy units in scientific work , they are still used in many fields . As examples , in the United States the price of natural gas is quoted in dollars per million BTUs .",
  "/wiki/Heating_oil": "Heating oil is a low viscosity , liquid petroleum product used as a fuel oil for furnaces or boilers in buildings . Home heating oil is often abbreviated as HHO . Heating oil consists of a mixture of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons in the 14- to 20-carbon atom range that condense between 250 and 350 \u00b0C ( 482 and 662 \u00b0F ) during oil refining . Heating oil condenses at a lower temperature than petroleum jelly , bitumen , candle wax , and lubricating oil , but at a higher temperature than kerosene , which condenses between 160-250 \u00b0C ( 320-482 \u00b0F ) . The heavy ( C20+ ) hydrocarbons condense between 340-400 \u00b0C ( 644-752 \u00b0F ) . Heating oil produces 138,500 British thermal units per US gallon ( 38.6 MJ/l ) and weighs 8.2 pounds per US gallon ( 0.95 kg/l ) . Number 2 fuel oil has a flash point of 52 \u00b0C ( 126 \u00b0F ) . Most heating oil products are chemically very similar to diesel fuel used as motor fuel . In many markets heating oil and on-road diesel fuels are the same product sold out of the same truck in route labeled as either heating oil or dyed diesel respectively dependent on the person ordering product . The legal difference between diesel and heating oil in the United States is sulfur allowance . Diesel for machinery and equipment must be below 15ppm sulfur content while heating oil must be below 500 ppm sulfur . This means that the two can often be successfully interchanged for heating or boiler systems .",
  "/wiki/Propane": "Propane ( /\u02c8pro\u028ape\u026an/ ) is a three-carbon alkane with the molecular formula C3H8 . It is a gas at standard temperature and pressure , but compressible to a transportable liquid . A by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining , it is commonly used as a fuel . Discovered in 1857 by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot , it became commercially available in the US by 1911 . Propane is one of a group of liquefied petroleum gases ( LP gases ) . The others include butane , propylene , butadiene , butylene , isobutylene , and mixtures thereof . Propane gas has become a popular choice for barbecues and portable stoves because its low boiling point makes it vaporize as soon as it is released from its pressurized container . Propane powers buses , forklifts , taxis , outboard boat motors , and ice resurfacing machines and is used for heat and cooking in recreational vehicles and campers . Propane is also used in some locomotive diesel engines to improve combustion . Propane is a simple asphyxiant . Unlike natural gas , propane is denser than air . It may accumulate in low spaces and near the floor .",
  "/wiki/Terephthalic_acid": "Terephthalic acid is an organic compound with formula C6H4 ( CO2H ) 2 . This white solid is a commodity chemical , used principally as a precursor to the polyester PET , used to make clothing and plastic bottles . Several million tonnes are produced annually . The common name is derived from the turpentine-producing tree Pistacia terebinthus and phthalic acid .",
