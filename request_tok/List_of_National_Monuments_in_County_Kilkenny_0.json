  "/wiki/Irish_round_tower": "Irish round towers ( Irish : Cloigtheach ( singular ) , Cloigthithe ( plural ) - literally bell house ) are early medieval stone towers of a type found mainly in Ireland , with two in Scotland and one on the Isle of Man . As their name Cloigtheach indicates , they were originally bell towers , though they may have been later used for additional purposes . Generally found in the vicinity of a church or monastery , the door of the tower faces the west doorway of the church . In this way , it has been possible to determine without excavation the approximate site of lost churches , where the tower still exists",

The largest number outside Ireland are in Pembrokeshire , Wales . The vast majority of the inscriptions consist of personal names .

  "/wiki/High_cross": "A high cross or standing cross ( Irish : cros ard / ardchros , Scottish Gaelic : crois \u00e0rd / \u00e0rd-chrois , Welsh : croes uchel / croes eglwysig ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated . There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses , usually outdoors . These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood , perhaps with metalwork attachments , and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones ; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form . The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria , which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries ; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain . Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork , interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls , all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork . They were probably normally painted , perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster ; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs , in particular scenes crowded with small figures , are often now rather indistinct and hard to read . The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high , but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later , retaining thick massive proportions , giving large surface areas for carving . The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice , County Louth . It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high . Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison , but could be large ; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures . The crosses often , though not always , feature a stone ring around the intersection , forming a Celtic cross ; this seems clearly an innovation of Celtic Christianity , perhaps at Iona . The term high cross is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland , but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon , though there are certainly strong regional variations",

  "/wiki/Donjon": "A keep ( from the Middle English kype ) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility . Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep , but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences , used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary . The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the Motte-and-Bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century ; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066 , and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s . The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries ; these included Norman keeps , with a square or rectangular design , and circular shell keeps . Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build . During the 12th century , new designs began to be introduced - in France , quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced , while in England polygonal towers were built . By the end of the century , French and English keep designs began to diverge : Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories , while in England castles were built without keeps . In Spain , keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles , although in Germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion . In the second half of the 14th century , there was a resurgence in the building of keeps . In France , the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall , heavily machicolated designs , a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design . Meanwhile , tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles : these large keeps , each uniquely designed , formed part of the grandest castles built during the period . In the 15th century , the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery",

  "/wiki/Cistercian": "The Cistercians ( /s\u026a\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0r\u0283\u0259nz/ ) officially the Order of Cistercians ( Latin : ( Sacer ) Ordo Cisterciensis , abbreviated as OCist or SOCist ) , are a Catholic religious order of monks and nuns that branched off from the Benedictines and follow the Rule of Saint Benedict . They are also known as Bernardines , after the highly influential Bernard of Clairvaux ( though that term is also used of one of the Franciscan Orders in Poland and Lithuania ) ; or as White Monks , in reference to the colour of the cuccula or white choir robe worn by the Cistercians over their habits , as opposed to the black cuccula worn by Benedictine monks . The term Cistercian ( French Cistercien ) , derives from Cistercium , the Latin name for the village of C\u00eeteaux , near Dijon in eastern France . It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded C\u00eeteaux Abbey in 1098 , with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict . The best known of them were Robert of Molesme , Alberic of C\u00eeteaux and the English monk Stephen Harding , who were the first three abbots . Bernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order . By the end of the 12th century , the order had spread throughout France and into England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , Italy , Scandinavia and Eastern Europe . The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Rule of St Benedict . Rejecting the developments the Benedictines had undergone , the monks tried to replicate monastic life as it had been in Saint Benedict 's time ; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity . The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour , especially agricultural work in the fields , a special characteristic of Cistercian life . The Cistercians also made major contributions to culture and technology in medieval Europe : Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture ; and the Cistercians were the main force of technological diffusion in fields such as agriculture , hydraulic engineering , and metallurgy . The original emphasis of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency , and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales",

The oldest known are found in Western Europe , dating from c 7,000 years ago . Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens , which makes it difficult to know why they did it . They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers , despite the absence of clear evidence for this . Human remains , sometimes accompanied by artefacts , have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using radiocarbon dating . However , it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place"
