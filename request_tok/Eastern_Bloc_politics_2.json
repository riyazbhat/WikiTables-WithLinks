  "/wiki/Stasi": "The Ministry for State Security ( German : Ministerium f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit , MfS ) or State Security Service ( Staatssicherheitsdienst , SSD ) , commonly known as the Stasi ( IPA : [ \u02c8\u0283ta\u02d0zi\u02d0 ] ) , [ n 1 ] was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) . It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies ever to have existed . The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin , with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city . The Stasi motto was Schild und Schwert der Partei ( Shield and Sword of the Party ) , referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands , SED ) and also echoing a theme of the KGB , the Soviet counterpart and close partner , with respect to its own ruling party , the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) . Erich Mielke was the Stasi 's longest-serving chief , in power for thirty-two of the GDR 's forty years of existence . One of its main tasks was spying on the population , mainly through a vast network of citizens turned informants , and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures , including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents ( Zersetzung , literally meaning decomposition ) . It arrested 250,000 people as political prisoners during its existence . Its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance ( Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung ) was responsible for both espionage and for conducting covert operations in foreign countries . Under its long-time head Markus Wolf , this directorate gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War . The Stasi also maintained contacts , and occasionally cooperated , with Western terrorists . Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990 . After German reunification , the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were laid open , so that any citizen could inspect their personal file on request ; these files are now maintained by the Stasi Records Agency .",

Commonly described as a communist state in English usage , it described itself as a socialist workers ' and peasants ' state . It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II - the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement , bounded on the east by the Oder-Neisse line . The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it ; as a result , West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR . The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone , while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones . East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union . Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 , and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949 . However , Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War . Until 1989 , the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation , the National Front . The SED made the teaching of Marxism-Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools . The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned . Prices of housing , basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand ; and were heavily subsidised .",

The dead bodies of Falck and Gr\u00e4ns were later found at the bottom of the Hammarby Canal in Stockholm . The deaths remain unsolved but later reports claim that they were assassinated in a state-sponsored operation by agents from East Germany . Cats Falck was born in Enskede in Stockholm , Sweden . At the time of her disappearance , Falck was employed as a reporter for the Swedish public service television news program Rapport . Prior to her disappearance , Falck had told her work-mates and her fianc\u00e9 ( the author Lasse Str\u00f6mstedt ) that she was about to reveal something big . She also claimed that when the story broke , she would get Stora Journalistpriset , The Swedish Grand Prize for Journalism . In retrospect , several fellow journalists have claimed it would be very strange for a journalist to not inform her superiors that she was onto something big . If she had informed them , she would have been given more time and resources to pursue the story .",

  "/wiki/Berlin_Wall": "The Berlin Wall ( German : Berliner Mauer , pronounced [ b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0250 \u02c8ma\u028a\u032f\u0250 ] ( listen ) ) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989 . Construction of the Wall was commenced by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) on 13 August 1961 . The Wall cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany , including East Berlin . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the death strip ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , beds of nails , and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people from building a socialist state in East Germany . GDR authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart ( German : Antifaschistischer Schutzwall ) . The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the Wall of Shame , a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall 's restriction on freedom of movement . Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border ( IGB ) , which demarcated the border between East and West Germany , it came to physically symbolize the Iron Curtain that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War . Before the Wall 's erection , 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR , many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin ; from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries . Between 1961 and 1989 , the Wall prevented almost all such emigration . During this period , over 100,000 people attempted to escape , and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall , with an estimated death toll ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin . In 1989 , a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries - in Poland and Hungary in particular - caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall .",

It involved more than one million people in about 700 localities . The uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the Soviet occupation forces , and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei . In spite of the intervention of Soviet troops , the wave of strikes and protests were not easily brought under control . There were demonstrations in more than 500 towns and villages after 17 June . The date , 17 June , was celebrated as a public holiday in West Germany up until the German reunification , after which it was replaced by German Unity Day , celebrated annually on 3 October . Strikes and working class networks , particularly relating to the old Social Democratic Party of Germany , anti-communist resistance networks and trade unions played a key role in the unfolding of the uprising . The event was always significantly downplayed in the Soviet Union .",

The KdA was a civil reserve force tied to the GDR 's Ministry of the Interior and the Volkspolizei , reaching 211,000 personnel at its peak in 1980 .

The Grenztruppen were the primary force guarding the Berlin Wall and the Inner German border , the GDR 's international borders between West Berlin and West Germany respectively . The force belonged to the Ministry of National Defence ( MfNV ) from 1961 , and was a service branch of the National People 's Army until 1971 when it became directly subordinate to the MfNV . The Border Troops numbered approximately 47,000 personnel at its peak , consisting of volunteers and conscripts , the third-largest Warsaw Pact border guard after the Soviet Union and Poland . The Grenztruppen 's main role was preventing Republikflucht , the illegal migration from the GDR , and were controversially responsible for many deaths at the Berlin Wall . At least 29 border guards were killed in the line of duty , and many faced criminal charges after German Reunification .",

Not including the similar and physically separate Berlin Wall , the border was 1,393 kilometres ( 866 mi ) long and ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia . It was formally established on 1 July 1945 as the boundary between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of former Nazi Germany . On the eastern side , it was made one of the world 's most heavily fortified frontiers , defined by a continuous line of high metal fences and walls , barbed wire , alarms , anti-vehicle ditches , watchtowers , automatic booby traps , and minefields . It was patrolled by 50,000 armed East German guards who faced tens of thousands of West German , British , and US guards and soldiers . In the hinterlands behind the border were more than a million North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) and Warsaw Pact troops . The border was a physical manifestation of Sir Winston Churchill 's metaphorical Iron Curtain that separated the Soviet and Western blocs during the Cold War . It marked the boundary between two economic systems - capitalism and socialism . Built by East Germany in phases from 1952 to the late 1980s , the fortifications were constructed to stop the large-scale emigration of East German citizens to the West , about 1,000 of whom are said to have died trying to cross it during its 45-year existence . It caused widespread economic and social disruption on both sides ; East Germans living in the region suffered especially draconian restrictions . The better-known Berlin Wall was a physically separate , less elaborate , and much shorter border barrier surrounding West Berlin , more than 155 kilometres ( 96 mi ) to the east of the inner German border . Berlin , which was entirely within the Soviet zone , had been similarly divided by the four powers after World War II , thus creating an exclave surrounded by East Germany that was closely aligned with ( but not formally part of ) West Germany .",
  "/wiki/Transportpolizei": "The Transportpolizei ( German for Transport Police ) was the transit police of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) , whose officers were commonly nicknamed TraPos . It was part of the Volkspolizei and dealt with all modes of transit but primarily with trains and railroads . It consisted of approximately 8,500 men , that were organized from a national level and at district level with each Deutsche Reichsbahn district ; Berlin , Cottbus , Dresden , Erfurt , Greifswald , Halle , Magdeburg and Schwerin . They wore dark-blue uniforms ( that were colloquially called blueberries ) instead of the standard green Volkspolizei uniform . They were organized into sixteen companies and equipped with small arms and RPG-7 shoulder-fired antitank grenade launchers . The Transportpolizei supervised all larger train stations and controlled the travellers , particularly at the border with West Germany , and directed traffic . Before the building of the Berlin Wall , the Transportpolizei controlled the S-Bahn in West Berlin ( as the Deutsche Reichsbahn controlled the S-Bahn in both East and West Berlin ) . In the 'interzone courses ' ( later called 'transit courses ' ) there was always an escort party of the Transportpolizei present . The service training school of the Transportpolizei was in Halle . From January 1953 until February 1957 the Transportpolizei was part of the Ministry for State Security , in turn part of the Office of the Secretary of State . Starting from March 1957 it was transferred to the Volkspolizei , whose supervising inspector was Otto Auerswald . After German reunification in 1990 the Transportpolizei was dissolved , with some 1200 of its personnel transferring to the ( West ) German Bahnpolizei .",

Established in 1917 as NKVD of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic , the agency was originally tasked with conducting regular police work and overseeing the country 's prisons and labor camps . It was disbanded in 1930 , with its functions being dispersed among other agencies , only to be reinstated as an all-union ministry in 1934 . The functions of the OGPU ( the secret police organization ) were transferred to the NKVD in 1934 , giving it a monopoly over law enforcement activities that lasted until the end of World War II . During this period , the NKVD included both ordinary public order activities , as well as secret police activities . The NKVD is known for its role in political repression and for carrying out the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin . It was led by Genrikh Yagoda , Nikolai Yezhov and Lavrentiy Beria . The NKVD undertook mass extrajudicial executions of untold numbers of citizens , and conceived , populated and administered the Gulag system of forced labour camps . Their agents were responsible for the repression of the wealthier peasantry , as well as the mass deportations of entire nationalities to uninhabited regions of the country . They oversaw the protection of Soviet borders and espionage ( which included political assassinations ) , and enforced Soviet policy in communist movements and puppet governments in other countries , most notably the repression and massacres in Poland . In March 1946 all People 's Commissariats were renamed to Ministries , and the NKVD became the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) .",

Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization .

Though the killings also occurred in the Kalinin and Kharkiv prisons and elsewhere , the massacre is named after the Katyn Forest , where some of the mass graves were first discovered . The massacre was initiated in NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria 's proposal of 5 March 1940 to execute all captive members of the Polish officer corps , approved by the Soviet Politburo led by Joseph Stalin . Of the total killed , about 8,000 were officers imprisoned during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland , another 6,000 were police officers , and the remaining 8,000 were Polish intelligentsia the Soviets deemed to be intelligence agents , gendarmes , landowners , saboteurs , factory owners , lawyers , officials , and priests . The Polish Army officer class was representative of the multi-ethnic Polish state ; the murdered included ethnic Poles , Polish Ukrainians , Belarusians , and Polish Jews including the Chief Rabbi of the Polish Army , Baruch Steinberg . The government of Nazi Germany announced the discovery of mass graves in the Katyn Forest in April 1943 . Stalin severed diplomatic relations with the London-based Polish government-in-exile when it asked for an investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross . The USSR claimed the Nazis had killed the victims , and it continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990 , when it officially acknowledged and condemned the killings by the NKVD , as well as the subsequent cover-up by the Soviet government . [ a ] An investigation conducted by the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union ( 1990-1991 ) and the Russian Federation ( 1991-2004 ) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres , but refused to classify this action as a war crime or as an act of mass murder . The investigation was closed on the grounds the perpetrators were dead , and since the Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge , formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable . In November 2010 , the Russian State Duma approved a declaration blaming Stalin and other Soviet officials for ordering the massacre .",

It involved a large-scale purge of the Communist Party and government officials , repression of kulaks ( affluent peasants ) and the Red Army leadership , widespread police surveillance , suspicion of saboteurs , counter-revolutionaries , imprisonment , and arbitrary executions . Historians estimate the total number of deaths due to Stalinist repression in 1937-38 to be between 680,000 and 1,200,000 . In the Western world , Robert Conquest 's 1968 book The Great Terror popularized that phrase . Conquest 's title was in turn an allusion to the period called the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution ( French : la Terreur , and , from June to July 1794 , la Grande Terreur , the Great Terror ) .",

The meetings enabled both parties to pursue specific goals and aims as outlined independently by Hitler and Stalin , with regard to the acquired , formerly Polish territories . The conferences were held by the Gestapo and the NKVD officials in several Polish cities . In spite of their differences on other issues , both Heinrich Himmler and Lavrentiy Beria had similar objectives as far as the fate of the prewar Poland was concerned . The attack on Poland ended with the Nazi-Soviet parade in Brze\u015b\u0107 , which was held on 22 September 1939 . Brze\u015b\u0107 was the location of the first Nazi-Soviet meeting organized on 27 September 1939 , in which the prisoner exchange was decided prior to the signing of mutual agreements in Moscow a day later . In the following month , the Gestapo and the NKVD met in Lw\u00f3w to discuss the fate of civilian populations during radical reorganization of the annexed territories . They met again in occupied Przemy\u015bl at the end of November , because Przemy\u015bl was a border crossing between the two invaders . The next series of meetings began in December 1939 , a month after the first transfer of Polish prisoners of war . The conferences were held in occupied Krak\u00f3w in the General Government on 6-7 December 1939 ; and continued for the next two days in the resort town of Zakopane in the Tatra Mountains of southern Poland ( 100 km from Krak\u00f3w ) on 8-9 December 1939 .

Mass graves in Vinnytsia were discovered during the German occupation of Ukraine in 1943 . The investigation of the site first conducted by the international Katyn Commission coincided with the discovery of a similar mass murder site of Polish prisoners of war in Katyn .

It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine , and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine or the Ukrainian Genocide of 1932-33 . It was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932-33 , which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country . During the Holodomor , millions of inhabitants of Ukraine , the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians , died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine . Since 2006 , the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 15 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government . Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials varied greatly . According to higher estimates , up to 12 million ethnic Ukrainians were said to have perished as a result of the famine . A U.N. joint statement signed by 25 countries in 2003 declared that 7-10 million perished . Research has since narrowed the estimates to between 3.3 and 7.5 million . According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kiev in 2010 , the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million , with 3.9 million direct famine deaths , and a further 6.1 million birth deficits . The term Holodomor emphasises the famine 's man-made and intentional aspects , such as rejection of outside aid , confiscation of all household foodstuffs , and restriction of population movement . Whether the Holodomor was genocide is still the subject of academic debate , as are the causes of the famine and intentionality of the deaths .",

The agency was a military service governed by army laws and regulations , in the same fashion as the Soviet Army or MVD Internal Troops . While most of the KGB archives remain classified , two online documentary sources are available . Its main functions were foreign intelligence , counter-intelligence , operative-investigatory activities , guarding the State Border of the USSR , guarding the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government , organization and ensuring of government communications as well as combating nationalism , dissent , and anti-Soviet activities . In 1991 , after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the KGB was split into the Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation . After breaking away from Georgia in the early 1990s with Russian help , the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia established its own KGB ( keeping this unreformed name ) .

  "/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956": "The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 ( Hungarian : 1956-os forradalom ) , or the Hungarian Uprising , was a nationwide revolution against the Hungarian People 's Republic and its Soviet-imposed policies , lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956 . Leaderless at the beginning , it was the first major threat to Soviet control since the Red Army drove Nazi Germany from its territory at the End of World War II in Europe . The revolt began as a student protest , which attracted thousands as they marched through central Budapest to the Hungarian Parliament building , calling out on the streets using a van with loudspeakers . A student delegation , entering the radio building to try to broadcast the students ' demands , was detained . When the delegation 's release was demanded by the protesters outside , they were fired upon from within the building by the State Security Police , known as the \u00c1VH ( acronym for \u00c1llamv\u00e9delmi Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g , literally State Protection Authority ) . One student died and was wrapped in a flag and held above the crowd . This was the start of the next phase of the revolution . As the news spread , disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital . The revolt spread quickly and the government collapsed . Thousands organised themselves into militias , battling the \u00c1VH and Soviet troops . During the revolt there were violent incidents , some local leaders and \u00c1VH members were lynched or captured , while former political prisoners were released and armed . Radical impromptu workers ' councils wrested municipal control from the ruling Hungarian Working People 's Party ( Hu : Magyar Dolgoz\u00f3k P\u00e1rtja ) and demanded political change .",

It began on 5 January 1968 , when reformist Alexander Dub\u010dek was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia ( KS\u010c ) , and continued until 21 August 1968 , when the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded the country to suppress the reforms . The Prague Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dub\u010dek to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization . The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media , speech and travel . After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics , Bohemia , Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia , Dub\u010dek oversaw the decision to split into two , the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic . This dual federation was the only formal change that survived the invasion . The reforms , especially the decentralization of administrative authority , were not received well by the Soviets , who , after failed negotiations , sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country . The New York Times cited reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue . A massive wave of emigration swept the nation . Resistance was mounted throughout the country , involving attempted fraternization , sabotage of street signs , defiance of curfews , etc . While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country , the resistance held out for eight months until it was finally circumvented by diplomatic maneuvers . It became a high-profile example of civilian-based defense ; there were sporadic acts of violence and several protest suicides by self-immolation ( the most famous being that of Jan Palach ) , but no military resistance .",

The People 's Republic of Bulgaria existed from 1946 to 1990 and it was ruled by the Bulgarian Communist Party ( BCP ) , which in turn ruled together with its coalition partner , the Bulgarian Agrarian People 's Union ( former communist ally ) . Bulgaria was part of Comecon and a member of the Warsaw Pact and was closely allied with the Soviet Union during the Cold War . The Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II deposed the Kingdom of Bulgaria administration in the Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944 which ended the country 's alliance with the Axis powers and led to the People 's Republic in 1946 . The BCP modelled its policies after those of the Soviet Union , transforming the country over the course of a decade from an agrarian peasant society into an industrialized socialist society . In the mid-1950s and after the death of Stalin , conservative hardliners lost influence and a period of social liberalization and stability followed under Todor Zhivkov . Varying degrees of conservative or liberal influence followed . After a new energy and transportation infrastructure was constructed , by 1960 manufacturing became the dominant sector of the economy and Bulgaria became a major exporter of household goods and later on computer technologies , earning it the nickname of Silicon Valley of the Eastern Bloc . The country 's relatively high productivity levels and high scores on social development rankings made it a model for other socialist countries ' administrative policies . In 1989 , after a few years of liberal influence , political reforms were initiated and Todor Zhivkov , who had served as head of the party since 1954 , was removed from office in a BCP congress . In 1990 , under the leadership of Georgi Parvanov , the BCP changed its name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP ) and adopted a centre-left political ideology in place of Marxism-Leninism .

From 1944 to 1946 , it was known as the Democratic Government of Albania and from 1946 to 1976 it was known as the People 's Republic of Albania . Throughout this period , the country was ruled by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania . They ruled Albania by establishing a Stalinist style of state administration and adhering to policies which stressed national unity and self-reliance . Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or travel from . In 1967 , it declared itself the world 's first atheist state . But after the end of its communist regime in 1991 , the practice of religion slowly increased . It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990 , an action which was occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 . The government implemented reforms which were aimed at modernizing Albania and they resulted in significant gains in the areas of industry , agriculture , education , the arts , and culture , which contributed to a general increase in the Albanian population 's standard of living . However , these developments coincided with political repression by the secret police , the Sigurimi , for the purposes of preventing a counter-revolution , which included dismissal from employment , imprisonment in forced labor camps and executions .

Born in Gjirokast\u00ebr in 1908 , Hoxha became a teacher in grammar school in 1936 . Following Italy 's invasion of Albania , he joined the Party of Labour of Albania at its creation in 1941 . Hoxha was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34 . The Yugoslav Partisans assisted the Albanians .

However , detractors criticize him for a series of political repressions which included the establishment and use of forced labor camps , extrajudicial killings and executions that targeted and eliminated dissidents , a large number of which was carried out by the Sigurimi secret police .

The state considered itself the heir to the Republic of Councils in Hungary , which was formed in 1919 as the first communist state created after the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . It was designated a people 's democratic republic by the Soviet Union in the 1940s . Geographically , it bordered Romania and the Soviet Union ( via the Ukrainian SSR ) to the east ; Yugoslavia to the southwest ; Czechoslovakia to the north and Austria to the west . Having emasculated most of the other parties , the Communists spent the next year and a half consolidating their hold on power . This culminated in October 1947 , when the Communists told their non-Communist coalition partners that they had to cooperate with a reconfigured coalition government if they wanted to stay in the country . In June 1948 the Communists forced the Social Democrats to merge with them to form the Hungarian Working People 's Party ( MDP ) . However , the few independent-minded Social Democrats were quickly shunted aside , leaving the MDP as a renamed and enlarged Communist Party .

The country was a Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc state with a dominant role for the Romanian Communist Party enshrined in its constitutions . As World War II ended , Romania , a former Axis member , was occupied by the Soviet Union , the sole representative of the Allies . On 6 March 1945 , after mass demonstrations by communist sympathizers and political pressure from the Soviet representative of the Allied Control Commission , a new pro-Soviet government that included members of the previously outlawed Romanian Workers ' Party was installed . Gradually , more members of the Workers ' Party and communist-aligned parties gained control of the administration and pre-war political leaders were steadily eliminated from political life . In December 1947 , King Michael was coerced to abdicate and the People 's Republic of Romania was declared . At first , Romania 's scarce post-war resources were drained by the SovRoms , new tax-exempt Soviet-Romanian companies that allowed the Soviet Union to control Romania 's major sources of income . Another drain was the war reparations paid to the Soviet Union . In the 1950s , however , Romania 's communist government began to assert more independence , inducing , for example , the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Romania by 1958 . In the 1960s and 1970s , Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu became General Secretary of the Communist Party ( 1965 ) , Chairman of the State Council ( 1967 ) and assumed the newly established role of President in 1974 .

Upon his rise to power , he eased press censorship and openly condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in his speech on 21 August 1968 , which resulted in a surge in popularity . However , the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely totalitarian and was considered the most repressive in the Eastern Bloc at the time . His secret police , the Securitate , was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country and he suppressed and controlled the media and press , implementing methods that were among the harshest , most restrictive and brutal in the world . Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania . In 1982 , he exported much of the country 's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them . The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards , leading to heavy rationing of food , water , oil , heat , electricity , medicine and other necessities . His cult of personality experienced unprecedented elevation , followed by extensive nepotism and the intense deterioration of foreign relations , even with the Soviet Union .",

In addition , it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia : Kosovo and Vojvodina . The SFRY 's origin is traced to 26 November 1942 , when the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia was formed during World War II . On 29 November 1945 , the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed after the deposition of King Peter II , thus ending the monarchy . Until 1948 , the new communist government originally sided with the Eastern Bloc under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito at the beginning of the Cold War , but after the Tito-Stalin split of 1948 , Yugoslavia pursued a policy of neutrality . It became one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement , and transitioned from a command economy to market-based socialism . The SFRY maintained neutrality during the Cold War as part of its foreign policy . It was a founding member of CERN , the United Nations , Non-Aligned Movement , OSCE , IFAD , WTO , Eutelsat , and BTWC . Following the death of Tito on 4 May 1980 , the Yugoslav economy started to collapse , which increased unemployment and inflation .
