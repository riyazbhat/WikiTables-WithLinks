  "/wiki/College_Fjord": "College Fjord is a fjord located in the northern sector of Prince William Sound in the U.S. state of Alaska . The fjord contains five tidewater glaciers ( glaciers that terminate in water ) , five large valley glaciers , and dozens of smaller glaciers , most named after renowned East Coast colleges ( women 's colleges for the NW side , and men 's colleges for the SE side ) . College Fjord was discovered in 1899 during the Harriman Expedition , at which time the glaciers were named . The expedition included a Harvard and an Amherst professor , and they named many of the glaciers after elite colleges . According to Bruce Molina , author of Alaska 's Glaciers , They took great delight in ignoring Princeton",

An exclave of the U.S. , it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast has a maritime border with Russia 's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west . To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean , while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest . Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world . It is the third least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continent 's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015 - more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland . Approximately half of Alaska 's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area . The state capital of Juneau is the second largest city in the United States by area , comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware . Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans . The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing the colony of Alaska that spanned most of the current state . The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for $ 7.2 million , or approximately two cents per acre ( $ 4.74/km2 ) . The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11 , 1912",
