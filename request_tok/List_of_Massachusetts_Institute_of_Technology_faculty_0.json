  "/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences": "The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics , is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics , and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field . The award 's official name is The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ( Swedish : Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne ) . The prize was established in 1968 by a donation from Sweden 's central bank Sveriges Riksbank to the Nobel Foundation to commemorate the bank 's 300th anniversary . As it is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895 , it is not technically a Nobel Prize . However , it is administered and referred to along with the Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation . Laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates , and receive the award at the same ceremony . Laureates in the Memorial Prize in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . It was first awarded in 1969 to Dutch and Norwegian economists Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch , for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes",
  "/wiki/Search_theory": "In microeconomics , search theory studies buyers or sellers who can not instantly find a trading partner , and must therefore search for a partner prior to transacting . Search theory has been influential in many areas of economics . It has been applied in labor economics to analyze frictional unemployment resulting from job hunting by workers . In consumer theory , it has been applied to analyze purchasing decisions . From a worker 's perspective , an acceptable job would be one that pays a high wage , one that offers desirable benefits , and/or one that offers pleasant and safe working conditions . From a consumer 's perspective , a product worth purchasing would have sufficiently high quality , and be offered at a sufficiently low price . In both cases , whether a given job or product is acceptable depends on the searcher 's beliefs about the alternatives available in the market . More precisely , search theory studies an individual 's optimal strategy when choosing from a series of potential opportunities of random quality , under the assumption that delaying choice is costly . Search models illustrate how best to balance the cost of delay against the value of the option to try again . Mathematically , search models are optimal stopping problems . Macroeconomists have extended search theory by studying general equilibrium models in which one or more types of searchers interact . These macroeconomic theories have been called 'matching theory ' , or 'search and matching theory '",

  "/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded yearly by the Nobel Foundation for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial .

  "/wiki/Bose\u2013Einstein_condensation": "A Bose-Einstein condensate ( BEC ) is a state of matter ( also called the fifth state of matter ) which is typically formed when a gas of bosons at low densities is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero ( -273.15 \u00b0C ) . Under such conditions , a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state , at which point microscopic quantum phenomena , particularly wavefunction interference , become apparent macroscopically . A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density , about one-hundred-thousandth ( 1/100,000 ) the density of normal air , to ultra-low temperatures . This state was first predicted , generally , in 1924-1925 by Albert Einstein following a paper written by Satyendra Nath Bose , although Bose came up with the pioneering paper on the new statistics",

He shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Richard J. Roberts for the discovery that genes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns , and that the splicing of messenger RNA to delete those introns can occur in different ways , yielding different proteins from the same DNA sequence . He has been selected to receive the 2015 Othmer Gold Medal",
  "/wiki/Split_genes": "An interrupted gene ( also called a split gene ) is a gene that contains sections of DNA called exons , which are expressed as RNA and protein , interrupted by sections of DNA called introns , which are not expressed . The DNA sequence in the exon provides instructions for coding proteins . The function of the intron was not understood at first , and they were called noncoding or junk DNA . Split genes were independently discovered by Richard J. Roberts and Phillip A . Sharp in 1977 , for which they shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Their discovery implied the existence of then-unknown machinery for splicing out introns and assembling genes ; namely , the spliceosome . It was soon accepted that 94 % of human genes are interrupted , and 50 % of hereditary diseases are involved in splicing intron errors out of interrupted genes . The best known example of a disease caused by a splicing error is Beta-thalassemia , in which extra intronic material is erroneously spliced into the gene for making hemoglobin . Lower eukaryotes , including yeast , have many uninterrupted regions , as they contain long stretches of exons that create the mRNA necessary for the synthesis of proteins . This does not mean , however , that these sections are fully uninterrupted , as tRNA synthesis requires excision of a nucleotide sequence , followed by ligation . Most bacteria have some interruption of some genes . Interrupted genes are universal in eukaryotes ; yeasts may display single interruptions of a minority of genes , while in higher organisms most genes are interrupted",

  "/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom": "In particle physics , asymptotic freedom is a property of some gauge theories that causes interactions between particles to become asymptotically weaker as the energy scale increases and the corresponding length scale decreases . Asymptotic freedom is a feature of quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) , the quantum field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons , the fundamental constituents of nuclear matter . Quarks interact weakly at high energies , allowing perturbative calculations . At low energies the interaction becomes strong , leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within composite hadrons . The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek , and independently by David Politzer in the same year . For this work all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics",
