  "/wiki/Least_Concern": "A least concern species is a species that has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as evaluated as not being a focus of species conservation . They do not qualify as threatened , near threatened , or ( before 2001 ) conservation dependent . Species can not be assigned the Least Concern category unless they have had their population status evaluated . That is , adequate information is needed to make a direct , or indirect , assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution or population status . Since 2001 the category has had the abbreviation LC , following the IUCN 2001 Categories & Criteria ( version 3.1 ) . However , around 20% of least concern taxa ( 3261 of 15636 ) in the IUCN database use the code LR/lc , which indicates they have not been re-evaluated since 2000 . Before 2001 least concern was a subcategory of the Lower Risk category and assigned the code LR/lc or lc . While least concern is not considered a red listed category by the IUCN , the 2006 IUCN Red List still assigns the category to 15636 taxa . The number of animal species listed in this category totals 14033 ( which includes several undescribed species such as a frog from the genus Philautus ) . There are also 101 animal subspecies listed and 1500 plant taxa ( 1410 species , 55 subspecies , and 35 varieties ) . There are also two animal subpopulations listed : the Australasian and Southern African subpopulations of spiny dogfish . No fungi or protista have the classification , though only four species in those kingdoms have been evaluated by the IUCN .",

  "/wiki/Local_extinction": "Local extinction or extirpation is the condition of a species ( or other taxon ) that ceases to exist in the chosen geographic area of study , though it still exists elsewhere . Local extinctions are contrasted with global extinctions . Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations ; wolf reintroduction is an example of this .",

  "/wiki/Diadophis_punctatus": "Diadophis punctatus , commonly known as the ring-necked snake or ringneck snake , is a harmless species of colubrid snake found throughout much of the United States , central Mexico , and southeastern Canada . Ring-necked snakes are secretive , nocturnal snakes , so are rarely seen during the day time . They are slightly venomous , but their nonaggressive nature and small , rear-facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them . They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails , exposing their bright red-orange posterior , ventral surface when threatened . Ring-necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range , though no scientific evaluation supports this hypothesis . Scientific research is lacking for the ring-necked snake , and more in-depth investigations are greatly needed . It is the only species within the genus Diadophis , and currently 14 subspecies are identified , but many herpetologists question the morphologically based classifications .",
