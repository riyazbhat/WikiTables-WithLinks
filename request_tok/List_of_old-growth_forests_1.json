  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi )",

  "/wiki/Western_Australia": "Western Australia [ a ] ( abbreviated as WA ) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia . It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west , and the Southern Ocean to the south , [ b ] the Northern Territory to the north-east , and South Australia to the south-east . Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres ( 976,790 sq mi ) , and the second-largest country subdivision in the world , surpassed only by Russia 's Sakha Republic . The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants - around 11 percent of the national total - of whom the vast majority ( 92 per cent ) live in the south-west corner , 79 per cent of the population living in the Perth area , leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated . The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 .

  "/wiki/Subtropical": "The subtropics are geographic and climate zones located roughly between the tropics at latitude 23.5\u00b0 ( the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn ) and temperate zones ( normally referring to latitudes 35-66.5\u00b0 ) north and south of the Equator . Subtropical climates are often characterized by hot summers and mild winters with infrequent frost . Most subtropical climates fall into two basic types : humid subtropical , where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months ( e.g . South China and the northeastern Southern Cone ) , and dry summer or Mediterranean climate , where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months ( e.g . the Mediterranean Basin and the west coast of the continental United States ) . Subtropical climates can occur at high elevations within the tropics , such as in the southern end of the Mexican Plateau and in the Vietnamese Highlands . Six climate classifications use the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for the planet Earth . A great portion of the world 's deserts are located within the subtropics , due to the development of the subtropical ridge . Areas bordering warm oceans ( typically on the southeast sides of continents ) are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones , which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall . Areas bordering cool oceans ( typically on the southwest sides of continents ) are prone to fog , aridity , and dry summers . Plants such as palms , citrus , mango , pistachio , lychee , and avocado are grown in the subtropics",
  "/wiki/Temperate": "In geography , the temperate or tepid climates of Earth occur in the middle latitudes , which span between the tropics and the polar regions of Earth . In most climate classifications , temperate climates refer to the climate zone between 35 and 50 north and south latitudes ( between the subarctic and subtropical climates ) . These zones generally have wider temperature ranges throughout the year and more distinct seasonal changes compared to tropical climates , where such variations are often small . They typically feature four distinct seasons , Summer the warmest , Autumn the transitioning season to Winter , the colder season , and Spring the transitioning season from winter back into summer . In the northern hemisphere , the year starts with winter , transitions in the first half year through spring into summer , which is in mid-year , then at the second half year through autumn into winter at year-end . In the southern hemisphere , the seasons are swapped , with summer between years and winter in mid-year . The temperate zones ( latitudes from 23.5\u00b0 to the polar circles at about 66.5\u00b0 , north and south ) are where the widest seasonal changes occur , with most climates found in it having some influence from both the tropics and the poles . The subtropics ( latitudes from about 23.5\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 , north and south ) have temperate climates that have the least seasonal change and the warmest in winter , while at the other end , Boreal climates located from 55 to 65 north latitude have the most seasonal changes and long and severe winters . In temperate climates , not only do latitudinal positions influence temperature changes , but sea currents , prevailing wind direction , continentality ( how large a landmass is ) , and altitude also shape temperate climates . The K\u00f6ppen climate classification defines a climate as temperate when the mean temperature is above \u22123 \u00b0C ( 26.6 \u00b0F ) but below 18 \u00b0C ( 64.4 \u00b0F ) in the coldest month .

Estimates vary from 40 % to 75 % of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests . There may be many millions of species of plants , insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests . Tropical rainforests have been called the jewels of the Earth and the world 's largest pharmacy , because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there . Rainforests are also responsible for 28 % of the world 's oxygen turnover , sometimes misnamed oxygen production , processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration . The undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level . If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned , the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense , tangled growth of vines , shrubs and small trees , called a jungle . The term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally .

It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42 % of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers",

Tasmanian rainforest is classified and as cool temperate rainforest , it represents the most floristically complex and best developed form of this forest type in Australia . In Tasmania , they can be found in the West , Savage River National Park , South West , North East and in patches on the East Coast . On the mainland of Australia , cool temperate rainforest have a wide variety of woodland trees , but Tasmania only has a limited number of woodland and vascular plants such as mosses , liverworts , lichen and fungi . Because of this , the definition of Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest was redefined in the 1980s to allow for communities that did not meet the canopy requirements and clearly separate cool temperate rainforest from mixed forest ; The current definition states that cool temperate rainforests are those with trees usually greater than 8 m ( 26 ft ) in height and capable of regenerating in the absence of large scale catastrophic events , such as fire . These forests are climax vegetation and are dominated by angiosperms such as Nothofagus cunninghamii ( myrtle beech ) , Atherosperma moschatum ( sassafras ) , and Eucryphia lucida ( leatherwood ) as well as gymnosperms such as Athrotaxis selaginoides ( King Billy Pine ) , Lagarostrobos franklinii ( huon or macquarie pine ) and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius ( celery-top pine ) . The limited number of woody species is thought to be due to repeated glaciation .

Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 .

If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned , the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense , tangled growth of vines , shrubs and small trees , called a jungle . The term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally . Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation , the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere"
