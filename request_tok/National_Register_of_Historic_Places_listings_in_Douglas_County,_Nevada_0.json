While Hawkins anticipated that Douglas County would need a modern hospital for its growing population , the county 's population actually fell at the 1920 census , and the community struggled to keep its hospital open .

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 29 , 1979",
  "/wiki/U.S._Route_395": "U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) is a U.S. Route in the western United States . The southern terminus of the route is in the Mojave Desert at Interstate 15 near Hesperia . The northern terminus is at the Canada-US border near Laurier , where the road becomes Highway 395 upon entering British Columbia , Canada . Before 1964 , the route extended south to San Diego .

Old Highway 395 can be seen along or near I-15 in many locations before it branches off at Hesperia to head north . The route runs through the U.S. states of California , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington . US 395 runs along the Eastern Sierra in the Owens Valley and crosses through the Modoc Plateau along its routing . The route started out as a spur of U.S. Route 195 and ran north from Spokane . As a result , the route never intersects its parent , U.S. Route 95 ; it maintains a connection through US 195 . US 395 developed into a parallel of its parent route when extended south in the early 1930s . US 395 stays west of its parent route , which runs through Arizona , California , Nevada , Oregon and Idaho",

The Nevada portion crosses the center of the state and was named The Loneliest Road in America by Life magazine in July 1986 .

US 50 has a diverse route through the state , traversing the resort communities of Lake Tahoe , the state capital in Carson City , historical sites such as Fort Churchill State Historic Park , petroglyphs , alpine forests , desert valleys , ghost towns , and Great Basin National Park .

Prior to 1910 , the only county jail was in Genoa , the county seat ; however , since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa , it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge 's granary . As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners , the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail . However , local leaders in Minden , who wanted to move the county seat to their town , protested the move , as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself . Nonetheless , the county approved the construction of the new jail . The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished , as the Genoa jail burned down ; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him . Once completed , the jail served the county until 1915 , when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail . Once it no longer served as the county jail , the Gardnerville jail took on another , racially charged purpose . Gardnerville was a sundown town , and it rang a bell every night to order American Indians out of town .
