The original console in the series was the first console of any type to ship over 100 million units , doing so in under a decade . Its successor , the PlayStation 2 , was released in 2000 . The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date , having reached over 155 million units sold by the end of 2012 . Sony 's next console , the PlayStation 3 , was released in 2006 , selling over 87.4 million units by March 2017 . Sony 's latest console , the PlayStation 4 , was released in 2013 , selling a million units within a day , becoming the fastest selling console in history . The next console in the series , the PlayStation 5 , is expected to be released by the end of 2020 .

  "/wiki/Sega_Saturn": "The Sega Saturn [ a ] [ b ] is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe . The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",

Also , his success at the restrictor plate tracks of Daytona and Talladega earned him the nickname , Mr. Restrictor Plate . In February 2001 , Earnhardt died due to injuries sustained in a collision during the final lap of the Daytona 500 , an event that was widely lamented in the racing industry .

It is slightly thicker and taller and features a slightly smaller screen than the Game Boy Pocket , its immediate predecessor in the Game Boy line . As with the original Game Boy , it has a custom 8-bit processor made by Sharp that is considered a hybrid between the Intel 8080 and the Zilog Z80 .

The Game Boy Color is part of the fifth generation of video game consoles . The GBC 's primary competitors in Japan were the grayscale 16-bit handhelds , Neo Geo Pocket and the WonderSwan , though the Game Boy Color outsold them by a wide margin . SNK and Bandai countered with the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the Wonderswan Color , respectively , but this did little to change Nintendo 's sales dominance . With Sega discontinuing the Game Gear in 1997 , the Game Boy Color 's only competitor in the United States was its predecessor , the Game Boy , until the short-lived Neo Geo Pocket Color was released in August 1999 .

  "/wiki/Personal_Computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",

Announced in 2000 , the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals , featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor , a processor that could be found on a standard PC . It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight , and was the first console to feature a built-in hard disk . In November 2002 , Microsoft launched Xbox Live , a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection . Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",

Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003 , and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11 , 2004 . The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced , and was the first real competitor of Nintendo 's handheld consoles after many challengers , such as SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia 's N-Gage , had failed .
