The results of both the men 's and ladies ' singles events were dominated by placements in the compulsory figures , which at the time were nominally worth 50 % of the total score but in fact weighted more heavily than the free skating due to being judged using a wider range of marks . In the men 's event , Ondrej Nepela , the figures winner , took the gold in spite of placing only 4th in the free skating after falling on his triple loop jump . The free skating winner was Sergei Chetverukhin , who skated one of his best performances at this event to take the silver medal . Patrick P\u00e9ra , second in the figures , had a poor free skating in which he fell on a triple salchow jump early in his program and then made other mistakes . Nonetheless the weight given to figures allowed him to take the bronze medal ahead of John Misha Petkevich , Kenneth Shelley , and Toller Cranston , who all skated dynamic programs with at least one cleanly landed triple jump apiece . The effect of the figures was even more pronounced in the ladies ' competition , where gold medal winner Beatrix Schuba placed only 7th in the free skating , performing mostly single jumps . The free skating was won by Janet Lynn , who received a perfect mark of 6.0 despite falling on a flying sit spin . Lynn 's skating captivated the Japanese audience , especially when she got up smiling from her fall .
