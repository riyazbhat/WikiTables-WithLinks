  "/wiki/Methamphetamine": "Methamphetamine [ note 1 ] ( contracted from N-methylamphetamine ) is a potent central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity . Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers : levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine . [ note 2 ] Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms . It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant , among other concerns , as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy . Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine . Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use . The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia , Oceania , and in the United States , where racemic methamphetamine , levomethamphetamine , and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances . Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter ( OTC ) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States . [ note 3 ] Internationally , the production , distribution , sale , and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries , due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty . While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug , racemic methamphetamine is sometimes illicitly produced due to the relative ease of synthesis and limited availability of chemical precursors . In low to moderate doses , methamphetamine can elevate mood , increase alertness , concentration and energy in fatigued individuals , reduce appetite , and promote weight loss . At very high doses , it can induce psychosis , breakdown of skeletal muscle , seizures and bleeding in the brain .",
  "/wiki/Cocaine": "Cocaine , also known as coke , is a strong stimulant most frequently used as a recreational drug . It is commonly snorted , inhaled as smoke , or dissolved and injected into a vein . Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality , an intense feeling of happiness , or agitation . Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate , sweating , and large pupils . High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature . Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes . Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery . Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain . After a short period of use , there is a high risk that dependence will occur . Its use also increases the risk of stroke , myocardial infarction , lung problems in those who smoke it , blood infections , and sudden cardiac death . Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics , cornstarch , quinine , or sugar , which can result in additional toxicity . Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired .",
