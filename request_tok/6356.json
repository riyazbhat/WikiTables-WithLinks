  "/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan": "Thomas Hunt Morgan ( September 25 , 1866 - December 4 , 1945 ) was an American evolutionary biologist , geneticist , embryologist , and science author who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933 for discoveries elucidating the role that the chromosome plays in heredity . Morgan received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in zoology in 1890 and researched embryology during his tenure at Bryn Mawr . Following the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900 , Morgan began to study the genetic characteristics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . In his famous Fly Room at Columbia University , Morgan demonstrated that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity . These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics . During his distinguished career , Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers . As a result of his work , Drosophila became a major model organism in contemporary genetics . The Division of Biology which he established at the California Institute of Technology has produced seven Nobel Prize winners .",
  "/wiki/Chromosome": "A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) molecule with part or all of the genetic material ( genome ) of an organism . Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which , aided by chaperone proteins , bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle . This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation . Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) . Before this happens , every chromosome is copied once ( S phase ) , and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere , resulting either in an X-shaped structure ( pictured here ) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends . The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids . During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome . In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study . In animal cells , chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation . Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity . If these structures are manipulated incorrectly , through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation , the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe . Usually , this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death , but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer .",
  "/wiki/Heredity": "Heredity , also called inheritance or biological inheritance , is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring ; either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction , the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents . Through heredity , variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by natural selection . The study of heredity in biology is genetics .",

Murphy was born on February 6 , 1892 , at Stoughton , Wisconsin and moved to Condon , Oregon as a youth . He was educated at the public schools of Wisconsin and Oregon . He completed his A.B . degree in 1914 from the University of Oregon . He completed his M.D . in 1922 from Harvard Medical School . In 1924 , Murphy bled dogs to make them anemic ( work inspired by war injury work ) , and then fed them various substances to gauge their improvement . He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to restore anemia more quickly of all foods . Minot and Whipple then set about to chemically isolate the curative substance . These investigations showed that iron in the liver was responsible for curing anemia from bleeding , but meanwhile liver had been tried on people with pernicious anemia and some effect as seen there , also . The active ingredient in this case , found serendipitously , was not iron , but rather a water-soluble extract containing a new substance .",
  "/wiki/Liver": "The liver is an organ only found in vertebrates which detoxifies various metabolites , synthesizes proteins and produces biochemicals necessary for digestion and growth . In humans , it is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen , below the diaphragm . Its other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage , decomposition of red blood cells and the production of hormones . The liver is an accessory digestive organ that produces bile , a fluid containing cholesterol and bile acids , and an alkaline compound which helps the breakdown of fat . Bile aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids . The gallbladder , a small pouch that sits just under the liver , stores bile produced by the liver which is afterwards moved to the small intestine to complete digestion . The liver 's highly specialized tissue consisting of mostly hepatocytes regulates a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions , including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules , many of which are necessary for normal vital functions . Estimates regarding the organ 's total number of functions vary , but textbooks generally cite it being around 500 . Terminology related to the liver often starts in hepat- from \u1f21\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf- , from the Greek word for liver . It is not yet known how to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term , although liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term . Artificial livers are yet to be developed to promote long-term replacement in the absence of the liver . As of 2018 [ update ] , liver transplantation is the only option for complete liver failure .",
  "/wiki/Anaemia": "Anemia ( also spelled anaemia ) is a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells ( RBCs ) or hemoglobin in the blood , or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen . When anemia comes on slowly , the symptoms are often vague and may include feeling tired , weakness , shortness of breath , and a poor ability to exercise . When the anemia comes on quickly , symptoms may include confusion , feeling like one is going to pass out , loss of consciousness , and increased thirst . Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale . Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause . Anemia can be caused by blood loss , decreased red blood cell production , and increased red blood cell breakdown . Causes of blood loss include trauma and gastrointestinal bleeding . Causes of decreased production include iron deficiency , vitamin B12 deficiency , thalassemia , and a number of neoplasms of the bone marrow . Causes of increased breakdown include genetic conditions such as sickle cell anemia , infections such as malaria , and certain autoimmune diseases . Anemia can also be classified based on the size of the red blood cells and amount of hemoglobin in each cell . If the cells are small , it is called microcytic anemia ; if they are large , it is called macrocytic anemia ; and if they are normal sized , it is called normocytic anemia . The diagnosis of anemia in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L ( 13 to 14 g/dL ) ; in women , it is less than 120 to 130 g/L ( 12 to 13 g/dL ) .",

  "/wiki/Nerve_fibre": "An axon ( from Greek \u1f04\u03be\u03c9\u03bd \u00e1x\u014dn , axis ) , or nerve fiber ( or nerve fibre : see spelling differences ) , is a long , slender projection of a nerve cell , or neuron , in vertebrates , that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body . The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons , muscles , and glands . In certain sensory neurons ( pseudounipolar neurons ) , such as those for touch and warmth , the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body , and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon . Axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons . Nerve fibers are classed into three types - group A nerve fibers , group B nerve fibers , and group C nerve fibers . Groups A and B are myelinated , and group C are unmyelinated . These groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers . Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I , Type II , Type III , and Type IV . An axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron ; the other type is a dendrite . Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features , including shape ( dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius ) , length ( dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer ) , and function ( dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them ) . Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites . In some species , axons can emanate from dendrites known as axon-carrying dendrites .",

  "/wiki/Tumour": "A neoplasm ( /\u02c8ni\u02d0o\u028apl\u00e6z\u0259m , \u02c8ni\u0259-/ ) is a type of abnormal and excessive growth , called neoplasia , of tissue . The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue , and it persists growing abnormally , even if the original trigger is removed . This abnormal growth usually ( but not always ) forms a mass . When it forms a mass , it may be called a tumor . ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups : benign neoplasms , in situ neoplasms , malignant neoplasms , and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior . Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers and are the focus of oncology . Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue , as neoplasia , cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth , such as metaplasia or dysplasia . However , metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia .

Since Dmitri Ivanovsky 's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants , and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898 , about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail , although there are millions of types . Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity . The study of viruses is known as virology , a sub-speciality of microbiology . While not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell , viruses exist in the form of independent particles , or virions , consisting of : ( i ) the genetic material , i.e . long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts ; ( ii ) a protein coat , the capsid , which surrounds and protects the genetic material ; and in some cases ( iii ) an outside envelope of lipids . The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some species to more complex structures for others . Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope , about one hundredth the size of most bacteria . The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear : some may have evolved from plasmids - pieces of DNA that can move between cells - while others may have evolved from bacteria . In evolution , viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer , which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction . Viruses are considered by some to be a life form , because they carry genetic material , reproduce , and evolve through natural selection , although they lack key characteristics ( such as cell structure ) that are generally considered necessary to count as life .",

  "/wiki/Restriction_enzyme": "A restriction enzyme , restriction endonuclease , or restrictase is an enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within molecules known as restriction sites . Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader endonuclease group of enzymes . Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types , which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site , or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another . To cut DNA , all restriction enzymes make two incisions , once through each sugar-phosphate backbone ( i.e . each strand ) of the DNA double helix . These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and provide a defence mechanism against invading viruses . Inside a prokaryote , the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction digestion ; meanwhile , host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme ( a methyltransferase ) that modifies the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage . Together , these two processes form the restriction modification system . Over 3,000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail , and more than 600 of these are available commercially . These enzymes are routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories , and they are a vital tool in molecular cloning .",

  "/wiki/G-protein": "G proteins , also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins , are a family of proteins that act as molecular switches inside cells , and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a cell to its interior . Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) to guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) . When they are bound to GTP , they are 'on ' , and , when they are bound to GDP , they are 'off ' . G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called GTPases . There are two classes of G proteins . The first function as monomeric small GTPases ( small G-proteins ) , while the second function as heterotrimeric G protein complexes . The latter class of complexes is made up of alpha ( \u03b1 ) , beta ( \u03b2 ) and gamma ( \u03b3 ) subunits . In addition , the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the beta-gamma complex . Heterotrimeric G proteins located within the cell are activated by G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) that span the cell membrane . Signaling molecules bind to a domain of the GPCR located outside the cell , and an intracellular GPCR domain then in turn activates a particular G protein . Some active-state GPCRs have also been shown to be pre-coupled with G proteins . The G protein activates a cascade of further signaling events that finally results in a change in cell function .",
  "/wiki/Signal_transduction": "Signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events , most commonly protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases , which ultimately results in a cellular response . Proteins responsible for detecting stimuli are generally termed receptors , although in some cases the term sensor is used . The changes elicited by ligand binding ( or signal sensing ) in a receptor give rise to a biochemical cascade , which is a chain of biochemical events known as a signaling pathway . When signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks , which allow cellular responses to be coordinated , often by combinatorial signaling events . At the molecular level , such responses include changes in the transcription or translation of genes , and post-translational and conformational changes in proteins , as well as changes in their location . These molecular events are the basic mechanisms controlling cell growth , proliferation , metabolism and many other processes . In multicellular organisms , signal transduction pathways have evolved to regulate cell communication in a wide variety of ways . Each component ( or node ) of a signaling pathway is classified according to the role it plays with respect to the initial stimulus . Ligands are termed first messengers , while receptors are the signal transducers , which then activate primary effectors . Such effectors are often linked to second messengers , which can activate secondary effectors , and so on . Depending on the efficiency of the nodes , a signal can be amplified ( a concept known as signal gain ) , so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules . As with other signals , the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay , noise , signal feedback and feedforward and interference , which can range from negligible to pathological .",

Two types of small ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) molecules - microRNA ( miRNA ) and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - are central to RNA interference . RNAs are the direct products of genes , and these small RNAs can direct enzyme complexes to degrade messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules and thus decrease their activity by preventing translation , via post-transcriptional gene silencing . Moreover , transcription can be inhibited via the pre-transcriptional silencing mechanism of RNA interference , through which an enzyme complex catalyzes DNA methylation at genomic positions complementary to complexed siRNA or miRNA . RNA interference has an important role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences - viruses and transposons . It also influences development .",
