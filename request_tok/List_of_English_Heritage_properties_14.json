  "/wiki/Megalithic_tomb": "A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument , either alone or together with other stones . The adjective megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar [ citation needed ] or concrete , as well as the periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions . There are over 35,000 megaliths in Europe alone , ranging from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 ( transliteration m\u00e9gas , meaning great ) and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( transliteration l\u00edthos meaning stone ) .

  "/wiki/Neolithic": "The Neolithic ( /\u02ccni\u02d0o\u028a\u02c8l\u026a\u03b8\u026ak/ ( listen ) , also known as the New Stone Age ) , the final division of the Stone Age , began about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East , and later in other parts of the world . The division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago ( 4500 BC ) , marked by the development of metallurgy , leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age . In Northern Europe , the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC , while in China it extended until 1200 BC . Other parts of the world ( including the New World ) remained broadly in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact . The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes , including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals . [ a ] The term Neolithic derives from the Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 n\u00e9os , new and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00edthos , stone , literally meaning New Stone Age . The term was coined by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-age system",

  "/wiki/Roman_amphitheatre": "Roman amphitheatres are amphitheatres - large , circular or oval open-air venues with raised seating - built by the ancient Romans . They were used for events such as gladiator combats , venationes ( animal slayings ) and executions . About 230 Roman amphitheatres have been found across the area of the Roman Empire . Early amphitheatres date from the republican period , though they became more monumental during the imperial era . Amphitheatres are distinguished from circuses , hippodromes , which were usually rectangular and built mainly for racing events and stadia , built for athletics . But several of these terms have at times been used for one and the same venue . The word amphitheatrum means theatre all around . Thus an amphitheatre is distinguished from the traditional semicircular Roman theatres by being circular or oval in shape",

  "/wiki/Church_(building)": "A church building or church house , often simply called a church , is a building used for Christian religious activities , particularly for Christian worship services . The term is often used by Christians to refer to the physical buildings where they worship , but it is sometimes used ( by analogy ) to refer to buildings of other religions . In traditional Christian architecture , a church interior is often structured in the shape of a Christian cross . When viewed from plan view the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center aisle and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the bema and altar . Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the heavens and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers . Modern church buildings have a variety of architectural styles and layouts ; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use , and , conversely , many original church buildings have been put to other uses . The earliest identified Christian church building was a house church founded between 233 and 256 . From the 11th through the 14th centuries , a wave of building of cathedrals and smaller parish churches were erected across Western Europe . A cathedral is a church building , usually Roman Catholic , Protestant ( including Anglican ) , Eastern Orthodox , or Oriental Orthodox , housing a cathedra , the formal name for the seat or throne of a presiding bishop",

  "/wiki/Abbey": "An abbey is a complex of buildings , a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess . It provides a place for religious activities , work , and housing of Christian monks and nuns . The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them . Religious life in an abbey may be monastic . An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors . The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order . Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy , refuge to the persecuted , or education to the young . Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat . There are many famous abbeys across Europe",

  "/wiki/Offa's_Dyke": "The generally accepted theory about much of the earthwork attributes its construction to Offa , King of Mercia from 757 to 796 . The structure did not represent a mutually agreed boundary between the Mercians and the Kingdom of Powys . It had a ditch on the Welsh ( western ) side , with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian ( eastern ) side . This suggests that Mercians constructed it as a defensive earthwork , or to demonstrate the power and intent of their kingdom . Throughout its entire length , the Dyke provides an uninterrupted view from Mercia into Wales . Where the earthwork encounters hills or high ground , it passes to the west of them . Although historians often overlook Offa 's reign due to limitations in source material , he ranks as one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon rulers - as evidenced in his ability to raise the workforce and resources required to construct Offa 's Dyke . The construction of the earthwork probably involved a corv\u00e9e system requiring vassals to build certain lengths of the earthwork for Offa in addition to the normal services that they provided to their king . The Tribal Hidage , a primary document , shows the distribution of land within 8th-century Britain ; it shows that peoples were located within specified territories for administration",

  "/wiki/St_Briavels_Castle": "St Briavels Castle is a moated Norman castle at St Briavels in the English county of Gloucestershire . The castle is noted for its huge Edwardian gatehouse that guards the entrance . St Briavels Castle was originally built between 1075 and 1129 as a royal administrative centre for the Forest of Dean . During the 13th century the castle became first a favourite hunting lodge of King John , and then the primary centre in England for the manufacture of quarrels , large numbers of which were required for crossbows in medieval warfare . The castle was transferred many times between royal favourites in the 14th and 15th centuries and slowly declined in appearance and importance . St Briavels Castle became used primarily as a court and as a notorious debtors ' prison , conditions being documented by the prison reformer John Howard in 1775 . Following local riots and a parliamentary investigation in the 1830s , reforms in the 19th century brought an end to the castle 's use as a prison . Extensive renovation at the turn of the 20th century allowed St Briavels Castle to be taken over as a Youth Hostel in 1948 . It remains in this role today , owned by English Heritage and open to the public . The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument",
  "/wiki/Castle": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders . Scholars debate the scope of the word castle , but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble . This is distinct from a palace , which is not fortified ; from a fortress , which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility ; and from a fortified settlement , which was a public defence - though there are many similarities among these types of construction . Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses . Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built , they took on a great many forms with many different features , although some , such as curtain walls , arrowslits , and portcullises , were commonplace . European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries , after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes . These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures ; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies . Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies , the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power . Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes , and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community , such as mills , fertile land , or a water source . Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber , but had their defences replaced later by stone . Early castles often exploited natural defences , lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep . In the late 12th and early 13th centuries , a scientific approach to castle defence emerged",
