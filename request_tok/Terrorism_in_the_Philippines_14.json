Car bombs can be roughly divided into two main categories : those used primarily to kill the occupants of the vehicle ( often as an assassination ) and those used as a means to kill , injure or damage people and buildings outside the vehicle . The latter type may be either parked ( the vehicle disguising the bomb and allowing the bomber to get away ) or the vehicle might be used to deliver the bomb ( often as part of a suicide bombing ) . It is commonly used as a weapon of terrorism or guerrilla warfare to kill people near the blast site or to damage buildings or other property . Car bombs act as their own delivery mechanisms and can carry a relatively large amount of explosives without attracting suspicion ; in larger vehicles and trucks , weights of around 7,000 pounds ( 3,200 kg ) or more have been used , for example , in the Oklahoma City bombing . Car bombs are activated in a variety of ways , including opening the vehicle 's doors , starting the engine , depressing the accelerator or brake pedals or simply lighting a fuse or setting a timing device . The gasoline in the vehicle 's fuel tank may make the explosion of the bomb more powerful by dispersing and igniting the fuel"
