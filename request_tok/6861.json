  "/wiki/Ankh": "The ankh is an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol that was most commonly used in writing and in Egyptian art to represent the word for life and , by extension , as a symbol of life itself . The ankh has a cross shape but with an oval loop in place of an upper bar . The origins of the symbol are not known , although many hypotheses have been proposed . It was used in writing as a triliteral sign , representing a sequence of three consonants , \ua724-n-\u1e2b . This sequence was found in several Egyptian words , including the words meaning mirror , floral bouquet , and life . In art the symbol often appeared as a physical object representing either life or substances such as air or water that are related to it . It was especially commonly held in the hands of ancient Egyptian deities , or being given by them to the pharaoh , to represent their power to sustain life and to revive human souls in the afterlife . The ankh was one of the most common decorative motifs in ancient Egypt and was also used decoratively by neighbouring cultures . Coptic Christians adapted it into the crux ansata , a shape with a circular rather than oval loop , and used it as a variant of the Christian cross . Since the late 20th century , in the Western world , the ankh has again come to be used decoratively , as a symbol of African cultural identity , Neopagan belief systems , and the goth subculture .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_religion": "Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals that formed an integral part of ancient Egyptian society . It centered on the Egyptians ' interactions with many deities believed to be present in , and in control of , the world . Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor . Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs , the rulers of Egypt , believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions . They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods , and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain Ma'at , the order of the cosmos . The state dedicated enormous resources to religious rituals and to the construction of temples . Individuals could interact with the gods for their own purposes , appealing for help through prayer or compelling the gods to act through magic . These practices were distinct from , but closely linked with , the formal rituals and institutions . The popular religious tradition grew more prominent over the course of Egyptian history as the status of the pharaoh declined . Egyptian belief in the afterlife and the importance of funerary practices is evident in the great efforts made to ensure the survival of their souls after death - via the provision of tombs , grave goods and offerings to preserve the bodies and spirits of the deceased . The religion had its roots and branches in Egypt 's prehistory and lasted for more than 3,000 years . The details of religious belief changed over time as the importance of particular gods rose and declined , and their intricate relationships shifted .",

A Kemetic is one who follows Kemetism . There are several main groups , each of which takes a different approach to their beliefs , ranging from eclectic to reconstructionist . However , all of these can be identified as belonging to three strains , including : reconstructed Kemetism ( adopting a philological and scholarly approach ) , a syncretic approach , and a more novel synthesis tending toward monotheism , Kemetic Orthodoxy .",
  "/wiki/Neo-paganism": "Modern Paganism , also known as Contemporary Paganism and Neopaganism , is a collective term for new religious movements influenced by or derived from the various historical pagan beliefs of pre-modern peoples . Although they share similarities , contemporary Pagan religious movements are diverse , and do not share a single set of beliefs , practices , or texts . Most academics who study the phenomenon treat it as a movement that is divided into different religions ; others characterize it as a single religion of which different Pagan faiths are denominations . Adherents rely on pre-Christian , folkloric , and ethnographic sources to a variety of degrees ; many follow a spirituality that they accept as entirely modern , while others claim prehistoric beliefs , or else attempt to revive indigenous , ethnic religions as accurately as possible . Academic research has placed the Pagan movement along a spectrum , with eclecticism on one end and polytheistic reconstructionism on the other . Polytheism , animism , and pantheism are common features of Pagan theology . Contemporary Paganism has sometimes been associated with the New Age movement , with scholars highlighting both their similarities and differences . In the 1990s , scholars who study the modern Pagan movement established the academic field of Pagan studies .",

Belomancy was anciently practised at least by Babylonians , Greeks , Arabs and Scythians . The arrows were typically marked with occult symbols and had to have feathers for every method . In one method , different possible answers to a given question were written and tied to each arrow . For example , three arrows would be marked with the phrases , God orders it me , God forbids it me , and the third would be blank . The arrow that flew the furthest indicated the answer . Another method involves the same thing , but without shooting the arrows . They would simply be shuffled in the quiver , worn preferably on the back , and the first arrow to be drawn indicated the answer . If a blank arrow was drawn , they would redraw . This was an ancient practice , and probably that mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel 21:21 , shown below in the original Hebrew , and translated to English in the New American Standard Bible ,",

It first came into popular English usage in the 19th century during debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templars . Since 1856 , the name Baphomet has been associated with the Sabbatic Goat image drawn by \u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi , which contains binary elements representing the symbolization of the equilibrium of opposites ( e.g . half-human and half-animal , male and female , good and evil , on and off , etc. ) .

  "/wiki/Knights_Templar": "The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon ( Latin : Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici ) , also known as the Order of Solomon 's Temple , the Knights Templar or simply the Templars , were a Catholic military order founded in 1119 and recognised in 1139 by the papal bull Omne datum optimum . The order was active until 1312 when it was perpetually suppressed by Pope Clement V by the bull Vox in excelso . The Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power . They were prominent in Christian finance . Templar knights , in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross , were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades . Non-combatant members of the order , who made up as much as 90 % of their members , managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom , developing innovative financial techniques that were an early form of banking , building its own network of nearly 1,000 commanderies and fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land , and arguably forming the world 's first multinational corporation . The Templars were closely tied to the Crusades ; when the Holy Land was lost , support for the order faded . Rumours about the Templars ' secret initiation ceremony created distrust , and King Philip IV of France - deeply in debt to the order - took advantage of this distrust to destroy them and erase his debt . In 1307 , he had many of the order 's members in France arrested , tortured into giving false confessions , and burned at the stake . Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312 under pressure from King Philip . The abrupt reduction in power of a significant group in European society gave rise to speculation , legend , and legacy through the ages .",
  "/wiki/Theistic_Satanism": "Theistic Satanism or spiritual Satanism is an umbrella term for religious beliefs that consider Satan as an objectively existing supernatural being or force worthy of supplication , with whom individuals may contact , convene and even praise , rather than him being just an archetype , symbol or idea as in LaVeyan Satanism . The individual belief systems under this umbrella are practiced by loosely affiliated or independent groups and cabals . Another characteristic of theistic Satanism is the use of ceremonial magic . The history of theistic Satanism , as an existing spiritual path practiced by people , is obscured by a number of groups accused of being devil-worshippers who asserted that they were not , such as in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe .

  "/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism": "LaVeyan Satanism is a religion founded in 1966 by the American occultist and author Anton Szandor LaVey . Scholars of religion have classified it as a new religious movement and a form of Western esotericism . It is one of several different movements that describe themselves as forms of Satanism . LaVey established LaVeyan Satanism in the U.S. state of California through the founding of his Church of Satan on Walpurgisnacht of 1966 , which he proclaimed to be the Year One , Anno Satanas - the first year of the Age of Satan . His ideas were heavily influenced by the ideas and writings of Friedrich Nietzsche and Ayn Rand . The church grew under LaVey 's leadership , with regional grottos being founded across the United States . A number of these seceded from the church to form independent Satanic organizations during the early 1970s . In 1975 , LaVey abolished the grotto system , after which Satanism became a far less organized movement , although it remained greatly influenced by LaVey 's writings . In coming years , members of the church left it to establish their own organisations , also following LaVeyan Satanism , among them John Dewey Allee 's First Church of Satan and Karla LaVey 's First Satanic Church . The religion 's doctrines are codified in LaVey 's book , The Satanic Bible . The religion is materialist , rejecting the existence of supernatural beings , body-soul dualism , and life after death .

The work is structured into 22 chapters , which parallel the Tarot . L\u00e9vi 's Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie was translated into English by Arthur Edward Waite as Transcendental Magic , its Doctrine and Ritual ( 1896 ) . Waite added a biographical preface and footnotes . The work has recently attracted the attention of scholars for its views on the study of magic , religion and natural science . L\u00e9vi sees magic in between science and religion and believes it serves a potential conciliatory or mediating function between the two views . L\u00e9vi rejects views , such as E. B. Taylor 's , that magic or religion is inherently irrational and has been superseded by modern science . Instead he posits magic as an esoteric science and suggests that Hermeticism could be adapted to find the underlying truth behind all magical systems , calling for a comparative magic . Levi thus posits a type of Perennialism buttressed by comparative theology and comparative religion , anticipating modern-day religious studies and paralleling contemporary comparative projects in anthropology and philology such as the work of Max M\u00fcller .",

  "/wiki/Alchemy": "Alchemy ( from Arabic : al-k\u012bmiy\u0101 ) was an ancient branch of natural philosophy , a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practised throughout Europe , Africa , and Asia , originating in Greco-Roman Egypt in the first few centuries . Alchemists attempted to purify , mature , and perfect certain materials . [ n 1 ] Common aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of base metals ( e.g. , lead ) into noble metals ( particularly gold ) ; the creation of an elixir of immortality ; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease ; and the development of an alkahest , a universal solvent . The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and , in the Hellenistic and Western mystery tradition , the achievement of gnosis . In Europe , the creation of a philosopher 's stone was variously connected with all of these projects . In English , the term is often limited to descriptions of European alchemy , but similar practices existed in the Far East , the Indian subcontinent , and the Muslim world . In Europe , following the 12th-century Renaissance produced by the translation of Medieval Islamic works on science and the rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy , alchemists played a significant role in early modern science ( particularly chemistry and medicine ) . Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques , theory , terminology , and experimental method , some of which are still in use today . However , they continued antiquity 's belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism . Their work was guided by Hermetic principles related to magic , mythology , and religion . Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , despite the arguments of scholars like Holmyard and von Franz that they should be understood as complementary . The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred .",

The symbol originates from the Catholic tradition that when sentenced to death , Peter requested that his cross be upside down , as he felt unworthy of being crucified in the same manner as Jesus .

  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",
  "/wiki/Satanism": "Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on Satan . Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966 , although a few historical precedents exist . Prior to the public practice , Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents , rather than a self-identity . Satanism , and the concept of Satan , has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression . Accusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history . During the Middle Ages , the Inquisition attached to the Catholic Church alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups , such as the Knights Templar and the Cathars , performed secret Satanic rituals . In the subsequent Early Modern period , belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in mass trials of alleged witches across Europe and the North American colonies . Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active , and behind events such as Protestantism ( and conversely , the Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist ) and the French Revolution continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century . The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential Taxil hoax of France in the 1890s , which claimed that Freemasonry worshiped Satan , Lucifer , and Baphomet in their rituals . In the 1980s and 1990s , the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom , amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites . In most of these cases , there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them . Since the 19th century , various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography .",

  "/wiki/Anti-Christian_sentiment": "Criticism of Christianity has a long history stretching back to the initial formation of the religion during the Roman Empire . Critics have challenged Christian beliefs and teachings as well as Christian actions , from the Crusades to modern terrorism . The intellectual arguments against Christianity include the suppositions that it is a faith of violence , corruption , superstition , polytheism , and bigotry . In the early years of Christianity , the Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry emerged as one of the major critics with his book Against the Christians . Porphyry argued that Christianity was based on false prophecies that had not yet materialized . Following the adoption of Christianity under the Roman Empire , dissenting religious voices were gradually suppressed by both governments and ecclesiastical authorities . A millennium later , the Protestant Reformation led to a fundamental split in European Christianity and rekindled critical voices about the Christian faith , both internally and externally . With the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment , Christianity was criticized by major thinkers and philosophers , such as Voltaire , David Hume , Thomas Paine , and the Baron d'Holbach . The central theme of these critiques sought to negate the historical accuracy of the Christian Bible and focused on the perceived corruption of Christian religious authorities . Other thinkers , like Immanuel Kant , launched systematic and comprehensive critiques of Christian theology by attempting to refute arguments for theism . In modern times , Christianity has faced substantial criticism from a wide array of political movements and ideologies . In the late eighteenth century , the French Revolution saw a number of politicians and philosophers criticizing traditional Christian doctrines , precipitating a wave of secularism in which hundreds of churches were closed down and thousands of priests were deported .",

He was most often depicted as a falcon , most likely a lanner falcon or peregrine falcon , or as a man with a falcon head . The earliest recorded form of Horus is the tutelary deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt , who is the first known national god , specifically related to the ruling pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and Osiris in death . The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of Isis and Osiris , and he plays a key role in the Osiris myth as Osiris 's heir and the rival to Set , the murderer and brother of Osiris . In another tradition Hathor is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife .",
  "/wiki/Eye_of_Providence": "The Eye of Providence ( or the all-seeing eye of God ) is a symbol , having its origin in Christian iconography , showing an eye often surrounded by rays of light or a glory and usually enclosed by a triangle .

In the modern era , a notable depiction of the eye is the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States , which appears on the United States one-dollar bill .",
  "/wiki/Christian_iconography": "Iconography , as a branch of art history , studies the identification , description , and the interpretation of the content of images : the subjects depicted , the particular compositions and details used to do so , and other elements that are distinct from artistic style . The word iconography comes from the Greek \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd ( image ) and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( to write or to draw ) . A secondary meaning ( based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms ) is the production or study of the religious images , called icons , in the Byzantine and Orthodox Christian tradition ( see Icon ) . This usage , which many consider simply incorrect , is mostly found in works translated from languages such as Greek or Russian , with the correct term being icon painting . In art history , an iconography may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image , such as the number of figures used , their placing and gestures . The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history , for example semiotics and media studies , and in general usage , for the content of images , the typical depiction in images of a subject , and related senses . Sometimes distinctions have been made between iconology and iconography , although the definitions , and so the distinction made , varies . When referring to movies , genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography , motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition .",

In her most abstract form , she represents the female sexual impulse and the liberated woman . In the creed of the Gnostic Mass she is also identified with Mother Earth , in her most fertile sense . At the same time , Crowley believed that Babalon had an earthly aspect in the form of a spiritual office , which could be filled by actual women - usually as a counterpart to his own identification as To Mega Therion ( The Great Beast ) - whose duty was then to help manifest the energies of the current Aeon of Horus . He believed in his life the Lady of Babalon was personified as Lady Leah Hirsig , who , after several portraits , was consecrated , taking the name Alostrael . Babalon 's consort is Chaos , the Father of Life and the male form of the Creative Principle . Babalon is often described as being girt with a sword [ citation needed ] and riding the Beast . She is often referred to as a sacred whore , and her primary symbol is the Chalice or Graal . As Crowley wrote in his The Book of Thoth , she rides astride the Beast ; in her left hand she holds the reins , representing the passion which unites them . In her right she holds aloft the cup , the Holy Grail aflame with love and death . In this cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the Aeon .",
  "/wiki/Hexagram": "A hexagram ( Greek ) or sexagram ( Latin ) is a six-pointed geometric star figure with the Schl\u00e4fli symbol { 6/2 } , 2 { 3 } , or { { 3 } } . Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams , the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two equilateral triangles shown to the right . The intersection is a regular hexagon . The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional simplices . In three dimensions , the analogous compound is the stellated octahedron , and in four dimensions the compound of two 5-cells is obtained . It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs ; for example by medieval Muslims , especially Hanafi and Maliki dynasties , and later in Judaism and occultism . The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue . It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period , known as the Seal of Solomon , depicted as either a hexagram or pentagram , and which was later adopted by Jewish Kabbalists .",

In modern , typically American and European use , mandala has become a generic term for any circle ornament which can be used as a relaxing tool , for diagnostic ( f.e . MARI card test [ further explanation needed ] ) or in art therapy . In various spiritual traditions , mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts , as a spiritual guidance tool , for establishing a sacred space and as an aid to meditation and trance induction . It is used as a map ( in Shintoism ) in the Indian religions of Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism or Japanese religion of Shintoism representing deities , or in the case of Shintoism , paradises , kami or actual shrines . In New Age , the mandala is a diagram , chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically ; a time-microcosm of the universe , but it originally meant to represent wholeness and a model for the organizational structure of life itself , a cosmic diagram that shows the relation to the infinite and the world that extends beyond and within minds and bodies .",

Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel . It encompasses a wide body of texts , practices , theological positions , and forms of organization . The Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible , and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud . With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide , Judaism is the tenth largest religion in the world . Within Judaism there are a variety of movements , most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism , which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah . Historically , all or part of this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period ; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period ; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations . Modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic . Today , the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism ( Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism ) , Conservative Judaism , and Reform Judaism . Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to Jewish law , the authority of the Rabbinic tradition , and the significance of the State of Israel . Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin , eternal and unalterable , and that they should be strictly followed . Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal , with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism 's requirements than Reform Judaism .",

It was often depicted in either a pentagram or hexagram shape ; the latter also known as the Star of David in Jewish tradition . This ring variously gave Solomon the power to command demons , jinn ( genies ) , or to speak with animals . Due to the proverbial wisdom of Solomon , his signet ring , or its supposed design , it came to be seen as an amulet or talisman , or a symbol or character in medieval and Renaissance-era magic , occultism , and alchemy . The legend of the Seal of Solomon was developed primarily by medieval Arabic writers , who related that the ring was engraved by God and was given to the king directly from heaven . The ring was made from brass and iron , and the two parts were used to seal written commands to good and evil spirits , respectively . In one tale , a demon - either Asmodeus or Sakhr - obtained possession of the ring and ruled in Solomon 's stead for forty days . In a variant of the tale of the ring of Polycrates from Herodotus , the demon eventually threw the ring into the sea , where it was swallowed by a fish , caught by a fisherman , and served to Solomon . In Islamic eschatology , the Beast of the Earth is equipped with both the Staff of Moses and the Seal of Solomon and uses the latter to stamp the nose of the unbelievers . The date of origin legends surrounding the Seal of Solomon is difficult to establish . It is known that a legend of a magic ring with which the possessor could command demons was already current in the 1st century ( Josephus 8.2 telling of one Eleazar who used such a ring in the presence of Vespasian ) , but the association of the name of Solomon with such a ring is medieval notwithstanding the 2nd century apocryphal text the Testament of Solomon .

  "/wiki/Astrology": "Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects . Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE , and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications . Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events , and some - such as the Hindus , Chinese , and the Maya - developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations . Western astrology , one of the oldest astrological systems still in use , can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia , from which it spread to Ancient Greece , Rome , the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe . Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person 's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects ; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems . :83 Throughout most of its history , astrology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles , often in close relation with astronomy , alchemy , meteorology , and medicine . It was present in political circles and is mentioned in various works of literature , from Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer to William Shakespeare , Lope de Vega , and Calder\u00f3n de la Barca . Following the end of the 19th century and the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method , astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical:249 ; and experimental grounds , and has been shown to have no scientific validity or explanatory power . Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing , and common belief in it has largely declined . While polls have demonstrated that approximately one quarter of American , British , and Canadian people say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives , astrology is now recognized as a pseudoscience - a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific .",

Sometimes called the Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the House of Tudor . Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , the Roman Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels . In 1558 upon Mary 's death , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir ; however , despite numerous courtships , she never did .",

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries .

  "/wiki/Rosicrucianism": "Rosicrucianism is a spiritual and cultural movement which arose in Europe in the early 17th century after the publication of several texts which purported to announce the existence of a hitherto unknown esoteric order to the world and made seeking its knowledge attractive to many . The mysterious doctrine of the order is built on esoteric truths of the ancient past , which concealed from the average man , provide insight into nature , the physical universe , and the spiritual realm . The manifestos do not elaborate extensively on the matter , but clearly combine references to Kabbalah , Hermeticism , alchemy , and Christian mysticism . The Rosicrucian manifestos heralded a universal reformation of mankind , through a science allegedly kept secret for decades until the intellectual climate might receive it . Controversies arose on whether they were a hoax , whether the Order of the Rosy Cross existed as described in the manifestos , and whether the whole thing was a metaphor disguising a movement that really existed , but in a different form . In 1616 , Johann Valentin Andreae famously designated it as a ludibrium . Some scholars of esotericism suggest that this statement was later made by Andreae in order to shield himself from the wrath of the religious and political institutions of the day , which were intolerant of free speech and the idea of a universal reformation , which the manifestos called for . An example of the rosicrucian rosy cross symbol predating the early rosicrucian manifestoes is that shown on the central panel of the Harbaville Triptych , which is Byzantine and comes from the 10th or 11th century . The symbol is a Calvary cross with a rose in its centre , which is identical with what the masonic/rosicrucian scholar Manly Palmer Hall claimed to be the original symbol of the rosicrucians . In his work Silentium Post Clamores ( 1617 ) , the rosicrucian Michel Maier ( 1568-1622 ) described rosicrucianism as having arisen from a Primordial Tradition in the following statement : Our origins are Egyptian , Brahmanic , derived from the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace , the Magi of Persia , the Pythagoreans , and the Arabs . By promising a spiritual transformation at a time of great turmoil , the manifestos influenced many figures to seek esoteric knowledge . Seventeenth-century occult philosophers such as Michael Maier , Robert Fludd , and Thomas Vaughan interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view .",

Known as a magical order , the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development . Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions , such as Wicca and Thelema , were inspired by the Golden Dawn , which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism . The three founders , William Robert Woodman , William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell Mathers , were Freemasons . Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn . The Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the Masonic lodges ; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men . The Golden Dawn was the first of three Orders , although all three are often collectively referred to as the Golden Dawn . The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the Hermetic Qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four classical elements as well as the basics of astrology , tarot divination , and geomancy . The Second or Inner Order , the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis ( the Ruby Rose and Cross of Gold ) , taught magic , including scrying , astral travel , and alchemy .

  "/wiki/Runes": "Runes are the letters in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets , which were used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for specialised purposes thereafter . The Scandinavian variants are also known as futhark or fu\u00feark ( derived from their first six letters of the alphabet : F , U , \u00de , A , R , and K ) ; the Anglo-Saxon variant is futhorc or fu\u00feorc ( due to sound-changes undergone in Old English by the names of those six letters ) . Runology is the study of the runic alphabets , runic inscriptions , runestones , and their history . Runology forms a specialised branch of Germanic linguistics . The earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD . The characters were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianisation , by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in northern Europe . However , the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe . Until the early 20th century , runes were used in rural Sweden for decorative purposes in Dalarna and on Runic calendars . The three best-known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark ( around 150-800 AD ) , the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc ( 400-1100 AD ) , and the Younger Futhark ( 800-1100 AD ) . The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes ( also called Danish , although they were also used in Norway , Sweden , and Frisia ) ; short-branch or R\u00f6k runes ( also called Swedish-Norwegian , although they were also used in Denmark ) ; and the stavl\u00f6sa or H\u00e4lsinge runes ( staveless runes ) . The Younger Futhark developed further into the Medieval runes ( 1100-1500 AD ) , and the Dalecarlian runes ( c. 1500-1800 AD ) . Historically , the runic alphabet is a derivation of the Old Italic scripts of antiquity , with the addition of some innovations .",

The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology , Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities , beings , and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period , including medieval manuscripts , archaeological representations , and folk tradition . The source texts mention numerous gods , such as the hammer-wielding , humanity-protecting thunder-god Thor , who relentlessly fights his foes ; the one-eyed , raven-flanked god Odin , who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet ; the beautiful , sei\u00f0r-working , feathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among the slain ; the vengeful , skiing goddess Ska\u00f0i , who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore ; the powerful god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r , who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land ; the god Freyr , whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity ; the goddess I\u00f0unn , who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness ; the mysterious god Heimdallr , who is born of nine mothers , can hear grass grow , has gold teeth , and possesses a resounding horn ; the j\u00f6tunn Loki , who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess Frigg 's beautiful son Baldr ; and numerous other deities . Most of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings , such as humanity and the j\u00f6tnar , beings who may be friends , lovers , foes or family members of the gods . The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central tree , Yggdrasil . Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings . Various forms of a creation myth are recounted , where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir , and the first two humans are Ask and Embla . These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnar\u00f6k when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies , and the world is enveloped in flames , only to be reborn anew . There the surviving gods will meet , and the land will be fertile and green , and two humans will repopulate the world . Norse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century , when key texts were brought to the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe . By way of comparative mythology and historical linguistics , scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology reaching as far back as Proto-Indo-European mythology . During the modern period , the Romanticist Viking revival re-awoke an interest in the subject matter , and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture .",
  "/wiki/Heathenry_(new_religious_movement)": "Heathenry , also termed Heathenism , contemporary Germanic Paganism , or Germanic Neopaganism , is a modern Pagan religion . Scholars of religious studies classify it as a new religious movement . Developed in Europe during the early 20th century , its practitioners model it on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of the Iron Age and Early Middle Ages . In an attempt to reconstruct these past belief systems , Heathenry uses surviving historical , archaeological , and folkloric evidence as a basis , although approaches to this material vary considerably . Heathenry does not have a unified theology but is typically polytheistic , centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe . It adopts cosmological views from these past societies , including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits . The religion 's deities and spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as bl\u00f3ts in which food and libations are offered to them . These are often accompanied by symbel , the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage . Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions , most notably sei\u00f0r and galdr , with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities . Many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves . Other Heathens assemble in small groups , usually known as kindreds or hearths , to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings . Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor , personal integrity , and loyalty , while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized .",

The conventional dates of Solomon 's reign are about 970 to 931 BCE , normally given in alignment with the dates of David 's reign . He is described as king of the United Monarchy , which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death . Following the split , his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone . According to the Talmud , Solomon is one of the 48 prophets . In the Quran , he is considered a major prophet , and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman , son of David . The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem , beginning in the fourth year of his reign , using the vast wealth he and his father had accumulated . He dedicated the temple to Yahweh , the God of Israel . He is portrayed as great in wisdom , wealth and power beyond either of the previous kings of the country , but also as a king who sinned . His sins included idolatry , marrying foreign women and , ultimately , turning away from Yahweh , and they led to the kingdom 's being torn in two during the reign of his son Rehoboam . Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends , most notably in the 1st century apocryphal work known as the Testament of Solomon . In the New Testament , he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom excelled by Jesus , and as arrayed in glory , but excelled by the lilies of the field .",

  "/wiki/Theosophy_(Blavatskian)": "Theosophy is a religion established in the United States during the late nineteenth century . It was founded primarily by the Russian immigrant Helena Blavatsky and draws its beliefs predominantly from Blavatsky 's writings . Categorised by scholars of religion as both a new religious movement and as part of the occultist stream of Western esotericism , it draws upon both older European philosophies such as Neoplatonism and Asian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism . As presented by Blavatsky , Theosophy teaches that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters , who - although found across the world - are centered in Tibet . These Masters are believed to have cultivated great wisdom and supernatural powers , and Theosophists believe that it was they who initiated the modern Theosophical movement through disseminating their teachings via Blavatsky . They believe that these Masters are attempting to revive knowledge of an ancient religion once found across the world and which will again come to eclipse the existing world religions . Theosophical groups nevertheless do not refer to their system as a religion . Theosophy preaches the existence of a single , divine Absolute . It promotes an emanationist cosmology in which the universe is perceived as outward reflections from this Absolute . Theosophy teaches that the purpose of human life is spiritual emancipation and claims that the human soul undergoes reincarnation upon bodily death according to a process of karma . It promotes values of universal brotherhood and social improvement , although it does not stipulate particular ethical codes . Theosophy was established in New York City in 1875 with the founding of the Theosophical Society by Blavatsky and two Americans , Henry Olcott and William Quan Judge .",
  "/wiki/Swastika": "The swastika or sauwastika ( as a character , \u5350 or \u534d , respectively ) is a geometrical figure and an ancient religious icon in the cultures of Eurasia . It is used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions , especially Hinduism . In the Western world , it was a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck until the 1930s when it became a feature of Nazi symbolism as an emblem of the so-called Aryan race . As a result of World War II and the Holocaust , most people in Europe and the Americas associate it with Nazism and antisemitism . The word swastika comes from Sanskrit ( Devanagari : \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915 ) meaning 'conducive to well being ' or 'auspicious ' . In Hinduism , the symbol with arms pointing clockwise ( \u5350 ) is called swastika , symbolizing surya ( 'sun ' ) , prosperity and good luck , while the counterclockwise symbol ( \u534d ) is called sauvastika , symbolizing night or tantric aspects of Kali . In Jainism , a swastika is the symbol for Suparshvanatha - the seventh of 24 Tirthankaras ( spiritual teachers and saviours ) , while in Buddhism it symbolizes the auspicious footprints of the Buddha . In several major Indo-European religions , the swastika symbolizes lightning bolts , representing the thunder god and the king of the gods , such as Indra in Vedic Hinduism , Zeus in the ancient Greek religion , Jupiter in the ancient Roman religion , and Thor in the ancient Germanic religion . [ 1 1 ] The swastika is an icon which is widely found in both human history and the modern world . In various forms , it is otherwise known ( in various European languages ) as the fylfot , gammadion , tetraskelion , or cross cramponn\u00e9e ( a term in Anglo-Norman heraldry ) ; German : Hakenkreuz ; French : croix gamm\u00e9e . In China it is named w\u00e0n \u5350 / \u534d / \u842c , meaning 'all things ' , pronounced manji in Japanese . A swastika generally takes the form of a cross , the arms of which are of equal length and perpendicular to the adjacent arms , each bent midway at a right angle .",
  "/wiki/Star_of_David": "The Star of David ( \u2721 ) , known in Hebrew as the Shield of David or Magen David ( Hebrew \u05de\u05b8\u05d2\u05b5\u05df \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5\u05b4\u05d3 ; Biblical Hebrew M\u0101\u1e21\u0113n D\u0101w\u012b\u1e0f [ ma\u02d0\u02c8\u0263e\u02d0n da\u02d0\u02c8wi\u02d0\u00f0 ] , Tiberian [ m\u0254\u02c8\u0263en d\u0254\u02c8vi\u00f0 ] , Modern Hebrew [ ma\u02c8\u0261en da\u02c8vid ] , Ashkenazi Hebrew and Yiddish Mogein Dovid [ \u02c8m\u0254\u0261e\u026an \u02c8d\u0254vid ] or Mogen Dovid ) , is a generally recognized symbol of modern Jewish identity and Judaism . [ page needed ] [ full citation needed ] Its shape is that of a hexagram , the compound of two equilateral triangles . Unlike the menorah , the Lion of Judah , the shofar and the lulav , the Star of David was never a uniquely Jewish symbol . The symbol became representative of the worldwide Zionist community after it was chosen as the central symbol on a flag at the First Zionist Congress in 1897 , due to its usage in some Jewish communities and its lack of specifically religious connotations . The earliest Jewish usage of the symbol was inherited from medieval Arabic literature by Kabbalists for use in talismanic protective amulets ( segulot ) where it was known as the Seal of Solomon among Muslims . The symbol was also used in Christian churches as a decorative motif many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue . During the 19th century the symbol began to proliferate among the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe , ultimately being used among the Jewish communities in the Pale of Settlement . A significant motivating factor , according to scholar Gershom Scholem , was the desire to represent Jewish religion and/or identity in the same manner the Christian cross identified that religion 's believers . Before the 19th century , official use in Jewish communities was generally known only in the region of today 's Czech Republic , Austria and possibly parts of Southern Germany , having begun in medieval Prague . The identification of the term Star of David or Shield of David with the hexagram shape dates to the 17th century . The term Shield of David is also used in the Siddur ( Jewish prayer book ) as a title of the God of Israel .",

In Hinduism , it signifies the essence of the ultimate reality , consciousness or Atman . More broadly , it is a syllable that is chanted either independently or before a spiritual recitation in Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism . The meaning and connotations of Om vary between the diverse schools within and across the various traditions . It is part of the iconography found in ancient and medieval era manuscripts , temples , monasteries and spiritual retreats in Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism . In Hinduism , Om is one of the most important spiritual symbols . It refers to Atman ( soul , self within ) and Brahman ( ultimate reality , entirety of the universe , truth , divine , supreme spirit , cosmic principles , knowledge ) . The syllable is often found at the beginning and the end of chapters in the Vedas , the Upanishads , and other Hindu texts . It is a sacred spiritual incantation made before and during the recitation of spiritual texts , during puja and private prayers , in ceremonies of rites of passages ( sanskara ) such as weddings , and sometimes during meditative and spiritual activities such as Yoga . The syllable Om is also referred to as onkara ( \u0913\u0919\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 , o\u1e45k\u0101ra ) , omkara ( \u0913\u0902\u0915\u093e\u0930 , o\u1e43k\u0101ra ) and pranava ( \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u0935 , pra\u1e47ava ) .",
  "/wiki/Order_of_Nine_Angles": "The Order of Nine Angles ( ONA ; O9A ) is a Satanic and Left-Hand Path occult group based in the United Kingdom , but with associated groups in various other parts of the world . Claiming to have been established in the 1960s , it rose to public recognition in the early 1980s , attracting attention for its neo-Nazi ideologies and activism . Describing its approach as Traditional Satanism , it has been identified by academic researchers as also exhibiting Hermetic and modern Pagan elements in its beliefs . According to the Order 's own account , it was established in the Welsh Marches of Western England during the late 1960s by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre-Christian sect surviving in the region . This account also states that in 1973 a man named Anton Long was initiated into the group , subsequently becoming its Grand Master . Several academic commentators to have studied the ONA express the view that the name Anton Long is probably the pseudonym of the British neo-Nazi activist David Myatt , although Myatt has denied that this is the case . From the late 1970s onward , Long authored a number of books and articles propagating the Order 's ideas , and in 1988 it began production of its own journal , Fenrir . Through these ventures it established links with other neo-Nazi Satanist groups around the world , furthering its cause through embracing the Internet in the 2000s . The ONA promotes the idea that human history can be divided into a series of Aeons , each of which contain a corresponding human civilization . It expresses the view that the current Aeonic civilization is that of the Western , but claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the Magian/Nazarene influence of Judeo-Christian religion , which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order , termed the Imperium . According to Order teachings , this is necessary in order for a Galactic civilization to form , in which Aryan society will colonise the Milky Way . It advocates a spiritual path in which the practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society , committing crimes , embracing political extremism and violence , and carrying out an act of human sacrifice ."
