ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and the surrounding areas from the Taliban , al Qaeda and factional warlords , to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai . In October 2003 , the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan , and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country . From 2006 to 2011 , ISAF became increasingly involved in more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan . Troop contributors included the United States , United Kingdom , Canada , and other NATO member states as well as a number of other countries . The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varied greatly , with the United States sustaining the most casualties overall . In early 2010 , there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan . About 400 of these were used by American - led NATO forces and 300 by the ANSF . ISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014 , with some troops remaining behind in an advisory role as part of ISAF 's successor organization , the Resolute Support Mission .",

  "/wiki/Rear_Admiral": "Rear admiral is a naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain , and below that of a vice admiral . It is regarded as a two star admiral rank , which are also referred to as flag officers or flag ranks . In many navies it is referred to as ( OF-7 ) / ( O-7 ) . It originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy . Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head , who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron . The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral , who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle . In the rear of the naval squadron , a third admiral would command the remaining ships and , as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger , the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals . This has survived into the modern age , with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies . In some European navies ( e.g. , that of France ) , and in the Canadian Forces ' French rank translations , the rank of rear admiral is known as contre-amiral . In the German Navy the rank is known as Konteradmiral , superior to the flotilla admiral ( Commodore in other navies ) .

Gus Grissom , Senior Pilot Ed White , and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee - and destroyed the command module ( CM ) . The name Apollo 1 , chosen by the crew , was made official by NASA in their honor after the fire . Immediately after the fire , NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to determine the cause of the fire , and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA 's investigation . The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical , and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material , and the high pressure , pure oxygen cabin atmosphere . Rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch , which could not be opened against the internal pressure of the cabin . Because the rocket was unfueled , the test had not been considered hazardous , and emergency preparedness for it was poor . During the Congressional investigation , Senator Walter Mondale publicly revealed a NASA internal document citing problems with prime Apollo contractor North American Aviation , which became known as the Phillips Report . This disclosure embarrassed NASA Administrator James E. Webb , who was unaware of the document 's existence , and attracted controversy to the Apollo program .

Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter .",
