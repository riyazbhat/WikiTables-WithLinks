  "/wiki/Control_(2007_film)": "Control is a 2007 British biographical film about the life of Ian Curtis , singer of the late-1970s English post-punk band Joy Division . It is the first feature film directed by Anton Corbijn , who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer . The screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh was based on the biography Touching from a Distance by Curtis 's widow Deborah , who served as a co-producer on the film . Tony Wilson , who released Joy Division 's records through his Factory Records label , also served as a co-producer . Curtis ' bandmates Bernard Sumner , Peter Hook , and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their post-Joy Division incarnation New Order . Control was filmed partly on location in Nottingham , Manchester , and Macclesfield , including areas where Curtis lived , and was shot in colour and then printed to black-and-white . Its title comes from the Joy Division song She 's Lost Control , and that much of the plot deals with the notion that Curtis tried to remain in control of his own life , and yet had no control over his epilepsy and pharmaceutical side effects . Sam Riley and Samantha Morton star as Ian and Deborah Curtis , and the film portrays the events of the couple 's lives from 1973 to 1980 , focusing on their marriage , the formation and career of Joy Division , Ian 's struggle with epilepsy , and his extramarital affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honor\u00e9 , culminating in his May 1980 suicide . Alexandra Maria Lara plays Honor\u00e9 , while James Anthony Pearson , Joe Anderson , and Harry Treadaway play Sumner , Hook , and Morris , respectively . The film also features Toby Kebbell as band manager Rob Gretton and Craig Parkinson as Tony Wilson . Control premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2007 where it won several awards including the Director 's Fortnight , the CICAE Art & Essai prize for best film , the Regards Jeunes Prize for best first/second directed feature film , and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar . It went on to win five British Independent Film Awards including Best Film , Best Director for Corbijn , Most Promising Newcomer for Riley , and Best Supporting Actor for Kebbell",
  "/wiki/Ian_Curtis": "Ian Kevin Curtis ( 15 July 1956 - 18 May 1980 ) was an English singer-songwriter and musician . He was the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division and recorded two albums with the group : Unknown Pleasures ( 1979 ) and Closer ( 1980 ) . Curtis was known for his bass-baritone voice , dance style , and songwriting typically filled with imagery of desolation , emptiness , and alienation . Musically , Curtis was influenced by a range of artists such as David Bowie , Kraftwerk , Sex Pistols , Jim Morrison , Iggy Pop , Roxy Music , Lou Reed and Neu ! , as well as lyrically by writers like William Burroughs , Fyodor Dostoevsky , Friedrich Nietzsche , Jean-Paul Sartre , Franz Kafka , Hermann Hesse , T. S. Eliot , J. G. Ballard , and Yehiel De-Nur . Curtis was particularly influenced by Iggy Pop 's stage persona . Curtis , who suffered from epilepsy and depression , committed suicide on the eve of Joy Division 's first North American tour and shortly before the release of Closer . His death resulted in the band 's dissolution and the subsequent formation of New Order . Despite their short career , Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence . John Bush of AllMusic argues that Joy Division became the first band in the post-punk movement by . emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression , pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s . Joy Division 's influence has extended from contemporaries such as U2 and the Cure to later acts such as Radiohead , Nine Inch Nails , Neurosis , Interpol , Bloc Party , Editors and some rap artists",

  "/wiki/Mr._Darcy": "Fitzwilliam Darcy , generally referred to as Mr. Darcy , is one of the two central characters in Jane Austen 's novel Pride and Prejudice . He is an archetype of the aloof romantic hero , and a romantic interest of Elizabeth Bennet , the novel 's protagonist . The story 's narration is almost exclusively from Elizabeth 's perspective ; the reader is given a one-sided view of Darcy for much of the novel , but hints are given throughout that there is much more to his character than meets the eye . The reader gets a healthy dose of dramatic irony as Elizabeth continually censures ( with some prejudice ) Mr. Darcy 's character despite the aforementioned hints ( via the narrative voice and other characters ' observations ) that Mr. Darcy is really a noble character at heart , albeit somewhat prideful . Usually referred to only as Mr. Darcy or Darcy by characters and the narrator , his first name is mentioned twice in the novel",
