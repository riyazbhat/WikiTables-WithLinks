Christmas Island is located in the Indian Ocean , around 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) south of Java and Sumatra and around 1,550 kilometres ( 960 mi ) north-west of the closest point on the Australian mainland . It has an area of 135 square kilometres ( 52 sq mi ) . Christmas Island had a population of 1,843 residents as of 2016 [ update ] , the majority of whom live in settlements on the northern tip of the island . The main settlement is Flying Fish Cove . Historically , Asian Australians of Chinese , Malay , and Indian descent collectively formed the vast majority of the population . Today , around two-thirds of the island 's population is estimated to have Malaysian Chinese or Singaporean Chinese origin ( though just 21.2% of the population declared a Chinese ancestry in 2016 ) , with significant numbers of Malays and European Australians and smaller numbers of Malaysian Indians and Eurasians . Several languages are in use , including English , Malay , and various Chinese dialects . Islam and Buddhism are major religions on the island , though a vast majority of the population does not declare a formal religious affiliation and may be involved in ethnic Chinese religion . [ original research ? ] The first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the Thomas in 1615 . The island was later named on Christmas Day ( 25 December ) 1643 by Captain William Mynors but only settled in the late 19th century .",

  "/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

A temporary mortuary was set up at Melbourne 's Spencer Street Station to deal with the dead and wounded , who were transported from Sunshine by special relief trains . The disaster is Victoria 's worst railway accident in terms of deaths , and is Australia 's second-worst after the 1977 Granville rail disaster . The susbsequent coronial inquiry found that the two drivers of the Bendigo train as well as the Sunshine stationmaster had a manslaughter case to answer , although all three were later acquitted by the Supreme Court of Victoria .",
  "/wiki/Fire": "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products . Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition . Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen , O2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy ( 418 kJ per 32 g of O2 ) ; the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here . At a certain point in the combustion reaction , called the ignition point , flames are produced . The flame is the visible portion of the fire . Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide , water vapor , oxygen and nitrogen . If hot enough , the gases may become ionized to produce plasma . Depending on the substances alight , and any impurities outside , the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different . Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning . Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe . The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems . The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property , atmospheric pollution , and water contamination .",

Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 .

  "/wiki/USAAF": "The United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF or AAF ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army , and de facto aerial warfare service branch of the United States , during and immediately after World War II ( 1939/41-1945 ) , successor to the previous United States Army Air Corps , and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force of today , one of the five uniformed military services . The AAF was a component of the United States Army , which on 2 March 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces : the Army Ground Forces , the Services of Supply ( which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces ) , and the Army Air Forces . Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff . The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps , General Headquarters Air Force , and the ground forces ' corps area commanders , and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel . The peak size of the AAF during the Second World War was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944 , and 783 domestic bases in December 1943 . By V-E Day , the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide . The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently , to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force , and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1914 . The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps , which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 , and the GHQ Air Force , which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom . Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy ( such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe ) , the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947 . In its expansion and conduct of the war , the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization . By the end of World War II , the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service . By regulation and executive order , it was a subordinate agency of the United States Department of War ( as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces ) tasked only with organizing , training , and equipping combat units , and limited in responsibility to the continental United States .",
  "/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers , the Boeing entry ( prototype Model 299/XB-17 ) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps ' performance specifications . Although Boeing lost the contract ( to the Douglas B-18 Bolo ) because the prototype crashed , the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation . From its introduction in 1938 , the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances , becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time , behind the four-engined B-24 and the multirole , twin-engined Ju 88 . The B-17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets . The United States Eighth Air Force , based at many airfields in central , eastern and southern England , and the Fifteenth Air Force , based in Italy , complemented the RAF Bomber Command 's nighttime area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities , factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944 . The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the War in the Pacific , early in World War II , where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields . From its prewar inception , the USAAC ( by June 1941 , the USAAF ) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon ; it was a relatively fast , high-flying , long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload . It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base . The B-17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II . Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft , over 640,000 tons were dropped from B-17s . In addition to its role as a bomber , the B-17 was also employed as a transport , antisubmarine aircraft , drone controller , and search-and-rescue aircraft .",

From its source in the Yarra Ranges , it flows 242 kilometres ( 150 mi ) west through the Yarra Valley which opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne before emptying into Hobsons Bay in northernmost Port Phillip . The river was a major food source and meeting place for indigenous Australians from prehistoric times . Shortly after the arrival of European settlers land clearing forced the remaining Wurundjeri to neighbouring territories and away from the river . Originally called Birrarung by the Wurundjeri , the current name was mistranslated from another Wurundjeri term in the Boonwurrung language ; Yarro-yarro , meaning ever-flowing . The river was utilised primarily for agriculture by early European settlers . The landscape of the river has changed dramatically since 1835 . The course has been progressively disrupted and the river widened in places . The first of many Crossings of the Yarra River to facilitate transport was built in Princes Bridge .

The aircraft was enroute from Townsville to Brisbane with a scheduled stop in Rockhampton . It 's believed the crash was caused by a fire in one of the engines which caused an explosion , destroying part of the aircraft causing it to disintegrate and crash . Those killed included twenty United States Armed Forces personnel , eight Australian Defence Force personnel , an Australian war photographer , a representative from the YMCA and an adjutant from the Salvation Army . Due to wartime censorship , there was very little press coverage of the accident , with the few newspaper articles that were published focusing on the non-combatants on-board such as Harold Dick ( war photographer ) , Nigel James MacDonald ( YMCA ) and William Tibbs ( Salvation Army ) . However , those stories only mentioned that they had been killed in a plane accident with no specific details about the disaster . With so many locals still unaware of the disaster at the turn of the century , Yeppoon resident John Millroy began campaigning for a permanent memorial at the crash site to commemorate those who died . After securing $ 14,000 in government funding , a monument was unveiled by World War II servicemen Neville Hewitt and Yeppoon RSL president Wayne Carter on 16 June 2012 . Rockhampton mayor Margaret Strelow and Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley attended the ceremony . Wensley said it was good the tragedy was being remembered while Strelow praised Millroy for his part in organising the memorial . Annual memorial services are now held at the crash site .
