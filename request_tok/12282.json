  "/wiki/Construction": "Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . Construction starts with planning , design , and financing ; it continues until the project is built and ready for use . Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . A project manager normally manages the budget on the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or architect supervises it . Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements , environmental impact of the job , scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding .

It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1,243 miles ( 2,000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume , the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific . The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the region 's many cultural groups . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean . These fish - especially the salmon species - provided the core subsistence for native peoples . In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route .",
  "/wiki/Electricity": "Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge . In early days , electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism . Later on , many experimental results and the development of Maxwell 's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon : electromagnetism . Various common phenomena are related to electricity , including lightning , static electricity , electric heating , electric discharges and many others . The presence of an electric charge , which can be either positive or negative , produces an electric field . The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field . When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field , a force will act on it . The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb 's law . Thus , if that charge were to move , the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge . Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space , which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts . Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies , being used for :",
  "/wiki/Electricity_generation": "Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy . For utilities in the electric power industry , it is the stage prior to its delivery to end users ( transmission , distribution , etc . ) or its storage ( using , for example , the pumped-storage method ) . A characteristic of electricity is that it is not freely available in nature in large amounts , so it must be produced ( that is , transforming other forms of energy to electricity ) . Production is carried out in power stations ( also called power plants ) . Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators , primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind . Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power .",
  "/wiki/Hydroelectricity": "Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower . In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6 % of the world 's total electricity and 70 % of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1 % each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9 % of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) . However , when constructed in lowland rainforest areas , where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary , they actually emit up to 3 to 4 times more greenhouse gases [ clarification needed ] ( see also Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs # Greenhouse_gases ) .",
  "/wiki/Dam": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",

  "/wiki/Hydropower": "Hydropower or water power ( from Greek : \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 , water ) is power derived from the energy of falling or fast-running water , which may be harnessed for useful purposes . Since ancient times , hydropower from many kinds of watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices , such as gristmills , sawmills , textile mills , trip hammers , dock cranes , domestic lifts , and ore mills . A trompe , which produces compressed air from falling water , is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance . In the late 19th century , hydropower became a source for generating electricity . Cragside in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878 and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at Niagara Falls in 1879 . In 1881 , street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower . Since the early 20th century , the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of hydroelectric power . International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a means for economic development without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere , but dams can have significant negative social and environmental impacts .",

In the course of those voyages , Gray explored portions of that coast and , in 1790 , completed the first American circumnavigation of the world . Perhaps his most remembered accomplishment from his explorations was his coming upon and then naming of the Columbia River in 1792 , while on his second voyage . Gray 's earlier and later life are both comparatively obscure . He was born in Tiverton , Rhode Island , and may have served in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War . After his two famous voyages , he carried on his career as a sea captain , mainly of merchantmen in the Atlantic . This included what was meant to be a third voyage to the Northwest Coast , but was ended by the capture of his ship by French privateers , during the Franco-American Quasi-War , and command of an American privateer later in that same conflict .

The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",

  "/wiki/Seacoast_Defense_(US)": "Seacoast defense was a major concern for the United States from its independence until World War II . Before airplanes , many of America 's enemies could only reach it from the sea , making coastal forts an economical alternative to standing armies or a large navy . After the 1940s , it was recognized that fixed fortifications were obsolete and ineffective against aircraft and missiles . However , in prior eras foreign fleets were a realistic threat , and substantial fortifications were built at key locations , especially protecting major harbors . The defenses heavily depended on fortifications but also included submarine minefields , nets and booms , ships , and airplanes . Therefore , all of the armed forces participated in seacoast defense , but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers played the central role in constructing fixed defenses . Designs evolved and became obsolete with changes in the technology available to both the attacking forces and the defenders . The evolution of the U.S. seacoast defense system is generally identified among several systems , which are somewhat defined by the styles used , but more so by the events or trends which periodically stimulated new funding and construction . The division of the early forts into the First and Second Systems was made by later historians , and appears officially in an 1851 report by Chief Engineer Joseph Totten , probably the most prolific builder of masonry forts in American history .",

  "/wiki/National_park": "A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes . Often it is a reserve of natural , semi-natural , or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns . Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently , there is a common idea : the conservation of 'wild nature ' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride . An international organization , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , and its World Commission on Protected Areas ( WCPA ) , has defined National Park as its Category II type of protected areas . According to the IUCN , 6,555 national parks worldwide met its criteria in 2006 . IUCN is still discussing the parameters of defining a national park . While this type of national park had been proposed previously , the United States established the first public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people , Yellowstone National Park , in 1872 . Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a national park in its establishing law , it was always termed such in practice and is widely held to be the first and oldest national park in the world . However , the Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve ( established in 1776 ) , and the area surrounding Bogd Khan Uul Mountain ( 1778 ) are seen as the oldest legally protected areas , predating Yellowstone by nearly a century .

The hotel was built by the first Japanese-American architect in Seattle , Sabro Ozasa , and contains the last remaining Japanese bathhouse ( sento ) in the United States . The Panama Hotel was essential to the Japanese community , the building housed businesses , a bathhouse , sleeping quarters for residents and visitors , and restaurants . Since 1985 the Panama Hotel has been owned by Jan Johnson . Johnson , the third owner of the Panama Hotel has restored the building to emulate its previous condition before the evacuation of the Japanese in Seattle . Johnson has closed off the basement that holds the belongings of the Japanese families to the public , and has installed a glass panel in the floorboards for visitors to view the artifacts from above . The Panama Hotel is known for the rich Japanese American history before and during World War II . The hotel is known for housing the belongings of the Japanese families in Seattle once Executive Order 9066 was enacted and the evacuation of Japanese to internment camps . After the Japanese American internment , most of the Seattle-based families were not able to return due to death , financial constraints , and relocation ; their belongings still reside in the basement of the hotel .

  "/wiki/Sento": "Sent\u014d ( \u92ad\u6e6f ) is a type of Japanese communal bathhouse where customers pay for entrance . Traditionally these bathhouses have been quite utilitarian , with a tall barrier separating the sexes within one large room , a minimum of lined up faucets on both sides and a single large bath for the already washed bathers to sit in among others . Since the second half of the 20th century , these communal bathhouses have been decreasing in numbers as more and more Japanese residences now have baths . Some Japanese find social importance in going to public baths , out of the theory that physical proximity/intimacy brings emotional intimacy , which is termed skinship in pseudo-English Japanese . Others go to a sent\u014d because they live in a small housing facility without a private bath or to enjoy bathing in a spacious room and to relax in saunas or jet baths that often accompany new or renovated sent\u014ds . Another type of Japanese public bath is onsen , which uses hot water from a natural hot spring . In general , the word onsen means that the bathing facility has at least one bath filled with natural hot spring water . However , throughout the Kansai region of Japan the word onsen is also a commonly used naming scheme for sent\u014d . Sent\u014d and supersent\u014d in Kansai that do have access to a hot spring will often differentiate themselves by having natural hot spring ( \u5929\u7136\u6e29\u6cc9 ) somewhere on their signage .",

Immigration authorities normally check for appropriate documentation , verify that a person is entitled to enter the country , apprehend people wanted by domestic or international arrest warrants , and impede the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country . Compare illegal emigration . Traditionally customs has been considered as the fiscal subject that charges customs duties and other taxes on import or export . In recent decades , the views on the functions of customs have considerably expanded and now covers three basic issues : taxation , security and trade facilitation . The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 , 2001 , has become the factor that prompted a significant strengthening of the security component in the operations of the modern customs authorities , after which security-oriented control measures for supply chains have been widely implemented for the aims of preventing risk identification . The most complete guidelines for customs security functions implementation is provided in the WCO SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade ( SAFE ) , which have already received five editions in 2005 , 2007 , 2010 , 2012 and 2018 .
