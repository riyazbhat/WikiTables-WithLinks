  "/wiki/Lieutenant": "A lieutenant ( UK : /l\u025bf\u02c8t\u025bn\u0259nt/ lef-TEN-\u0259nt or US : /lu\u02d0\u02c8t\u025bn\u0259nt/ loo-TEN-\u0259nt abbreviated Lt , LT , Lieut and similar ) is the second junior-most or in some cases the junior-most commissioned officer in the armed forces , fire services , police , and other organizations of many nations . The meaning of lieutenant differs in different militaries ( see comparative military ranks ) , but is often subdivided into senior ( first lieutenant ) and junior ( second lieutenant and even third lieutenant ) ranks . In navies it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain ; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank . The rank is also used in fire services , emergency medical services , security services and police forces . Lieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure . It often designates someone who is second-in-command , and as such , may precede the name of the rank directly above it . For example , a lieutenant master is likely to be second-in-command to the master in an organisation using both ranks . Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments , and Quebec lieutenant in Canadian politics . In the United Kingdom , a lord lieutenant is the sovereign 's representative in a county or lieutenancy area , while a deputy lieutenant is one of the lord lieutenant 's deputies .",

Their interests and range of influence extended to all of the sciences and included much of the research performed in universities and the government . They were consciously promoting the development of a professional scientific community in America . The Lazzaroni in the United States actually existed in the 1850s and a little before , though the name was not always the same as the group changed and grew . The Lazzaroni wanted to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities .

  "/wiki/Natural_philosophy": "Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature ( from Latin philosophia naturalis ) was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science . It is considered to be the precursor of natural science . From the ancient world , starting with Aristotle , to the 19th century , natural philosophy was the common term for the practice of studying nature . It was in the 19th century that the concept of science received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as biology and biologist , physics and physicist among other technical fields and titles ; institutions and communities were founded , and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred . Isaac Newton 's book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( 1687 ) , whose title translates to Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , reflects the then-current use of the words natural philosophy , akin to systematic study of nature . Even in the 19th century , a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait , which helped define much of modern physics , was titled Treatise on Natural Philosophy ( 1867 ) . In the German tradition , Naturphilosophie ( philosophy of nature ) persisted into the 18th and 19th century as an attempt to achieve a speculative unity of nature and spirit . Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement , including Goethe , Hegel and Schelling . Naturphilosophie was associated with Romanticism and a view that regarded the natural world as a kind of giant organism , as opposed to the philosophical approach of figures such as John Locke and Isaac Newton who espoused a more mechanical view of the world , regarding it as being like a machine .",
  "/wiki/Chemistry": "Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms , molecules and ions : their composition , structure , properties , behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances . In the scope of its subject , chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology . It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level . For example , chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry ( botany ) , the formation of igneous rocks ( geology ) , how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded ( ecology ) , the properties of the soil on the moon ( astrophysics ) , how medications work ( pharmacology ) , and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene ( forensics ) . Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds . There are four types of chemical bonds : covalent bonds , in which compounds share one or more electron ( s ) ; ionic bonds , in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions ( cations and anions ) ; hydrogen bonds ; and Van der Waals force bonds .",

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas , which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government , who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier . In 1845 , newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk , who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States , sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico . After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces , the United States Congress declared war . U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California , and then moved south . Meanwhile , the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory . The U.S. Army , under Major General Winfield Scott , eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance , having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast , where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing . The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , forced onto the remnant Mexican government , ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States . The U.S. agreed to pay $ 15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $ 3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens . Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States . The victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States , but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties , monetary cost , and heavy-handedness , particularly early on . The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery .",

It was the first major battle of the war fought in Georgia , the most significant Union defeat in the Western Theater , and involved the second-highest number of casualties after the Battle of Gettysburg . The battle was fought between the Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans and the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg , and was named for Chickamauga Creek , which meanders near the battle area in northwest Georgia ( and ultimately flows into the Tennessee River about 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) northeast of downtown Chattanooga ) .

Although it is more popularly known as the siege of Petersburg , it was not a classic military siege , in which a city is usually surrounded and all supply lines are cut off , nor was it strictly limited to actions against Petersburg . The campaign consisted of nine months of trench warfare in which Union forces commanded by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Petersburg unsuccessfully and then constructed trench lines that eventually extended over 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the eastern outskirts of Richmond , Virginia , to around the eastern and southern outskirts of Petersburg . Petersburg was crucial to the supply of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's army and the Confederate capital of Richmond . Numerous raids were conducted and battles fought in attempts to cut off the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad . Many of these battles caused the lengthening of the trench lines . Lee finally gave in to the pressure and abandoned both cities in April 1865 , leading to his retreat and surrender at Appomattox Court House . The Siege of Petersburg foreshadowed the trench warfare that was common in World War I , earning it a prominent position in military history .

  "/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson": "Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson ( January 21 , 1824 - May 10 , 1863 ) served as a Confederate general ( 1861-1863 ) during the American Civil War , and became one of the best-known Confederate commanders after General Robert E. Lee . Jackson played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the Eastern Theater of the war until his death , and played a key role in winning many significant battles . Born in what was then part of Virginia ( in present-day West Virginia ) , Jackson received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point , served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 and distinguished himself at Chapultepec ( 1847 ) . From 1851 to 1863 he taught at the Virginia Military Institute , where he was unpopular with his students . During this time , he married twice . His first wife died giving birth , but his second wife , Mary Anna Morrison , lived until 1915 . When Virginia seceded from the Union in May 1861 after the attack on Fort Sumter ( April 12 , 1861 ) , Jackson joined the Confederate Army . He distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run ( July 21 , 1861 ) the following month , providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce Union assault . In this context Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. compared him to a stone wall , hence his enduring nickname . Jackson performed well in the campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley during 1862 . Despite an initial defeat due largely to faulty intelligence , through swift and careful maneuvers Jackson was able to defeat three separate Union armies and prevent any of them from reinforcing General George B. McClellan 's Army of the Potomac in its campaign against Richmond . Jackson then quickly moved his three divisions to reinforce General Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia in defense of Richmond .",
  "/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run": "The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was the first major battle of the American Civil War and was a Confederate victory . The battle was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west-southwest of Washington , D.C . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy . Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville": "The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville campaign . It was fought from April 30 to May 6 , 1863 , in Spotsylvania County , Virginia , near the village of Chancellorsville . Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg . The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size , General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Chancellorsville is known as Lee 's perfect battle because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory . The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union withdrawal effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman began a long-distance raid against Lee 's supply lines at about the same time . This operation was completely ineffectual .",
  "/wiki/Pneumonia": "Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli . Typically symptoms include some combination of productive or dry cough , chest pain , fever , and trouble breathing . Severity is variable . Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms , certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases . Risk factors include cystic fibrosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma , diabetes , heart failure , a history of smoking , a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke , and a weak immune system . Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination . Chest X-ray , blood tests , and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis . The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community , hospital , or health care associated pneumonia . Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available . Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking . Treatment depends on the underlying cause . Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics .",
  "/wiki/Oliver_O._Howard": "Oliver Otis Howard ( November 8 , 1830 - October 26 , 1909 ) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War . As a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac , Howard lost his right arm while leading his men against Confederate forces at the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines in June 1862 , an action which later earned him the Medal of Honor . As a corps commander , he suffered two humiliating defeats at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg in May and July 1863 , but recovered from the setbacks as a successful corps and later army commander in the Western Theater . Known as the Christian general because he tried to base his policy decisions on his deep religious piety , he was given charge of the Freedmen 's Bureau in mid-1865 , with the mission of integrating the former slaves into Southern society and politics during the second phase of the Reconstruction Era . Howard took charge of labor policy , setting up a system that required freed people to work on former plantation land under pay scales fixed by the Bureau , on terms negotiated by the Bureau with white land owners . Howard 's Bureau was primarily responsible for the legal affairs of the freedmen . He attempted to protect freed blacks from hostile conditions , but lacked adequate power , and was repeatedly frustrated by President Andrew Johnson . Howard 's allies , the Radical Republicans , won control of Congress in the 1866 elections and imposed Radical Reconstruction , with the result that freedmen were given the vote . With the help and advice of the Bureau , freedmen joined Republican coalitions and won at the ballot boxes of most of the southern states . Howard was also a leader in promoting higher education for freedmen , most notably in founding Howard University in Washington and serving as its president 1867-73 . After 1874 , Howard commanded troops in the West , conducting a famous campaign against the Nez Perce tribe . Utley ( 1987 ) concludes that his leadership against the Apaches in 1872 , against the Nez Perce in 1877 , the Bannocks and Paiutes in 1878 , and against the Sheepeaters in 1879 all add up to a lengthy record , although he did not fight as much as George Custer and Nelson Miles .",
  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration 's creation , with over 40 % awarded for actions during the American Civil War .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Seven_Pines": "The Battle of Seven Pines , also known as the Battle of Fair Oaks or Fair Oaks Station , took place on May 31 and June 1 , 1862 , in Henrico County , Virginia , as part of the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War . It was the culmination of an offensive up the Virginia Peninsula by Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , in which the Army of the Potomac reached the outskirts of Richmond . On May 31 , Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston attempted to overwhelm two Federal corps that appeared isolated south of the Chickahominy River . The Confederate assaults , although not well coordinated , succeeded in driving back the IV Corps and inflicting heavy casualties . Reinforcements arrived , and both sides fed more and more troops into the action . Supported by the III Corps and Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick 's division of Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner 's II Corps ( which crossed the rain-swollen river on Grapevine Bridge ) , the Federal position was finally stabilized . Gen. Johnston was seriously wounded during the action , and command of the Confederate army devolved temporarily to Maj. Gen. G.W . Smith . On June 1 , the Confederates renewed their assaults against the Federals , who had brought up more reinforcements , but made little headway . Both sides claimed victory . Although the battle was tactically inconclusive , it was the largest battle in the Eastern Theater up to that time ( and second only to Shiloh in terms of casualties thus far , about 11,000 total ) . Gen. Johnston 's injury also had profound influence on the war : it led to the appointment of Robert E. Lee as Confederate commander .",
  "/wiki/Chief_Joseph": "Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt ( or Hinmat\u00f3owyalahtq\u0313it in Americanist orthography ) , popularly known as Chief Joseph , Young Joseph , or Joseph the Younger ( March 3 , 1840 - September 21 , 1904 ) , was a leader of the Wal-lam-wat-kain ( Wallowa ) band of Nez Perce , a Native American tribe of the interior Pacific Northwest region of the United States , in the latter half of the 19th century . He succeeded his father Tuekakas ( Chief Joseph the Elder ) in the early 1870s . Chief Joseph led his band of Nez Perce during the most tumultuous period in their history , when they were forcibly removed by the United States federal government from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley of northeastern Oregon onto a significantly reduced reservation in the Idaho Territory . A series of violent encounters with white settlers in the spring of 1877 culminated in those Nez Perce who resisted removal , including Joseph 's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe , to flee the United States in an attempt to reach political asylum alongside the Lakota people , who had sought refuge in Canada under the leadership of Sitting Bull . At least 700 men , women , and children led by Joseph and other Nez Perce chiefs were pursued by the U.S. Army under General Oliver O. Howard in a 1,170-mile ( 1,900 km ) fighting retreat known as the Nez Perce War . The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity earned them widespread admiration from their military opponents and the American public , and coverage of the war in U.S. newspapers led to popular recognition of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce . In October 1877 , after months of fugitive resistance , most of the surviving remnants of Joseph 's band were cornered in northern Montana Territory , just 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canadian border . Unable to fight any longer , Chief Joseph surrendered to the Army with the understanding that he and his people would be allowed to return to the reservation in western Idaho . He was instead transported between various forts and reservations on the southern Great Plains before being moved to the Colville Indian Reservation in the state of Washington , where he died in 1904 . Chief Joseph 's life remains iconic of the American Indian Wars . For his passionate , principled resistance to his tribe 's forced removal , Joseph became renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker .",

Members of the Sahaptin language group , the Niim\u00edipuu were the dominant people of the Columbia Plateau for much of that time , especially after acquiring the horses that led them to breed the appaloosa horse in the 18th century . Prior to first contact with Western civilization the Nimiipuu were economically and culturally influential in trade and war , interacting with other indigenous nations in a vast network from the western shores of Oregon and Washington , the high plains of Montana , and the northern Great Basin in southern Idaho and northern Nevada . After first contact , the name Nez Perce was given to the Niim\u00edipuu and the nearby Chinook people by French explorers and trappers . The name means pierced nose , but only the Chinook used that form of decoration . Today they are a federally recognized tribe , the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho , and govern their Indian reservation in Idaho through a central government headquartered in Lapwai , Idaho known as the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee ( NPTEC ) . They are one of five federally recognized tribes in the state of Idaho . Some still speak their traditional language , and the Tribe owns and operates two casinos along the Clearwater River in Idaho in Kamiah , Idaho and outside of Lewiston , Idaho , health clinics , a police force and court , community centers , salmon fisheries , radio station , and other things that promote economic and cultural self-determination . Cut off from most of their horticultural sites throughout the Camas Prairie by an 1863 treaty , confinement to reservations in Idaho , Washington and Oklahoma Indian Territory after the Nez Perce War of 1877 , and Dawes Act of 1887 land allotments ( today some Nez Perce lease land to farmers or loggers , but the Nez Perce only own 12 % of their own reservation ) , the Nez Perce remain as a distinct culture and political economic influence within and outside their reservation . Today , hatching , harvesting and eating salmon is an important cultural and economic strength of the Nez Perce through full ownership or co-management of various salmon fish hatcheries , such as the Kooskia National Fish Hatchery in Kooskia , Idaho or the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery in Orofino , Idaho .",

He commanded the Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until its surrender in 1865 . A son of Revolutionary War officer Henry Light Horse Harry Lee III , Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years . During this time , he served throughout the United States , distinguished himself during the Mexican-American War , and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy . He was also the husband of Mary Anna Custis Lee , adopted great granddaughter of George Washington . When Virginia 's 1861 Richmond Convention declared secession from the Union , Lee chose to follow his home state , despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command . During the first year of the Civil War , he served as a senior military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis . Once he took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862 , he soon emerged as an able tactician and battlefield commander , winning most of his battles , nearly all against far larger Union armies . Lee 's two major strategic offensives into Union territory ended in defeat . His aggressive tactics , especially at the Battle of Gettysburg , which resulted in high casualties at a time when the Confederacy had a shortage of manpower , have come under criticism in recent years . Lee surrendered the remnant of his army to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 . Since Confederate Congress had appointed him supreme commander of Confederate armies , the remaining Confederate forces capitulated after his surrender .",

  "/wiki/American_Indian_Wars": "The American Indian Wars ( also known as the Indian Wars or the First Nations Wars ; French : Guerres des Premi\u00e8res Nations ) is the collective name for the various armed conflicts that were fought by European governments and colonists , and later by the governments and settlers , against various American Indian and First Nation tribes . These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century . The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors , including cultural clashes , land disputes , and criminal acts committed by both sides . The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other 's colonial settlements . After the American Revolution , many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use ; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal . In Canada , 11 Numbered Treaties covering most of the First Nations lands limited the number of such conflicts . As settlers spread westward across America and Canada after 1780 , armed conflicts increased in size , duration , and intensity between settlers and various Indian and First Nation tribes . The climax came in the War of 1812 , when major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South fought against the United States and lost . Conflict with settlers became much less common and was usually resolved by treaty , often through sale or exchange of territory between the federal government and specific tribes . The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the American government to enforce the Indian removal from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the American frontier , especially Oklahoma . The federal policy of removal was eventually refined in the West , as American settlers kept expanding their territories , to relocate Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected and subsidized reservations .",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south .

Its futility was predicted by the charge 's commander , Lt. Gen.
