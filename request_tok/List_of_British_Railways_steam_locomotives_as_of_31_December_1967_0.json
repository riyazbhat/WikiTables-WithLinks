  "/wiki/Wheel_arrangement": "In rail transport , a wheel arrangement or wheel configuration is a system of classifying the way in which wheels are distributed under a locomotive . Several notations exist to describe the wheel assemblies of a locomotive by type , position , and connections , with the adopted notations varying by country . Within a given country , different notations may also be employed for different kinds of locomotives , such as steam , electric , and diesel powered . Especially in steam days , wheel arrangement was an important attribute of a locomotive because there were many different types of layout adopted , each wheel being optimised for a different use ( often with only some being actually driven ) . Modern diesel and electric locomotives are much more uniform , usually with all axles driven",

  "/wiki/LMS_Stanier_Class_5_4-6-0": "The London Midland and Scottish Railway Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 , commonly known as the Black Five , is a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotives . It was introduced by William Stanier in 1934 and 842 were built between then and 1951 . Several members of the class survived to the last day of steam on British Railways in 1968 , and eighteen are preserved",
  "/wiki/4-6-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement , 4-6-0 represents the configuration of four leading wheels on two axles in a leading bogie , six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels . In the mid 19th century , this wheel arrangement became the second most popular configuration for new steam locomotives in the United States of America , where this type is commonly referred to as a Ten-wheeler . As a locomotive pulling trains of lightweight all wood passenger cars in the 1890-1920s , it was exceptionally stable at near 100 mph speeds on the New York Central 's New York to Chicago Water Level Route and on the Reading Railroad 's Camden to Atlantic City , NJ , line . As passenger equipment grew heavier with all steel construction , heavier locomotives replaced the Ten Wheeler",
  "/wiki/LMS_Stanier_Class_8F": "The London Midland and Scottish Railway 's 8F class 2-8-0 heavy freight locomotive is a class of steam locomotive designed for hauling heavy freight . 852 were built between 1935 and 1946 ( not all to LMS order ) , as a freight version of William Stanier 's successful Black Five , and the class saw extensive service overseas during and after the Second World War",
  "/wiki/2-8-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 2-8-0 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle , usually in a leading truck , eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles , and no trailing wheels . In the United States and elsewhere , this wheel arrangement is commonly known as a Consolidation , after the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroads Consolidation , the name of the first 2-8-0 . The Consolidation represented a notable advance in locomotive power . After 1875 , it became the most popular type of freight locomotive in the United States and was built in greater quantities than any other single wheel arrangement",
  "/wiki/LMS_Ivatt_Class_4": "The LMS Ivatt Class 4 2-6-0 is a class of steam locomotive primarily designed for medium freight work but also widely used on secondary passenger services . The London Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) built 162 of this type between 1947 and 1952 , but only three were built by the LMS before nationalisation in 1948 . Designed by H.G . Ivatt , they were classified 4F by the LMS and 4MT by BR . In BR days they were used extensively across the system , being prevalent on the London Midland region and to a lesser extent elsewhere , notably on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway , an East Anglian line that had previously been joint owned by the LMS and LNER , where they became the dominant locomotive type . They were also used for a short period on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway , but were quickly transferred elsewhere , never to return , because of poor steaming on the line 's long and steep gradients - this was before modifications were made to the design which improved steaming notably",

  "/wiki/BR_Standard_Class_7": "The BR Standard Class 7 , otherwise known as the Britannia Class , is a class of 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotive designed under Robert Riddles for use by British Railways for mixed traffic duties . 55 were constructed between 1951 and 1954 . The design employed results from the 1948 locomotive exchanges undertaken in advance of further locomotive classes being constructed . Three batches were constructed at Crewe Works , before the publication of the 1955 Modernisation Plan . The Britannia Class design was based on best practice from the pre-nationalisation railway companies in terms of operating efficiency and lower maintenance costs ; various weight-saving measures also increased the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive on the British Railways network . The Britannias received a positive reception from their crews , with those regularly operating the locomotives giving them favourable reports as regards performance . However , operation in some areas of the British Railway network returned negative feedback , primarily due to indifferent operation of the locomotive , with its effects on adhering to timetables . The Britannias took their names from great Britons , former Star class locomotives , and Scottish firths . The class remained in service until the last was withdrawn in 1968 . Two survived into preservation , the first-of-class , number 70000 Britannia , and 70013 Oliver Cromwell . Number 70000 has hauled mainline excursions and 70013 , after a period of display following limited steaming , returned to mainline steam in 2008 for the first time since leaving British Railways ownership . 70000 was returned to the main line in 2011",

  "/wiki/BR_Standard_Class_9F": "The British Railways BR Standard Class 9F 2-10-0 is a class of steam locomotive designed for British Railways by Robert Riddles . The Class 9F was the last in a series of standardised locomotive classes designed for British Railways during the 1950s , and was intended for use on fast , heavy freight trains over long distances . It was one of the most powerful steam locomotive types ever constructed in Britain , and successfully performed its intended duties . The class was given the nickname of 'Spaceships ' , due to its size and shape . In profile , daylight can be seen between the frames and the boiler . At various times during the 1950s , the 9Fs worked passenger trains with great success , indicating the versatility of the design , sometimes considered to represent the ultimate in British steam development . Several experimental variants were constructed in an effort to reduce costs and maintenance , although these met with varying degrees of success . The total number built was 251 , production being shared between Swindon ( 53 ) and Crewe Works ( 198 ) . The last of the class , 92220 Evening Star , was the final steam locomotive to be built by British Railways , in 1960 . Withdrawals began in 1964 , with the final locomotives removed from service in 1968 . Several examples have survived into the preservation era in varying states of repair , including Evening Star",
  "/wiki/2-10-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 2-10-0 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle , ten powered and coupled driving wheels on five axles , and no trailing wheels . This arrangement was often named Decapod , especially in the United States , although this name was sometimes applied to locomotives of 0-10-0 Ten-Coupled arrangement , particularly in the United Kingdom . Notable German locomotives of this type include the war locomotives of Class 52 . These locomotives were popular in Europe , particularly in Germany and Russia ; British use of the type was confined to the period during and after World War II . In the United States , the 2-10-0 was not widely popular but was a favorite of a small number of railroads which operated mostly in mountainous terrain . Among these was the Erie Railroad , a major Chicago to New York trunk line railroad . The 2-10-0 's main advantage was that five out of six of its axles were powered , meaning almost all the weight was available for traction rather than being distributed over pilot and trailing wheels . The long rigid wheelbase caused problems on tightly curved track , so blind drivers were the norm , either on the central axle , and/or on the second and/or fourth axles . Often lateral motion devices were attached to the leading drive axle . The wheel arrangement 's disadvantages included the firebox size restriction caused by the lack of trailing wheel . This meant the firebox was fitted in between the wheels ( common on earlier locomotives ) and was long and narrow , or if mounted above the driving wheels , was wide and long but shallow . Many locomotives chose the latter option",
