It consists of 47 contributing properties . Greensburg was founded in 1794 . The town site was originally called Glover 's Station , named after its founder John Glover in 1779 . [ citation needed ] The name change was due to the founding of Green County , and renaming the town to reflect the county 's name . The county name was to honor American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene . Due to their proximity to the Cumberland Trace , the town and the county grew rapidly . Green County 's population jumped from 1,000 in 1790 to 6,096 in 1800 , 6,735 in 1810 , and 11,943 in 1820 , with its highest population being 14,212 in 1840 , when the county included what is now Taylor County . Most of the buildings in the district are of Federal or Greek Revival architectural style . Due to the heyday of the town and county being between 1794 and 1840 , almost all the outstanding architecture is pre-1840 , as after that year the population decreased in favor of other areas in Kentucky , as the Cumberland Trace gave way to railroads and steamboats for transportation . Although it escaped any conflict during the Civil War , it still was impacted by the economic downturn felt by the rest of Kentucky after the War . It also means that the basic structure of Kentucky seats built around 1800 is largely intact",
