  "/wiki/Alice_Holt_Forest": "Alice Holt Forest is a royal forest in Hampshire , situated some 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) south of Farnham , Surrey . Once predominantly an ancient oak forest , it was particularly noted in the 18th and 19th centuries for the timber it supplied for the building of ships for the Royal Navy . It is now planted mainly with conifers . The Forestry Commission took over the management of the forest in 1924 , and a research station was set up in 1946 in the Alice Holt Lodge , a former manor house . The forest is now part of the South Downs National Park , which was established on 31 March 2010 , and it forms the most northerly gateway to the park .",

The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest . Hampshire played a crucial military role in both World Wars . The Isle of Wight , historically part of Hampshire , became a separate ceremonial county in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/Royal_forest": "A royal forest , occasionally Kingswood , is an area of land with different definitions in England , Wales , and Scotland . The term forest in the ordinary modern understanding refers to an area of wooded land ; however , the original medieval sense was closer to the modern idea of a preserve - i.e . land legally set aside for specific purposes such as royal hunting - with less emphasis on its composition . There are also differing and contextual interpretations in Continental Europe derived from the Carolingian and Merovingian legal systems . In Anglo-Saxon England , though the kings were great huntsmen they never set aside areas declared to be outside ( Latin foris ) the law of the land . Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs ( c. 500 to 1066 ) creating forests . However , under the Norman kings ( after 1066 ) , by royal prerogative forest law was widely applied . The law was designed to protect the venison and the vert , the noble animals of the chase - notably red and fallow deer , the roe deer , and the wild boar - and the greenery that sustained them . Forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or ( by invitation ) the aristocracy ( see medieval hunting ) . The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century , and at the height of this practice in the late 12th and early 13th centuries , fully one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest ; at one stage in the 12th century , all of Essex was afforested , and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire forest . Afforestation , in particular the creation of the New Forest , figured large in the folk history of the Norman yoke , which magnified what was already a grave social ill : the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted , houses burned , peasants evicted , all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant , is a familiar element in the English national story . The extent and intensity of hardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated , H. R. Loyn observed .",
  "/wiki/Forest_Research": "The Forestry Commission is a non-ministerial government department responsible for the management of publicly-owned forests , and the regulation of both public and private forestry , in England . It was formerly also responsible for Forestry in Wales and Scotland , however on 1 April 2013 Forestry Commission Wales merged with other agencies to become Natural Resources Wales , whilst two new bodies ( Forestry and Land Scotland and Scottish Forestry ) were established in Scotland on 1 April 2019 . The commission was set up in 1919 to expand Britain 's forests and woodland after depletion during the First World War . To do this , the commission bought large amounts of former agricultural land , eventually becoming the largest land owner in Britain . The Commission is divided into three divisions : Forestry England , Forestry Commission and Forest Research . Over time the purpose of the Commission broadened to include many other activities beyond timber production . One major activity is scientific research , some of which is carried out in research forests across Britain . Recreation is also important , with several outdoor activities being actively promoted . Protecting and improving biodiversity across England 's forests are also part of the Forestry Commission 's remit . The Commission received criticism for its reliance on conifers , particularly the uniform appearance of conifer forests and concerns over a lack of biodiversity . Protests from the general public and conservation groups accompanied attempts to privatise the organisation in 1993 and 2010 .",

  "/wiki/Conifer": "The Pinophyta , also known as Coniferophyta or Coniferae , or commonly as conifers , are a division of vascular land plants containing a single extant class , Pinopsida . They are gymnosperms , cone-bearing seed plants . All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary growth . The great majority are trees , though a few are shrubs . Examples include cedars , Douglas firs , cypresses , firs , junipers , kauri , larches , pines , hemlocks , redwoods , spruces , and yews . As of 1998 , the division Pinophyta was estimated to contain eight families , 68 genera , and 629 living species . [ citation needed ] Although the total number of species is relatively small , conifers are ecologically important . They are the dominant plants over large areas of land , most notably the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere , but also in similar cool climates in mountains further south . Boreal conifers have many wintertime adaptations . The narrow conical shape of northern conifers , and their downward-drooping limbs , help them shed snow . Many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing .

  "/wiki/Bernwood_Forest": "Bernwood Forest was one of several forests of the ancient Kingdom of England and was a Royal hunting forest . It is thought to have been set aside as Royal hunting land when the Anglo-Saxon kings had a palace at Brill and church in Oakley , in the 10th century and was a particularly favoured place of Edward the Confessor , who was born in nearby Islip . From about 1217 through to the 17th century the forest went through a gradual period of deforestation . King Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) prepared a map of the forest at the time which is an invaluable tool in helping define its ancient boundaries ; however , his purpose for drawing up the map was to divide the forest amongst his nobles . By the 16th century , another map of the forest had been drawn up by which time it had been reduced greatly in size . Again , the map was drawn up under the aegis of the Crown as an audit to what revenue could be made from selling off the forest . By the reign of King James I ( reigned 1603-1625 ) , the forest had lost its Royal status and had completely disappeared . Today the name refers to the area of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire where the forest was at the time of King Henry II , covering 400 km\u00b2 . The approximate boundaries of the designated area today fall within the River Great Ouse , the Padbury Brook , the Claydon Brook and the River Thame .

  "/wiki/Forest_of_Dean": "The Forest of Dean is a geographical , historical and cultural region in the western part of the county of Gloucestershire , England . It forms a roughly triangular plateau bounded by the River Wye to the west and northwest , Herefordshire to the north , the River Severn to the south , and the City of Gloucester to the east . The area is characterised by more than 110 square kilometres ( 42 sq mi ) of mixed woodland , one of the surviving ancient woodlands in England . A large area was reserved for royal hunting before 1066 , and remained as the second largest crown forest in England , the largest being New Forest . Although the name is used loosely to refer to the part of Gloucestershire between the Severn and Wye , the Forest of Dean proper has covered a much smaller area since the Middle Ages . In 1327 it was defined to cover only the royal demesne and parts of parishes within the hundred of St Briavels , and after 1668 comprised the royal demesne only . The Forest proper is within the civil parishes of West Dean , Lydbrook , Cinderford , Ruspidge , and Drybrook , together with a strip of land in the parish of English Bicknor . Traditionally the main sources of work have been forestry - including charcoal production - iron working and coal mining . Archaeological studies have dated the earliest use of coal to Roman times for domestic heating and industrial processes such as the preparation of iron ore . The area gives its name to the local government district , Forest of Dean , and a parliamentary constituency , both of which cover wider areas than the historic Forest . The administrative centre of the local authority is Coleford , one of the main towns in the historic Forest area , together with Cinderford and Lydney .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_forest": "An old-growth forest - also termed primary forest , virgin forest , primeval forest , late seral forest , or forest primeval - is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community . Old-growth features include diverse tree-related structures that provide diverse wildlife habitat that increases the biodiversity of the forested ecosystem . The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps , greatly varying tree heights and diameters , and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris . Old-growth forests are valuable for economic reasons and for the ecosystem services they provide . This can be a point of contention when some in the logging industry desire to cut down the forests to obtain valuable timber , while environmentalists seek to preserve the forests for benefits such as maintenance of biodiversity , water purification , flood control , and nutrient cycling . Proforestation - the practice of purposefully growing an existing forest intact toward its full ecological potential - aims to promote old-growth forests .",

  "/wiki/South_Downs": "The South Downs are a range of chalk hills that extends for about 260 square miles ( 670 km2 ) across the south-eastern coastal counties of England from the Itchen Valley of Hampshire in the west to Beachy Head , in the Eastbourne Downland Estate , East Sussex , in the east . The Downs are bounded on the northern side by a steep escarpment , from whose crest there are extensive views northwards across the Weald . The South Downs National Park forms a much larger area than the chalk range of the South Downs and includes large parts of the Weald . The South Downs are characterised by rolling chalk downland with close-cropped turf and dry valleys , and are recognised as one of the most important chalk landscapes in England . The range is one of the four main areas of chalk downland in southern England . The South Downs are relatively less populated compared to South East England as a whole , although there has been large-scale urban encroachment onto the chalk downland by major seaside resorts , including most notably Brighton and Hove . The South Downs have been inhabited since ancient times and at periods the area has supported a large population , particularly during Romano-British times . There is a rich heritage of historical features and archaeological remains , including defensive sites , burial mounds and field boundaries . Within the South Downs Environmentally Sensitive Area there are thirty-seven Sites of Special Scientific Interest , including large areas of chalk grassland . The grazing of sheep on the thin , well-drained chalk soils of the Downs over many centuries and browsing by rabbits resulted in the fine , short , springy turf , known as old chalk grassland , that has come to epitomise the South Downs today . Until the middle of the 20th century , an agricultural system operated by downland farmers known as 'sheep-and-corn farming ' underpinned this : the sheep ( most famously the Southdown breed ) of villagers would be systematically confined to certain corn fields to improve their fertility with their droppings and then they would be let out onto the downland to graze . However , starting in 1940 with government measures during World War II to increase domestic food production and continuing into the 1950s , much grassland was ploughed up for arable farming , fundamentally changing the landscape and ecology , with the loss of much biodiversity .",
