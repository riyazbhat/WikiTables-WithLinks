Female birds are less brightly colored than males , although color patterns are similar and there is no noticeable difference in size between the two sexes .",
  "/wiki/Bird_migration": "Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement , often north and south along a flyway , between breeding and wintering grounds . Many species of bird migrate . Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality , including from hunting by humans , and is driven primarily by availability of food . It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere , where birds are funneled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea . Migration of species such as storks , turtle doves , and swallows was recorded as many as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors , including Homer and Aristotle , and in the Book of Job . More recently , Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749 , and modern scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking to trace migrants . Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites , as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms . The Arctic tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds , travelling between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year . Some species of tubenoses ( Procellariiformes ) such as albatrosses circle the earth , flying over the southern oceans , while others such as Manx shearwaters migrate 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean . Shorter migrations are common , including altitudinal migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas . The timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length . Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars , the earth 's magnetic field , and mental maps .",

  "/wiki/Square_dance": "A square dance is a dance for four couples ( eight dancers in total ) arranged in a square , with one couple on each side , facing the middle of the square . Square dances were first documented in 16th-century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe . They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there . In some countries and regions , through preservation and repetition , square dances have attained the status of a folk dance . The Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide , possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American cowboy . Square dancing is , therefore , strongly associated with the United States . Nineteen U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance . The various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries . Some of these traditional dances include English country dance , Caledonians and the quadrille . In most American forms of square dance , the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps ( square dance choreography ) by a caller to the beat ( and , in some traditions , the phrasing ) of music . In some forms of traditional square dancing , the caller may be one of the dancers or musicians , but in modern Western square dancing the caller will be on stage , giving full attention to directing the dancers . Modern Western square dances are not learned as complete routines ; the dancers learn basic movements , each with its own distinctive call , but do not know in what order they will be called .",

As a member of the genus Oncorhynchus , it is one of the Pacific trout , a group that includes the widely distributed rainbow trout . Cutthroat trout are popular gamefish , especially among anglers who enjoy fly fishing . The common name cutthroat refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the lower jaw . The specific name clarkii was given to honor explorer William Clark , coleader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large , clear , well-oxygenated , shallow rivers with gravel bottoms . They reproduce in clear , cold , moderately deep lakes . They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the rivers of the Pacific basin , Great Basin and Rocky Mountains . Cutthroat trout spawn in the spring and may inadvertently but naturally hybridize with rainbow trout , producing fertile cutbows . Some populations of the coastal cutthroat trout ( O. c. clarkii ) are semi-anadromous . Several subspecies of cutthroat trout are currently listed as threatened in their native ranges due to habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species . Two subspecies , O. c. alvordensis and O. c. macdonaldi , are considered extinct .",

  "/wiki/Domestication": "Domestication is a sustained multi-generational relationship in which one group of organisms assumes a significant degree of influence over the reproduction and care of another group to secure a more predictable supply of resources from that second group . Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors . He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits , and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits . There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations . There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication , and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations . Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates , and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant , whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates , though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations . The dog was the first domesticated vertebrate , and was established across Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era , well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals . The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks - including donkeys , horses , New and Old World camelids , goats , sheep , and pigs - was common . Given its importance to humans and its value as a model of evolutionary and demographic change , domestication has attracted scientists from archaeology , paleontology , anthropology , botany , zoology , genetics , and the environmental sciences . Among birds , the major domestic species today is the chicken , important for meat and eggs , though economically valuable poultry include the turkey , guineafowl and numerous other species . Birds are also widely kept as cagebirds , from songbirds to parrots . The longest established invertebrate domesticates are the honey bee and the silkworm .",

  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_horses": "Twelve U.S. states have designated a horse breed as the official state horse . The first state horse was designated in Vermont in 1961 . The most recent state designations occurred in 2010 , when North Carolina and South Carolina both declared state breeds . There have been proposals to designate a state horse in Oregon as well as in Arizona ( where an ongoing campaign sought to designate the Colonial Spanish Horse as the state horse prior to the state centennial in 2012 ) , but neither proposal is yet successful . In one state , North Dakota , the state horse is officially designated the honorary state equine . Two additional states have not designated a specific state horse , but have designed a horse or horse breed as its official state animals : the horse in New Jersey and the Morgan horse breed in Vermont . Some breeds , such as the American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan horse in Vermont and Massachusetts , were named as the state horse because of the close connection between the history of the breed and the state . Others , including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter , include the state in the official breed name . School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses , such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks , while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries . Official state horses are one of many state symbols officially designated by states .

  "/wiki/Appaloosa": "The Appaloosa is an American horse breed best known for its colorful spotted coat pattern . There is a wide range of body types within the breed , stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history . Each horse 's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors . The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics , as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation ( LP ) . Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness ; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex . Artwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric cave paintings in Europe . Images of domesticated horses with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from Ancient Greece and Han dynasty China through the early modern period . In North America , the Nez Perce people of what today is the United States Pacific Northwest developed the original American breed . Settlers once referred to these spotted horses as the Palouse horse , possibly after the Palouse River , which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country . Gradually , the name evolved into Appaloosa . The Nez Perce lost most of their horses after the Nez Perce War in 1877 , and the breed fell into decline for several decades . A small number of dedicated breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the Appaloosa Horse Club ( ApHC ) was formed as the breed registry in 1938 .",

In the past , this meant that senators represented various geographic regions within a state , regardless of the population , as a way of balancing the power of the lower house , which was apportioned according to population . This system changed in 1963 , when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must apportion seats in both houses according to population . However , the single-member district system remained , and as a result , the State Senates became redundant bodies , as other solutions , such as abolition ( as in Canada ) or switching to statewide proportional representation ( as in Australia ) were not considered .

A large , crow-sized falcon , it has a blue-grey back , barred white underparts , and a black head . The Peregrine is renowned for its speed , reaching over 320 km/h ( 200 mph ) during its characteristic hunting stoop ( high-speed dive ) , making it the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom . According to a National Geographic TV program , the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h ( 242 mph ) . As is typical of bird-eating raptors , peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic , with females being considerably larger than males . According to one study , it has the fastest visual processing speed of any animal tested so far , and can register discrete changes up to 129 Hz or cycles per second . As an analogy , film is a series of still images projected onto a screen . Those still images need to be changing at roughly 25 frames per second before humans see them as fluid and no longer as individual , discrete pictures . The film would have to be refreshing at 129 frames per second before peregrine falcons stopped seeing flashing , still images and started seeing fluid motion . The peregrine 's breeding range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics . It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth , except extreme polar regions , very high mountains , and most tropical rainforests ; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand .

  "/wiki/Bird_of_prey": "Birds of prey or raptors include species of bird that primarily hunt and feed on vertebrates that are large relative to the hunter . Additionally , they have keen eyesight for detecting food at a distance or during flight , strong feet equipped with talons for grasping or killing prey , and powerful , curved beaks for tearing flesh . The term raptor is derived from the Latin word rapio , meaning to seize or take by force . In addition to hunting live prey , most also eat carrion , at least occasionally , and vultures and condors eat carrion as their main food source . Although the term bird of prey could theoretically be taken to include all birds that primarily consume animals , ornithologists typically use the narrower definition followed in this page . [ citation needed ] Examples of animal-eating birds not encompassed by the ornithological definition include storks , herons , gulls , skuas , penguins , kookaburras , and shrikes , as well as the many songbirds that are primarily insectivorous .",

  "/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_songs": "Forty-nine of the fifty U.S. states that make up the United States of America have one or more state songs , a type of regional anthem , which are selected by each state legislature , and/or state governor , as a symbol ( or emblem ) of that particular U.S. state . Some U.S. states have more than one official state song , and may refer to some of their official songs by other names ; for example , Arkansas officially has two state songs , plus a state anthem , and a state historical song . Tennessee has the most state songs , with 9 official state songs and an official bicentennial rap . Arizona has a song that was written specifically as a state anthem in 1915 , as well as the 1981 country hit Arizona , which it adopted as the alternate state anthem in 1982 . Two individuals , Stephen Foster , and John Denver , have written or co-written two state songs . Foster 's two state songs , Old Folks at Home ( better known as Swanee Ribber or Suwannee River ) , adopted by Florida , and My Old Kentucky Home are among the best-known songs in the U.S. On March 12 , 2007 , the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make Denver 's trademark 1972 hit Rocky Mountain High one of the state 's two official state songs , sharing duties with its predecessor , Where the Columbines Grow . On March 7 , 2014 , the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make Denver 's Take Me Home , Country Roads one of four official state songs of West Virginia . Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed the resolution into law on March 8 , 2014 . Additionally , Woody Guthrie wrote or co-wrote two state folk songs - Roll On , Columbia , Roll On and Oklahoma Hills - but they have separate status from the official state songs of Washington and Oklahoma , respectively . Other well-known state songs include Yankee Doodle , You Are My Sunshine , Rocky Top , and Home on the Range ; a number of others are popular standards , including Oklahoma ( from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ) , Hoagy Carmichael 's Georgia on My Mind , Tennessee Waltz , Missouri Waltz , and On the Banks of the Wabash , Far Away . Many of the others are much less well-known , especially outside the state . New Jersey has no official state song , while Virginia 's previous state song , Carry Me Back to Old Virginny , adopted in 1940 , was later rescinded in 1997 due to its racist language by the Virginia General Assembly .",

The song was popular then , and Bessee had no idea of its origin . This song won the annual university prize for that year and eventually became the university 's alma mater . Albert J. Tompkins , Director of Music in the Boise Public Schools , wrote a set of verses for the song . In 1931 , the Idaho Legislature designated Here We Have Idaho , previously known at the University of Idaho as Our Idaho , as the Idaho state song .",

  "/wiki/Idaho_Panhandle": "The Idaho Panhandle - locally known as North Idaho - is a region in the U.S. state of Idaho encompassing the state 's 10 northernmost counties : Benewah , Bonner , Boundary , Clearwater , Idaho , Kootenai , Latah , Lewis , Nez Perce , and Shoshone ( though the southern part of the region is sometimes referred to as North Central Idaho ) . The Panhandle is bordered by the state of Washington to the west , Montana to the east , and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north . The Idaho panhandle , along with Eastern Washington , comprises the region known as the Inland Northwest . Coeur d'Alene is the largest city within the Idaho Panhandle . Spokane , Washington is around 30 miles ( 48 km ) west of Coeur d'Alene , and is also the location of the regional airport , Spokane International Airport . Other important cities in the region include Lewiston , Moscow , Post Falls , Hayden , Sandpoint , and the smaller towns of St. Maries and Bonners Ferry . East of Coeur d'Alene is the Silver Valley , which follows Interstate 90 to the Montana border at Lookout Pass . The region has a land area of 21,012.64 square miles ( 54,422.5 km2 ) , around 25.4% of the state 's total land area ; there is also 323.95 square miles ( 839.0 km2 ) of water area . As of the 2010 Census , the population of the Idaho Panhandle was 317,751 , around 20.3% of the state 's total population of 1,567,582 . The Idaho Panhandle observes Pacific Time north of the western-flowing Salmon River in the southern part of Idaho County . The rest of the state to the south observes Mountain Time , which begins at Riggins . Though the Idaho Panhandle is at the same longitude as southern Idaho , the reasons for the different time zones are : ( 1 ) because Spokane is the commercial and transportation center for the region , and ( 2 ) there are many cross-border towns and cities that are connected , led by Spokane with Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls , followed by Pullman ( home of Washington State University ) with Moscow ( home of the University of Idaho ) , and Clarkston with Lewiston .",
  "/wiki/Potato": "The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas , a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum , and the plant itself , a perennial in the family Solanaceae . Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas , from the United States to southern Chile . The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations , but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes . In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia , from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex , potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000-10,000 years ago . In the Andes region of South America , where the species is indigenous , some close relatives of the potato are cultivated . Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish . Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world 's food supply . As of 2014 , potatoes were the world 's fourth-largest food crop after maize ( corn ) , wheat , and rice . Following millennia of selective breeding , there are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes . Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile , which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes . The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing . It remains an essential crop in Europe , especially Northern and Eastern Europe , where per capita production is still the highest in the world , while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia , with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2014 ."
