Willcox and Clarence H. Johnston Sr . The house , at 599 Summit Avenue , is listed as a National Historic Landmark for its association with author F. Scott Fitzgerald . The design of the rowhouse was called the New York Style , where each unit was given a distinctive character similar to rowhouses in eastern cities . Architecture critic Larry Millett describes it as A brownstone row house that leaves no Victorian style unaccounted for , although the general flavor is Romanesque Revival . The Fitzgerald house is a brownstone two bays wide , with a polygonal two-story window bay on the right , and the entrance , recessed under a round arch that is flush with the bay front , on the left . At the mansarded roof level there is a gable with two round-arch windows and decorative finials . Fitzgerald 's parents , Edward and Mollie , moved back to St. Paul in 1914 while F. Scott Fitzgerald was a student at Princeton University . They lived in the unit at 593 Summit Avenue for a while , then moved to the 599 Summit Avenue unit in 1918 .

  "/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby": "The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval and excess , creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary [ a ] tale regarding the American Dream . Fitzgerald - inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's North Shore - began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , something new - something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referred to the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue . First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly . In its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten . However , the novel experienced a revival during World War II , and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades . Today , The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel .",

  "/wiki/Military": "A military is a heavily armed , highly organised force primarily intended for warfare , also known collectively as armed forces . It is typically officially authorized and maintained by a sovereign state , with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform . It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army , navy , air force , space force , marines , or coast guard . The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats . In broad usage , the terms armed forces and military are often treated as synonymous , although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country 's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces . There are various forms of irregular military forces , not belonging to a recognized state ; though they share many attributes with regular military forces , they are less often referred to as simply military .",
  "/wiki/Fortification": "A fortification is a military construction or building designed for the defense of territories in warfare , and is also used to solidify rule in a region during peacetime . The term is derived from the Latin fortis ( strong ) and facere ( to make ) . From very early history to modern times , defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest . Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified . In ancient Greece , large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece , such as the ancient site of Mycenae ( famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean ' walls ) . A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison , and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or English fortress . These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower , to guard certain roads , passes , and borders . Though smaller than a real fortress , they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border . The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called castrametation since the time of the Roman legions . Fortification is usually divided into two branches : permanent fortification and field fortification . There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification . Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory .",
  "/wiki/Confluence_(geography)": "In geography , a confluence ( also : conflux ) occurs where two or more flowing bodies of water join together to form a single channel . A confluence can occur in several configurations : at the point where a tributary joins a larger river ( main stem ) ; or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name ( such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers at Pittsburgh , forming the Ohio ) ; or where two separated channels of a river ( forming a river island ) rejoin at the downstream end .",

It drains a watershed of nearly 17,000 square miles ( 44,000 km2 ) , 14,751 square miles ( 38,200 km2 ) in Minnesota and about 2,000 sq mi ( 5,200 km2 ) in South Dakota and Iowa . It rises in southwestern Minnesota , in Big Stone Lake on the Minnesota-South Dakota border just south of the Laurentian Divide at the Traverse Gap portage . It flows southeast to Mankato , then turns northeast . It joins the Mississippi south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul , near the historic Fort Snelling . The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota . The name Minnesota comes from the Dakota language phrase , Mnisota Makoce which is translated to land where the waters reflect the sky , as a reference to the many lakes in Minnesota rather than the cloudiness of the actual river . For over a century prior to the organization of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 , the name St. Pierre ( St. Peter ) had been generally applied to the river by French and English explorers and writers . Minnesota River is shown on the 1757 edition of Mitchell Map as Ouadebameni\u017fsout\u00e9 [ Watp\u00e1 Mn\u00edsota ] or R. St. Peter . On June 19 , 1852 , acting upon a request from the Minnesota territorial legislature , the United States Congress decreed the aboriginal name for the river , Minnesota , to be the rivers official name and ordered all agencies of the federal government to use that name when referencing it . The valley that the Minnesota River flows in is up to five miles ( 8 km ) wide and 250 feet ( 80 m ) deep . It was carved into the landscape by the massive glacial River Warren between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago at the end of the last ice age in North America .",
  "/wiki/Mississippi_River": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system . From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",

The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is a long name and therefore is frequently referred to as MNRRA ( often pronounced like minnra ) or MISS ( the four letter code assigned to the park by the National Park Service ) . The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area ( MISS ) was established in 1988 as a new unique type of National Park known as a partnership park . Unlike traditional national parks , MISS is not a major land owner and therefore does not have control over land use . MISS works with dozens of partners ( local , state , and federal governments , non-profits , businesses , educational institutions , and individuals ) who own land along the river or who have an interest in the Mississippi River to achieve the National Park Service 's mission to protect and preserve for future generations .

The Hull-Rust-Mahoning Mine was named a National Historic Landmark in 1966 . The city of Hibbing has long maintained a public overlook and visitor center on the rim of the mine , attracting tens of thousands of tourists each year . In 2019 , the overlook was to be moved as mining operations expand .",

  "/wiki/Open-pit_mining": "Open-pit , open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth , such as long wall mining . Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface . It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling ( as would be the case for sand , cinder , and gravel ) . In contrast , minerals that have been found underground but are difficult to retrieve due to hard rock , can be reached using a form of underground mining . To create an open-pit mine , the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground . This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground , then plotting each hole location on a map . The information gained through the holes with provide an idea of the vertical extent of the ore 's body . This vertical information is then used to pit tentative locations of the benches that will occur in the mine . It is important to consider the grade and economic value of the ore in the potential pit . Open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as quarries . Open-pit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted , or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic .",
  "/wiki/Mesabi_Range": "The Mesabi Iron Range is an elongate trend containing large deposits of iron ore , and the largest of four major iron ranges in the region collectively known as the Iron Range of Minnesota . Discovered in 1866 , it is the chief iron ore mining district in the United States . The district is located in northeast Minnesota , largely in Itasca and Saint Louis counties . It was extensively worked in the earlier part of the 20th century . Extraction operations declined throughout the mid-1970s but rebounded in 2005 . China 's growing demand for iron , along with the falling value of the U.S. dollar versus other world currencies , have made taconite production profitable again , and some mines that had closed have been reopened , while current mines have been expanded .",
  "/wiki/Iron_ore": "Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted . The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey , bright yellow , or deep purple to rusty red . The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite ( Fe3O4 , 72.4% Fe ) , hematite ( Fe2O3 , 69.9% Fe ) , goethite ( FeO ( OH ) , 62.9% Fe ) , limonite ( FeO ( OH ) \u00b7n ( H2O ) , 55% Fe ) or siderite ( FeCO3 , 48.2% Fe ) . Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite ( greater than about 60% iron ) are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore , meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces . Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron , which is one of the main raw materials to make steel - 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel . Indeed , it has been argued that iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity , except perhaps oil .",

Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent .

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux , and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation 's many language dialects . The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions : the Dakota and Lakota . Before the 17th century , the Santee Dakota ( Is\u00e1\u014byathi ; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota ) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . They gathered wild rice , hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish . Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota , where the Western Dakota ( Yankton , Yanktonai ) and Teton ( Lakota ) were residing . In the 1800s , the Dakota signed treaties with the United States , ceding much of their land in Minnesota . Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time , as well as low food supplies , led to the Dakota War of 1862 , which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska , North and South Dakota and Canada . After 1870 , the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota , creating the present-day reservations in the state .

  "/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh": "Charles Augustus Lindbergh ( February 4 , 1902 - August 26 , 1974 ) was an American aviator , military officer , author , inventor , and activist . At age 25 in 1927 , he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the Orteig Prize for making a nonstop flight from New York to Paris . Lindbergh covered the \u200b33 1\u20442-hour , 3,600-statute-mile ( 5,800 km ) flight alone in a purpose-built , single-engine Ryan monoplane , the Spirit of St. Louis . Although not the first non-stop transatlantic flight , this was the first solo transatlantic flight , the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs , and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles , thus it is widely known as a turning point in the trajectory of aviation history and advancement . Lindbergh was an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve , and he received the United States ' highest military decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his transatlantic flight . His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail , which revolutionized the aviation industry , and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity . Lindbergh 's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy . In March 1932 , his infant son , Charles Jr. , was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the Crime of the Century . The case prompted the United States Congress to establish kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim . By late 1935 , the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe , from which they returned in 1939 . Before the United States entered World War II , Lindbergh was an advocate of non-interventionism and a supporter of Nazi Germany . He opposed not only the intervention of the United States , but also the granting of aid to the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/Stained_glass": "The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it . Throughout its thousand-year history , the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings . Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows , the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture . Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight .

It may also mean organizations that operate or control several individual elevators , in different locations . In Australia the term grain elevator describes only the lifting mechanism . ( See Usage , below . ) Before the advent of the grain elevator , grain was usually handled in bags rather than in bulk ( large quantities of loose grain ) . Dart 's Elevator was a major innovation . It was invented by Joseph Dart , a merchant , and Robert Dunbar , an engineer , in 1842 and 1843 , in Buffalo , New York . Using the steam-powered flour mills of Oliver Evans as their model , they invented the marine leg , which scooped loose grain out of the hulls of ships and elevated it to the top of a marine tower .

The railway 's most important route was between Minneapolis and Peoria , Illinois ; a second major route extended from Minneapolis into eastern South Dakota , and other trackage served areas in north-central Iowa and south-central Minnesota . The M & StL was founded in 1870 , and expanded through line construction and acquisition until the early 20th century . Most of the railway 's routes saw only relatively light traffic , and consequently the company 's financial position was frequently precarious ; the railroad operated under bankruptcy protection between 1923 and 1943 .

  "/wiki/Waterwheel": "A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of flowing or falling water into useful forms of power , often in a watermill . A water wheel consists of a wheel ( usually constructed from wood or metal ) , with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface . Water wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century but they are no longer in common use . Uses included milling flour in gristmills , grinding wood into pulp for papermaking , hammering wrought iron , machining , ore crushing and pounding fiber for use in the manufacture of cloth . Some water wheels are fed by water from a mill pond , which is formed when a flowing stream is dammed . A channel for the water flowing to or from a water wheel is called a mill race . The race bringing water from the mill pond to the water wheel is a headrace ; the one carrying water after it has left the wheel is commonly referred to as a tailrace . In the mid to late 18th century John Smeaton 's scientific investigation of the water wheel led to significant increases in efficiency supplying much needed power for the Industrial Revolution . Water wheels began being displaced by the smaller , less expensive and more efficient turbine , developed by Beno\u00eet Fourneyron , beginning with his first model in 1827 . Turbines are capable of handling high heads , or elevations , that exceed the capability of practical-sized waterwheels . The main difficulty of water wheels is their dependence on flowing water , which limits where they can be located . Modern hydroelectric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel , as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors .

Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power .

A member of the Democratic Party , he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century . Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression , implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history . As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System and defined American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century . His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II , which ended shortly after he died in office . He is rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents , along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , but has also been subject to substantial criticism . Roosevelt was born in Hyde Park , New York , to a Dutch American family made well known by the reputation of Theodore Roosevelt , the 26th president of the United States , and William Henry Aspinwall . FDR graduated from Groton School and Harvard College and attended Columbia Law School but left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City . In 1905 , he married his fifth cousin once removed , Eleanor Roosevelt . They had six children , of whom five survived into adulthood . He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910 , and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox 's running mate on the Democratic Party 's 1920 national ticket , but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding . In 1921 , Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness , believed at the time to be polio , and his legs became permanently paralyzed .",
  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms , and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 . It responded to needs for relief , reform , and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",

  "/wiki/Logging": "Logging is the cutting , skidding , on-site processing , and loading of trees or logs onto trucks or skeleton cars . Logging is the process of cutting trees , processing them , and moving them to a location for transport . It is the beginning of a supply chain that provides raw material for many products societies worldwide use for housing , construction , energy , and consumer paper products . Logging systems are also used to manage forests , reduce the risk of wildfires , and restore ecosystem functions . In forestry , the term logging is sometimes used narrowly to describe the logistics of moving wood from the stump to somewhere outside the forest , usually a sawmill or a lumber yard . In common usage , however , the term may cover a range of forestry or silviculture activities . Illegal logging refers to what in forestry might be called timber theft by the timber mafia . It can also refer to the harvesting , transportation , purchase , or sale of timber in violation of laws . The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal , including the use of corrupt means to gain access to forests ; extraction without permission or from a protected area ; the cutting of protected species ; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits . Clearcut logging is not necessarily considered a type of logging but a harvesting or silviculture method and is simply called clearcutting or block cutting . In the forest products industry logging companies may be referred to as logging contractors , with the smaller , non-union crews referred to as gyppo loggers . Cutting trees with the highest value and leaving those with lower value , often diseased or malformed trees , is referred to as high grading .",
