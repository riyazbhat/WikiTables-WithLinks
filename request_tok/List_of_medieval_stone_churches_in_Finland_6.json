Unique for having been built almost entirely of brick rather than stone , the church was a popular pilgrimage destination during the Middle Ages . A grey stone perimeter wall was added in the 16th century . The church contains paintings from the years 1510 through 1922 , as well as 40 wooden sculptures dating to the first half of the 14th century . Precious-metal crowns which had formerly belonged to the church were confiscated during the Reformation . The church pulpit , dating to 1550 , is the oldest surviving pulpit in Finland . A second pulpit was built in the 17th century . A bell tower next to the church dates to 1813 .
