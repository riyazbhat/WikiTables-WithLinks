There are various standards of evidence or standards showing how strong the evidence must be to meet the legal burden of proof in a given situation , ranging from reasonable suspicion to preponderance of the evidence , clear and convincing evidence , or beyond a reasonable doubt . There are several types of evidence , depending on the form or source . Evidence governs the use of testimony ( e.g. , oral or written statements , such as an affidavit ) , exhibits ( e.g. , physical objects ) , documentary material , or demonstrative evidence , which are admissible ( i.e. , allowed to be considered by the trier of fact , such as jury ) in a judicial or administrative proceeding ( e.g. , a court of law ) . When a dispute , whether relating to a civil or criminal matter , reaches the court there will always be a number of issues which one party will have to prove in order to persuade the court to find in his or her favour . The law must ensure certain guidelines are set out in order to ensure that evidence presented to the court can be regarded as trustworthy .",
  "/wiki/Damages": "At common law , damages are a remedy in the form of a monetary award to be paid to a claimant as compensation for loss or injury . To warrant the award , the claimant must show that a breach of duty has caused foreseeable loss . To be recognised at law , the loss must involve damage to property , or mental or physical injury ; pure economic loss is rarely recognised for the award of damages . Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages , which are economic losses such as loss of earnings , property damage and medical expenses , and general damages , which are non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress . Rather than being compensatory , at common law damages may instead be nominal , contemptuous or exemplary .",
