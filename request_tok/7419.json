Sarajevo has attracted international attention several times throughout its history . In 1885 , Sarajevo was the first city in Europe and the second city in the world to have a full-time electric tram network running through the city , following San Francisco . In 1914 , it was the site of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by local Young Bosnia activist Gavrilo Princip that sparked World War I , which also ended Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and resulted in the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . Later , after World War II , the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Second Yugoslavia led to a massive expansion of Sarajevo , then the constituent republic 's capital , which culminated with the hosting of the 1984 Winter Olympics marking a prosperous era for the city .",
