The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden ( 1955 ) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant ( 1956 ) .

  "/wiki/Cultural_icon": "A cultural icon is an artifact that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture . The process of identification is subjective , and icons are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture . When individuals perceive a cultural icon , they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented . Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another . In the media , many items and persons of popular culture have been called iconic despite their lack of durability , and the term pop icon is often now used synonymously . Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused . The values , norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it , and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values . Thus an apple pie is a cultural icon of the United States ' , but its significance varies among Americans . National icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime , for example , crowds destroying statues of Vladimir Lenin in Eastern Europe after the Revolutions of 1989 or burning the American flag to protest American actions abroad . Religious icons can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined , such as representations of the Madonna in societies with a strong Catholic tradition .",
  "/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause": "Rebel Without a Cause is a 1955 American drama film about emotionally confused suburban , middle-class teenagers .

  "/wiki/American_frontier": "The American frontier includes the geography , history , folklore , and cultural expression of life in the forward wave of American expansion that began with English colonial settlements in the early 17th century and ended with the admission of the last remaining western territories as states in 1912 . This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase , giving rise to the expansionist philosophy known as Manifest Destiny . A frontier is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement . Leading theorist Frederick Jackson Turner went deeper , arguing that the frontier was the defining process of American civilization : The frontier , he asserted , promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people . He theorized it was a process of development : This perennial rebirth , this fluidity of American life , this expansion westward.furnish [ es ] the forces dominating American character . Turner 's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians ( and critics ) to explore multiple individual American frontiers , but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of Native American lands west of the Mississippi River , in what is now the Midwest , Texas , the Great Plains , the Rocky Mountains , the Southwest , the West Coast , and Hawaii . In 19th- and early 20th-century media , enormous popular attention was focused on the Western United States in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century , from the 1850s to the 1910s , a period sometimes called the Old West or the Wild West . Such media typically exaggerated the romance , anarchy , and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect . This eventually inspired the Western genre of film , which spilled over into television shows , novels , and comic books , as well as children 's toys , games and costumes . As defined by Hine and Faragher , frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities , the use of the land , the development of markets , and the formation of states . They explain , It is a tale of conquest , but also one of survival , persistence , and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America . Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans : The existence of an area of free land , its continuous recession , and the advance of American settlement westward , explain American development .",

The Salkinds fired Donner after Superman 's release and commissioned Richard Lester as the director to finish Superman II . Lester also returned for Superman III ( 1983 ) , and the Salkinds further produced the related 1984 spin-off Supergirl before selling the rights to Cannon Films , resulting in the poorly reviewed Superman IV : The Quest for Peace ( 1987 ) . Ilya Salkind commissioned a fifth Superman script before Warner Bros. acquired the rights entirely in 1993 . Over the course of eleven years , Warner Bros. would develop and then cancel Tim Burton 's Superman Lives , which would have starred Nicolas Cage , Wolfgang Petersen 's Batman vs. Superman , and the J. J. Abrams scripted Superman : Flyby , which went between directors Joseph McG Nichols and Brett Ratner .

The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

Officially , the broadcast network retains its own sports division ; however , for all practical purposes , ABC 's sports division has been merged into ESPN Inc. , the parent subsidiary of cable sports network ESPN that is majority owned by ABC 's corporate parent , The Walt Disney Company , in partnership with Hearst Communications . ABC broadcasts use ESPN 's production and announcing staff , and incorporate elements such as ESPN-branded on-screen graphics , SportsCenter in-game updates , and the BottomLine ticker .

When ABC acquired a controlling interest in ESPN in 1984 , it operated the cable network separately from its network sports division . The integration of ABC Sports with ESPN began after The Walt Disney Company bought ABC in 1996 . The branding change to ESPN on ABC was made to better orient ESPN viewers with event telecasts on ABC and provide consistent branding for all sports broadcasts on Disney-owned channels ( shortly thereafter , ESPN2 's in-game graphics were likewise altered to simply use the main ESPN brand ) . Despite its name , ABC 's sports coverage is supplemental to ESPN and ( with occasional exceptions ) not a simulcast of programs aired by the network , although ESPN and ESPN2 will often carry ABC 's regional broadcasts that otherwise would not air in certain markets .",
