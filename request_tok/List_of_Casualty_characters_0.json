Sub-specializations of emergency medicine include disaster medicine , medical toxicology , ultrasonography , critical care medicine , hyperbaric medicine , sports medicine , palliative care , or aerospace medicine . Different models for emergency medicine exist internationally . In countries following the Anglo-American model , emergency medicine was originally the domain of surgeons , general practitioners , and other generalist physicians , but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality in its own right with its own training programmes and academic posts , and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners . By contrast , in countries following the Franco-German model , the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists ( for critical resuscitation ) , surgeons , specialists in internal medicine , pediatricians , cardiologists or neurologists as appropriate . In developing countries , emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited",
