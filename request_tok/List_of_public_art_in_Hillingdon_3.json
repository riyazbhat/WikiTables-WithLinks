There appears to be confusion due to the similarity in names Decius and Dacian . However his veneration only appears late in Christian tradition , and did not become widespread in the Western Church until the Late Middle Ages , although churches and monasteries were named after him by the 7th century . His most famous legend tells that he carried a child , who was unknown to him , across a river before the child revealed himself as Christ . Therefore , he is the patron saint of travelers , and small images of him are often worn around the neck , on a bracelet , carried in a pocket , or placed in vehicles by Christians .",
  "/wiki/Mural": "A mural is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall , ceiling or other permanent surfaces .

Some wall paintings are painted on large canvases , which are then attached to the wall ( e.g. , with marouflage ) , but the technique has been in common use since the late 19th century .",

  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary": "The Immaculate Heart of Mary is a devotional name used to refer to the interior life of the Blessed Virgin Mary , her joys and sorrows , her virtues and hidden perfections , and , above all , her virginal love for God the Father , her maternal love for her son Jesus , and her compassionate love for all people . The Eastern Catholic Churches occasionally utilize the image , devotion , and theology associated with the Immaculate Heart of Mary . However , this is a cause of some controversy , some seeing it as a form of liturgical latinisation . The Roman Catholic view is based on Mariology , as exemplified by Pope John Paul II 's Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae . Traditionally , the heart is depicted pierced with seven wounds or swords , in homage to the seven dolors of Mary . Also , roses or another type of flower may be wrapped around the heart .",
  "/wiki/Oil_painting": "Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder . Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil , poppy seed oil , walnut oil , and safflower oil . The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint , such as the amount of yellowing or drying time . Certain differences , depending on the oil , are also visible in the sheen of the paints . An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired . The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium . The oil may be boiled with a resin , such as pine resin or frankincense , to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss . Although oil paint was first used for Buddhist paintings by painters in central and western Afghanistan sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries , it did not gain popularity until the 15th century . Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages . Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known . The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe , and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of tempera paints in the majority of Europe . In recent years , water miscible oil paint has become available .",
