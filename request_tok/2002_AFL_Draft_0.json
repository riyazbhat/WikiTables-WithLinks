  "/wiki/Luke_Penny": "Luke Penny ( born 8 February 1981 ) is a former Australian rules footballer . Recruited to the Western Bulldogs in the 1998 AFL Draft as pick 14 , Penny was seen as a project player who could lead the defence in years to come . He stood at 193 cm , and made his debut in 2000 . With Matthew Croft at the club , he could not cement his spot at the Bulldogs , so was traded to St Kilda Football Club for pick 17 ( which turned out to be Cameron Faulkner ) in the 2002 AFL Draft . Making his debut with the Saints in 2003 , Penny continued to improve in a key-defensive position , and became first-choice full-back at the club . However , in 2004 and particularly 2005 , Penny started having trouble with his knees . In 2005 he played just 9 games and was a figure in the Saints ' massive injury list throughout the year . At the end of the 2005 season , Penny 's knee injuries had become a massive problem and it was widely known that he was considering retirement . At just 24 years of age , on 29 November , Penny made his retirement official , with 3 years remaining on his contract ."
