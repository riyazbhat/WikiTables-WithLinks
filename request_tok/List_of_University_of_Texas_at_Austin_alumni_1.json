  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years",
  "/wiki/Reconstruction_era_in_the_United_States": "The Reconstruction era was the period in American history which lasted from 1863 to 1877 . It was a significant chapter in the history of American civil rights . The term has two applications : the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War ; the second , to the attempted transformation of the 11 former Confederate states from 1863 to 1877 , as directed by Congress , and the role of the Union states in that transformation . Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and abolished slavery , making the newly freed slaves citizens with civil rights ostensibly guaranteed by three new constitutional amendments . Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction : the reconciliationist vision , which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought ; the white supremacist vision , which included segregation and the preservation of the traditional cultural standards of the South ; and the emancipationist vision , which sought full freedom , citizenship , and constitutional equality for African Americans . When President Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated at the end of the Civil War , Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat from Tennessee and former slave holder , became president . Johnson favored rapid measures to bring the South back into the Union , allowing the Southern states to determine the rights of former slaves . Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger , federal measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans , including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , while curtailing the rights of former Confederates , such as through the provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill . Johnson , the most prominent Southerner to oppose the Confederacy , followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates . Lincoln 's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the suffrage of all freedmen , whereas Johnson and the Democratic Party were strongly opposed to this . Johnson 's weak Reconstruction policies prevailed until the congressional elections of 1866 . Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states , including the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans massacre of 1866",

It is thus well-suited for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or where it persists across multiple searches . The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses information gathered during the preprocess step to skip sections of the text , resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string search algorithms . In general , the algorithm runs faster as the pattern length increases . The key features of the algorithm are to match on the tail of the pattern rather than the head , and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters rather than searching every single character in the text",

Social work applies social sciences , such as sociology , psychology , political science , public health , community development , law , and economics , to engage with client systems , conduct assessments , and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems ; and to bring about social change . Social work practice is often divided into micro-work , which involves working directly with individuals or small groups ; and macro-work , which involves working with communities , and - within social policy - fostering change on a larger scale . The social work industry developed in the 19th century , with some of its roots in voluntary philanthropy and in grassroots organizing . However , responses to social needs had existed long before then , primarily from private charities and from religious organizations .

  "/wiki/Nonlinear_dynamics": "In mathematics and science , a nonlinear system is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input . Nonlinear problems are of interest to engineers , biologists , physicists , mathematicians , and many other scientists because most systems are inherently nonlinear in nature . Nonlinear dynamical systems , describing changes in variables over time , may appear chaotic , unpredictable , or counterintuitive , contrasting with much simpler linear systems . Typically , the behavior of a nonlinear system is described in mathematics by a nonlinear system of equations , which is a set of simultaneous equations in which the unknowns ( or the unknown functions in the case of differential equations ) appear as variables of a polynomial of degree higher than one or in the argument of a function which is not a polynomial of degree one . In other words , in a nonlinear system of equations , the equation ( s ) to be solved can not be written as a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in them . Systems can be defined as nonlinear , regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations . In particular , a differential equation is linear if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives , even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it . As nonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve , nonlinear systems are commonly approximated by linear equations ( linearization ) . This works well up to some accuracy and some range for the input values , but some interesting phenomena such as solitons , chaos , and singularities are hidden by linearization . It follows that some aspects of the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear system can appear to be counterintuitive , unpredictable or even chaotic . Although such chaotic behavior may resemble random behavior , it is in fact not random . For example , some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic , where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout",

Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States .

In 1984 , Dr. Castleman teamed up with Donald Winkler of the NASA Johnson Space Center and founded Perceptive Systems , Inc ( PSI ) in Houston , Texas . That company manufactured automated microscope systems for use in genetic diagnosis and sold them internationally . PSI was later reformed as Perceptive Scientific Instruments , Inc. ( PSII ) and eventually sold to IRIS International in 1996 . IRIS established it as a Research and Development Center under the name Advanced Digital Imaging Research ( ADIR ) , with Dr. Castleman as president . He retired in 2008",
  "/wiki/Master_of_Science": "A Master of Science ( Latin : Magister Scientiae ; abbreviated MS , M.S. , MSc , M.Sc. , SM , S.M. , ScM or Sc.M . ) is a master 's degree in the field of science awarded by universities in many countries or a person holding such a degree . In contrast to the Master of Arts degree , the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences , engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects ; however , different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences . While it ultimately depends upon the specific program , earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a thesis",

Crippen received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor . Crippen participated in the recovery operations for the remains of crew members after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster",
  "/wiki/STS-1": "STS-1 ( Space Transportation System-1 ) was the first orbital spaceflight of NASA 's Space Shuttle program . The first orbiter , Columbia , launched on 12 April 1981 and returned on 14 April , 54.5 hours later , having orbited the Earth 36 times . Columbia carried a crew of two - mission commander John W. Young and pilot Robert L. Crippen . It was the first American crewed space flight since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975 . STS-1 was also the only maiden test flight of a new American spacecraft to carry a crew , though it was preceded by atmospheric testing of the orbiter and ground testing of the Space Shuttle system . The launch occurred on the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight . This was a coincidence rather than a celebration of the anniversary ; a technical problem had prevented STS-1 from launching two days earlier , as was planned"
